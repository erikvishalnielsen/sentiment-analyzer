        "content": "Investing.com \u2013 ASML (AS:ASML) shares jumped on Wednesday after Reuters reported that the U.S. will exempt some allied countries from new restrictions on chip equipment exports to China.\n\nThe Biden administration is set to unveil a new regulation next month that will enhance U.S. authority to halt the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to certain Chinese chipmakers, the report stated citing two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe new rule, an extension of the Foreign Direct Product rule, will target about half a dozen of China's most advanced chipmaking fabs. The regulation aims to curb China's progress in supercomputing and artificial intelligence, potentially benefiting its military capabilities.\n\nCountries such as Israel, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia are expected to be affected, while major allies exporting critical chip making equipment, including Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea, will be excluded from these restrictions.\n\nASML and Tokyo Electron will be unaffected by this new rule, the report said. This exclusion is significant as it allows these companies to continue their operations without the disruptions anticipated for other equipment manufacturers.\n\nThe draft rule, still subject to change, underscores the U.S. strategy to maintain pressure on China's semiconductor sector while avoiding friction with key allies. The new regulations will also lower the threshold for U.S. content in foreign products, closing a loophole that previously allowed certain products to bypass export controls.\n\nThe U.S. also plans to add about 120 Chinese entities to its restricted trade list, including chipmaking fabs, toolmakers, and providers of electronic design automation (EDA) software.\n\nThis move reflects ongoing efforts to counter China's advancements in semiconductor technology while maintaining diplomatic relations with allied countries.\n\nThe strategic exemptions for Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea highlight the U.S.'s diplomatic balancing act. According to the Commerce Department, country classifications are based on diplomatic relationships and security concerns, ensuring that export controls are both effective and fair.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nASML shares jump on U.S. exemption from China chip export restrictions - Reuters\n\nExclusive-New US rule on foreign chip equipment exports to China to exempt some allies, sources say\n\nJust Eat Takeaway posts strong profitability, shares rise\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Company Most Vital to Artificial Intelligence (AI) Just Dipped. Time to Buy?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the most dominant investing theme in the market today. Given the technology's wide implications, it's not surprising that many stocks associated with the trend have been some of the best performers this year. However, one of the most vital (I would argue the most vital) has recently dipped, which could provide investors with a buying opportunity.\n\nSo what's this company that is arguably the most vital in all of AI? It's not Nvidia, but one of the companies that supplies a technology that makes its chips possible.\n\nToday's AI doesn't happen without ASML\n\nThere are many technologies involved in making chips, but one company holds a technological monopoly on a vital process: ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). ASML's products give chip manufacturers the capability to perform the lithography process at a microscopic scale. Through its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology, manufacturers can create chips with electrical traces that are only a few nanometers apart.\n\nASML is the only company in the world that uses this technology, so if you want to make the most powerful and cutting-edge chips, you have to use ASML's machines. Consequentially, this makes ASML the most important company in the AI value chain, as the innovative GPUs that Nvidia creates wouldn't be possible without those machines.\n\nBecause ASML is further upstream than some of the end use cases for AI, it's not seeing the same demand that companies like Nvidia are, which is throwing investors off. This was evident in its second-quarter results when it posted net sales of 6.2 billion euros compared to 6.9 billion last year. This seems like a huge problem for many investors, as AI demand should be driving sales up, not down.\n\nBut this analysis isn't sound. Anyone who has been listening to ASML's quarterly conference calls knows that 2024 is a preparation year for 2025, which management has repeatedly stated will be a much stronger year. In fact, 2025 was mentioned nearly as many times in the Q2 conference call as 2024. Clearly, management wants investors to prepare for 2025 and just ignore what's going on in 2024.\n\nWall Street analyst projections also back up this sentiment, as they only expect 2% revenue growth in 2024 but 33% in 2025. After ASML's most recent sell-off, it's clear some investors may have forgotten about this, which is a prime opportunity to take advantage of now.\n\nWhen using 2025 estimates, ASML doesn't look terribly expensive\n\nBefore reporting earnings, ASML traded for more than 50 times forward earnings -- a valuation that is very expensive but isn't very accurate because it doesn't include all of 2025's strong projections.\n\nStory continues ASML PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nTo properly assess where ASML's stock is trading, we'll need to use 2025 earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates. Twenty analysts expect ASML to post $32.64 EPS in 2025. Dividing today's near-$900 stock price by that figure yields a valuation of 27 times 2025 earnings.\n\nWhile that's not a fire-sale valuation by any measure, it is much more palatable than the 43 times forward earnings it trades at now. With the stock down more than 20% since ASML reported earnings, I think now may be a smart time to start initiating a position.\n\nInvestors have few opportunities to invest in true monopolies, and this is one of them. ASML is the sole provider of a vital technology for making cutting-edge chips. The demand for these chips will likely only increase, making ASML a smart investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "ASML Holding\u2019s ASML shares have gained 13.9% year to date, underperforming the industry\u2019s return of 16.8% and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 17.2%. This modest gain came amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s resilience can be attributed to its comprehensive product portfolio, which is aligned with customers\u2019 roadmaps, making it capable of delivering cost-effective solutions to support all kinds of applications. ASML\u2019s growing investments, expanding position in the memory market and increasing design wins have been positives.\r\n\r\nHowever, market uncertainties, persistent inflation, geo-political tensions and the rising cost of technological innovations have been concerning for the company.\r\n\r\nIncreased pricing pressure due to rising competition from major industry players like Lam Research LRCX and Applied Materials AMAT is an added risk for ASML.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven the combination of both risks and rewards, many investors may wonder how to play the ASML stock at present. In order to answer this, it is essential to delve into the details and analyze various factors at play.\n\nIndustry Trends Favoring ASML\n\nThe semiconductor industry is continuing its dream run so far this year. It is expected to accelerate its recovery journey in the second half of 2024, banking on the growing proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. These factors bode well for the company.\r\n\r\nImproving wafer fabrication equipment spending is a major positive from ASML.\r\n\r\nRising demand for advanced nodes to support the build-up of the digital infrastructure, including growth drivers such as 5G, AI and high-performance computing solutions, is a plus. As the technology nodes continue to shrink, the demand for the company\u2019s products continues to increase.\r\n\r\nGlobal megatrends in the electronics industry are expected to continue fueling the company\u2019s growth in the semiconductor market.\r\n\r\nIncreasing lithography intensity is driving the demand for ASML products and services.\n\nFactors to Drive Long-Term Growth\n\nTo capitalize on the above-mentioned industry trends, ASML is making solid investments both in capacity rampup and technology innovation, which bode well for its long-term prospects.\r\n\r\nThe company is improving lithography tool utilization levels at both logic and memory customers to address the growing memory demand. ASML expects growth in memory revenues for 2024 from that reported in 2023 on the back of DRAM technology node transitions, which are required to support advanced memories.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s increasing investments in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) infrastructure remain a plus. In second-quarter 2024, its net system bookings were EUR 5.6 billion, of which\r\nEUR 2.5 billion came from EUV bookings.\r\n\r\nStrength in low numerical aperture (NA) and high NA machines is a positive. Based on this, the company expects EUV revenue growth in 2024. The rising uptake of the NXE:3800 low NA machine, which has the capability to deliver a robust performance with a productivity of 220 wafers per hour, is expected to contribute well to 2024 EUV sales. In regard to high NA, the rising shipment of 0.55 NA EUV is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ASML is getting orders from a number of new fabs being constructed across the world. Management expects a better second half of 2024 and a cyclical upturn for 2025. ASML\u2019s growing efforts to add and improve fab capacity to meet current and future customer demand with the support of its supply-chain partners are positives.\n\nStory continues\n\nUpward Estimate Revision\n\nASML is well-positioned to ride on the growing proliferation of AI, energy transition and global megatrends in the electronics industry on the back of its strong product portfolio and technology innovation. This, in turn, will benefit its long-term prospects.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $30.18 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 1.3%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings stands at $20.30, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 5.7%. The estimate has been revised 0.9% upward over the past 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEnd Note\n\nAlthough the long-term prospects of this leading manufacturer of advanced technology systems for the semiconductor industry remain rosy, the uncertainties surrounding the company\u2019s growth trajectory are concerning.\r\n\r\nEnd-market volatility and escalating U.S.-China tensions are negatives. The U.S. government is now reportedly planning to tighten restrictions on chip exports to China.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s mounting expenses associated with capacity rampup and technological innovation are expected to hurt its margin expansion. It expects a lower gross margin for 2024 than that reported in 2023 due to increasing high NA costs. \r\n\r\nWeakening momentum in logic does not bode well for ASML. The company expects lower logic revenues this year than that reported last year.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ASML is currently trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 32.68X compared with the industry\u2019s 27.27X, reflecting a stretched valuation. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven these headwinds, investors should not rush in to buy the stock at present. Instead, they should monitor the stock\u2019s developments closely for a more appropriate entry point, as an erroneous and hasty decision could affect portfolio gains.\n\nCurrently, ASML Holding carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

        "title": "Forget AMD: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "The world's five-most-valuable companies by market capitalization each have prominent positions in technology, leading areas such as consumer products, cloud computing, chip design, and software. As a result, tech stocks are crucial growth drivers in the stock market. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite index has risen 304% over the past decade, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 181% rise.\n\nConsequently, it's not a bad idea to dedicate some of your holdings to this high-growth industry. Chipmakers are particularly attractive now, creating the hardware that makes most tech possible. Among them is Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), which holds the second-largest market share in graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). AMD supplies its chips to companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon -- and its stock has climbed 41% over the past 12 months.\n\nHowever, AMD's earnings have yet to catch up to that growth, making the stock overvalued. In fact, it is currently trading at 228 times its earnings, suggesting it could be best to consider better-valued investment options in this tech sector.\u00a0 So, forget AMD and consider buying these two tech stocks instead.\n\n1. ASML Holding NV\n\nThe general public might not be as familiar with ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) as AMD, as it doesn't develop products for the consumer sector. However, ASML's role is arguably more essential to the future of technology.\n\nASML is a Dutch semiconductor-equipment company and the world's leading producer of lithography systems. The company's deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems are crucial components to manufacturing chips of all kinds, with the former specializing in larger chips and the latter capable of producing smaller and denser hardware.\n\nThe company has achieved an 83% share in the lithography market, enabling key sectors like telecommunications, data centers, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) to advance their technology. As a result, ASML boasts a prominent clientele, including leading chip manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, and Samsung.\n\nOver the past five years, ASML's quarterly revenue has steadily risen 102%, with operating income climbing 159%. Meanwhile, free cash flow has skyrocketed 327%. Consistent earnings growth has been primarily driven by the fact that ASML's foundry customers need to regularly purchase more EUV systems to stay competitive.\n\nASML's stock has dipped 10% in the last month as the company has faced increased restrictions on chip exports to China, brought on by rising tensions between the U.S. and the East Asian nation. However, ASML's monopolization of lithography systems remains a compelling reason to invest, as budding industries like AI drive chip demand and leading manufacturers build plants in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech giant's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently sits at about 50, which doesn't exactly scream bargain. However, that is considerably lower than AMD's figure of 228, meaning ASML's stock offers far more value. Meanwhile, ASML's dominant and consistent growth over the long term makes it worth its premium share price.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has experienced considerable volatility over the last month. After a series of peaks and valleys, its share price has fallen by about 3%, while rival AMD's has tumbled by 4%. This chart shows the fluctuation Nvidia investors have endured over the past 30 days amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China. NVDA Chart\n\nBut despite the recent sell-off, tech's long-term growth potential and the crucial role that chips play in that development mean these companies remain attractive investments for the long haul. And like ASML, Nvidia holds one of the industry's most dominant and reliable roles.\n\nNvidia's desktop GPU market share jumped by more than 20 points over the last decade, hitting 88% this year. The company's powerful chips have nearly wiped out the competition, with AMD's GPU share falling from 35% to 12% in that period and Intel's sinking to 0%. The difference saw Nvidia's gaming revenue pop 18% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, while the same segment for AMD posted a sales decline of 47%.\n\nNvidia's success in desktop GPUs has allowed it to expand and dominate other areas of tech. The company is now responsible for about 85% of the AI chip market.\n\nShares in Nvidia have climbed 177% in the last 12 months to $123 per share. However, its vast reach in tech and AI indicates it still has plenty more to offer investors, and Wall Street seems to agree. Two separate analyst firms have raised Nvidia's price target, with Loop Captial increasing theirs from $120 to $175 per share and recommending buy. Meanwhile, Piper Sandler has raised their price target from $120 to $140 per share.\n\nNvidia's P/E is high at 71, but it is still a far better value than AMD. Its massive growth potential in AI and multiple tech markets make its stock a better option than AMD and worth investing in today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "Stock market sell-offs happen for a variety of reasons, but no matter the cause, it is inevitable that many investors will be gripped by fear. This can lead to even more selling, creating a cascade effect.\n\nHowever, these moments of panic can also present unique opportunities to purchase stocks at a discount. By focusing on strong businesses during market downturns, investors can uncover some wonderful buying opportunities at attractive prices.\n\nHere are three growth stocks with strong secular tailwinds at their backs that should position them to thrive even when the stock market takes a hit.\n\nBroadcom\n\nSemiconductor and infrastructure software company Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) has been on quite a run lately as the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) demand has been very good for its business. In its most recently reported quarter, Q2 of 2024, Broadcom's AI-related revenue grew by 280% year over year. That level of growth is unsustainable, but it demonstrates that the company is in the right place at the right time.\n\nEven before this AI-driven revenue increase, Broadcom was performing well as a business. It has been consistently profitable and it routinely and consistently generates free cash flow. However, it also traded for a much more reasonable valuation. Today its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 69, compared to 25 in late 2023.\n\nNvidia\n\nNo company has exemplified the AI boom as strikingly as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which saw astonishing revenue growth in its data center segment in 2023 and ignited the AI hype cycle for numerous companies. In the first quarter of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended May 2023), data center revenue totaled $4.3 billion. One year later it was $23 billion.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue gets the headlines because that's where its AI-related chip revenue is recognized. However, Nvidia is a well-diversified business, with chips that have applications for gaming, automobiles, and professional visualization. The growth in data centers will eventually slow, but Nvidia has other use cases for its chips that should help sustain revenue.\n\nThe stock's P/E multiple of 72 is expensive but has come down considerably over the past year. If the growth seen over the latest several quarters continues, investors could still come out ahead even from today's lofty valuation. That said, this would be a wonderful company to grab shares of when the market takes a turn for the worse.\n\nASML\n\nNone of the growth that Broadcom and Nvidia have seen is possible without Dutch lithography company ASML(NASDAQ: ASML). Lithography is the process of etching patterns onto the silicone used in semiconductors. For the most cutting-edge chips, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) is necessary and ASML is the only company in the world that makes the machines needed for this advanced process.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering all the AI hype in the markets, it might come as a surprise that the semiconductor industry is in a cyclical decline right now. This has been clear in ASML's recent results. In Q2 of 2024, revenue declined 10% year over year, following a 21% decline in the previous quarter. ASML's management has stated this has everything to do with the cyclical nature of the industry. It expects the remainder of the year to be a challenge but forecasts a return to growth in 2025.\n\nDespite the struggles the company has seen lately, the market is certainly bullish on the future. ASML's valuation has steadily risen over the last year and shares now trade for a P/E of 51. If there's any signs of weakness in AI demand, this could be a stock that sells off. Whenever shares go on sale, investors would be wise to pay attention.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Promising Semiconductor Stocks to Scoop Up in July 2024",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks are about to take off in a big way!\n\nThe semiconductor sector is poised for an exciting resurgence in 2024, powered by advances in artificial intelligence (AI). This surge in AI is increasing the demand for more advanced and efficient chips, resulting in considerable growth in the semiconductor space.\n\nAs the demand for cutting-edge chips increases, investors can score big with semiconductor companies. Statista anticipates a strong turnaround in the industry, with worldwide semiconductor sales expected to reach a whopping $607.4 billion this year, a significant improvement from past declines.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, if the Federal Reserve follows through with rate cuts, it could substantially boost U.S. equities. This is especially true for semiconductor companies leading the push for innovative technologies.\n\nTherefore, these three semiconductor stocks have the potential for high returns on investment, making them suitable for any portfolio.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) The logo for Micron Technology Inc (MU) is displayed on a large white and blue building.\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has established itself as a cornerstone in the semiconductor industry for over four decades. This extensive experience is reflected in its impressive track record, with shares soaring by 34.16% year-to-date (YTD) and a phenomenal 241.8% over the past decade.\n\nThe company\u2019s strength lies in its continuous work on memory and storage technologies, particularly for AI applications. Take its multiplexed rank dual inline memory modules (MRDIMMs), for example. They provide stellar performance, which is ideal for AI inference. Additionally, MU introduced one of the most compact UFS 4.0 mobile storage solutions, which improves mobile users\u2019 experience.\n\nThe increasing demand for these innovations has boosted Micron\u2019s earnings. The company reported $6.8 billion in revenue in the third quarter, up an impressive 81.53% year-over-year (YOY). Profits also escalated to 62 cents per share, a remarkable 48% jump from the previous quarter, far surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations of nine\u00a0cents per share. This marked Micron\u2019s fifth consecutive earnings beat and reinforced its positive trajectory, setting a strong foundation for even more profits.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) is the technological engine of the industry\u2019s most advanced photolithography systems, which produce microchips. These are the brains of everything from smartphones to high-tech servers. Like the rest of its peers, the stock has performed brilliantly, rising 37.5% annually and a mind-boggling 313% in the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML recently released its Q2 results, which showed a robust 18% sequential growth in overall sales to $6.8 billion, slightly above market expectations. However, the company\u2019s projection for the next quarter fell short, leading to a stock pullback. That said, the forecast for 2025 seems positive, with greater industry use of EUV tools for AI-driven DRAM and logic markets putting ASML on track for major expansion.\n\nMoreover, while ASML\u2019s stock trades at a premium trailing-year price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50.48x, the company\u2019s leadership in EUV technology makes up for the valuation. Investors should consider buying the dip, as ASML is well-positioned to benefit from the AI surge and beat its competitors in the coming time.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a no-brainer among high-potential semiconductor companies. As the world\u2019s largest foundry for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, TSMC has seen its stock skyrocket by 72.37% in the last year, thanks to its key position in the AI revolution.\n\nMost importantly, TSMC remains the backbone of AI-related technology advancements. Their 3-nanometer technology (N3 node) is expected to be a high-volume product for years. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) uses all of TSMC\u2019s N3 capacity\u00a0for Arm-based smartphone and Mac PC chips. Additionally, TSMC is stepping up a notch by establishing a strong new chip packaging plant, increasing its AI chip production capability.\n\nFurthermore, TSMC\u2019s Q2 results demonstrate its competitive edge, with revenue of $20.82 billion, up 32.8% year over year. Their 3-nanometer shipments accounted for 15% of overall wafer revenue. Earnings-per-share (EPS) came in at $1.48, above forecasts by six cents. This impressive performance positions TSMC toward a $1 trillion market capitalization. They anticipate Q3 sales of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion, illuminating unstoppable growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Technology Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "No single stock you own is likely to meaningfully help you become a millionaire, but there are some rare exceptions. Among these exceptions, the odds are good that they reside in the tech sector. Technology is ultimately behind most of the world's greatest advancements, after all. That's why technology stocks have outperformed the market on average for three decades now and will likely continue to do so for decades to come.\n\nHere's a closer look at three underestimated and overlooked technology stocks, each of which has the potential to help make you a millionaire. You just need to allocate enough capital to them now, and then be willing to let time do its thing.\n\n1. Qualcomm\n\nIf you own a desktop or laptop computer, it's most likely built around an Intel-made processor. And if you're a user of any artificial intelligence (AI) platform -- even if you don't know it -- Nvidia's tech is probably at the heart of the system. And if you rely on any wireless connectivity tech ... well, it's probably made by Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM).\n\nSmartphones, Wi-Fi chips, Bluetooth headsets, home security systems, in-car connectivity, and wearables are all in Qualcomm's repertoire. Without Qualcomm, the consumer-tech world would look considerably different.\n\nPerhaps most important to would-be investors right now, Qualcomm is focused on the technology market's biggest and best opportunity at this time: artificial intelligence (and mobile AI tech in particular). The company's Snapdragon mobile processor is powerful enough to turn a smartphone into a device capable of handling generative AI duties rather than offloading them to the cloud (as most generative AI work is still done at this time). Although this tech is still young, meaningful commercialization of it is on the horizon.\n\nThis small firecracker of the technology arena is expected to explode over the next several years. Market research firm Global Market Insights believes the mobile AI market is set to grow at an annualized pace of 25.5% through 2032, syncing with outlooks from Spherical Insights and Mordor Intelligence. That's nearly a 20-fold increase in the size of a market that Qualcomm already dominates, meaning the company's likely to capture more than its fair share of this growth between now and the end of that eight-year stretch. This business's growth, however, certainly isn't going to come to a screeching halt then.\n\nGranted, most of this progress will take shape later rather than sooner. Analysts believe Qualcomm's top-line is only set to improve a respectable-but-modest 7% this year before accelerating to an also-respectable-but-modest pace of just over 10% next year. Earnings are expected to improve at only a slightly faster clip during this two-year stretch as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the AI-driven demand for wireless technology that's already becoming evident, however, Qualcomm stock could still readily start reflecting its strength on this front sooner rather than later.\n\n2. ASML\n\nNetherlands-based ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) is similar to Qualcomm in the sense that you're benefiting from its tech without even realizing it. It's taking a completely different tack, however, toward becoming indispensable. See, ASML makes equipment that helps chipmakers manufacture their own processors and circuit boards.\n\nIt's called lithography, or in ASML's case, extreme ultraviolet (or EUV) lithography. This is the science of using light to \"spray\" a pattern of conductive material onto a substrate that eventually becomes a computer chip. This process is more cost-effective than alternative approaches, and it also allows for higher-performance semiconductor chips due to the tech's light-based ability to make the smallest of hardware.\n\nAnd it's big business to be sure.\n\nSee, these chip-manufacturing systems can sell for a few hundred-million dollars each. That's the chief reason shares are up on the order of 1,000% in just the past 10 years, and higher to the tune of 6,000% for the past 20. It's already made several millionaires out of investors with the foresight to recognize the importance of this chipmaking tech and ASML's dominance of the market. It's got no real rivals on this front.\n\nMore of the same is likely in the cards too. The increasing use of technology (like generative-AI-capable smartphones) means demand for more and better semiconductor foundry solutions isn't just still growing, but accelerating. Mordor Intelligence says the EUV lithography market is set to grow at an average annual pace of more than 11% through 2029; Data Bridge Market Research pegs the number at 20%. Even the lower of the two is still extremely bullish for ASML though, in light of its leading market share and patent portfolio.\n\nSure, the company seems to be a recurring victim of intellectual property theft and unlicensed usage of its know-how. That's arguably the top risk to ASML investors, in fact.\n\nIt's still not a major risk, though. Would-be competitors generally can't steal enough of ASML's tech to truly threaten the company's dominance of the EUV lithography market. Ordinary patent infringement and enforcement can handle the rest.\n\n3. IonQ\n\nLast but certainly not least, add IonQ(NYSE: IONQ) to your list of technology stocks with the potential to help make you a millionaire.\n\nSimply put, IonQ offers a whole new kind of computing. In contrast with the device you're using right now (which still ultimately operates on the decades-old binary system that boils digital information down to a combination of ones and zeros), so-called quantum computers use atomic particles as the basis for computations. Not limited by an either/or dichotomy, quantum computing platforms can simultaneously handle millions of single-digit inputs. The end result? These systems operate tens of millions of times faster than ordinary computers.\n\nThat's the millionaire-making potential of this nascent technology, by the way. Whereas familiar artificial intelligence solutions are finally delivering on the years-long vision for modern-day computer architecture, quantum computing offers options that weren't even conceivable until very recently; the world still doesn't fully appreciate or even understand everything these tools could be capable of doing.\n\nIt is figuring them out quickly though. Research outfit SkyQuest suggests the global quantum computing market is set to grow at an annualized pace of almost 31% through 2031, making it eight times bigger then than it was last year.\n\nIonQ's role in this evolution is simple enough -- it builds quantum computing systems, and then either sells them or rents time-based access to them. The company did $7.6 million worth of business during the first quarter of this year, up 77% year over year, and in line with the full year's as well as next year's growth forecast.\n\nGranted, that's still not a lot. It's not like IonQ is the only tech company building quantum computing systems either. IonQ is arguably leading the way in terms of cost-effective performance, however, and at the same time offers the most accessible, user-friendly access to such platforms. Indeed, IonQ's CEO Peter Chapman believes widespread adoption of his company's tech is just a few years down the road specifically because of the strides it's made to become the industry's most marketable player.

        "title": "ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "ASML (ASML) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned -8.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, to which ASML belongs, has lost 8.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ASML is expected to post earnings of $5.44 per share, indicating a change of +4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.30 points to a change of -5.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.70 indicates a change of +56.1% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ASML.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ASML _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor ASML, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.66 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.18 billion and $40.8 billion estimates indicate +1.3% and +35.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nASML reported revenues of $6.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.6%. EPS of $4.32 for the same period compares with $5.37 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.9%. The EPS surprise was +11.63%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nASML is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ASML. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is ASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML) the Best AI Semiconductor Stock to Buy for 2025?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.Since ASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\n\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for \u201cthematic purity\u201d while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in \u201cbellwether\u201d stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\n\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning \u00a0AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company\u2019s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is ASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML) Best AI Stock to Buy Based on New AI ETF?\n\nASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 75\n\nASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML) is the ninth-biggest holding of the KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX).\n\nASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML) shares are down amid the company\u2019s guidance that is based on fears of an expansion of restrictions by the US government on semiconductor exports to China. Management\u2019s guidance for the third quarter fell short of expectations, predicting 7-17% quarter-on-quarter growth to \u20ac6.7B-\u20ac7.3B, below the consensus estimate of \u20ac7.67B.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, some analysts believe geopolitical fears are priced in ASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML) and the stock has secular growth catalysts amid the rise in semiconductor demand following the AI boom. More specifically, ASML bulls believe the company\u2019s Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has bright days ahead. The demand for EUV lithography tools is expected to skyrocket by 2025 and beyond driven by the need for advanced tools in DRAM and foundry/logic markets. The EUV tech is necessary for the manufacturing of developing advanced process nodes.\n\nASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML) remains a key beneficiary of this demand. A Jefferies report cited the company\u2019s CFO who said that improved orders from TSMC (TSM) will drive the company\u2019s 2025 outlook.\n\nASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML) has a near monopoly in the semiconductor industry as its machines are used by chip manufacturers to make physical chips.\n\nASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) supplies ultraviolet lithography photolithography machines used to manufacture advanced 3nm and 5nm chips. Jim Kelleher of Argus has set a $1,000 price target on the stock.\n\nASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML)\u00a0was\u00a0one of the stocks pitched during the SOHN Conference this year. Vijay Shilpiekandula of Dilation Capital, who was named the Sohn Idea Contest Winner, presented ASML as his best stock idea.\n\n\u201cWhat I find like good opportunity for investors in the market to think about right now is to be creative about the long-term capacities and the long-term earnings potential of this company based on this gold rush that all these memory makers and large language models are chasing,\u201d Shilpiekandula said\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its\u00a0fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNetherlands-based\u00a0ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world\u2019s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.\u201d\n\nOverall, ASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of ASML Holding NV (AMS:ASML), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ASML but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Make no mistake about it \u2014 artificial intelligence is powering a technological revolution. Humans now interact with machines and solve problems in ways we never have before. Machine learning and AI are being applied to image recognition, language processing and decision-making in ways that are revolutionizing the world around us. Certain companies are central to those technological changes, many of which are publicly traded. Those are the AI stocks powering the technological revolution that investors must not ignore.\n\nAI is impacting industries across the economy. From automation to medicine to everything else, AI will change everything. Generative AI has proven especially important in the early stages of AI\u2019s emergence. It can produce text and images that challenge human creativity.\n\nThe impact of artificial intelligence is only beginning to be understood. It will create substantial value that investors are eager to capitalize on. These three stocks are powering the revolution and making strong investments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a major player to consider if you\u2019re interested in investing in a stock that will power the future of AI.\n\nBefore discussing the generalities that power Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing as one of the leading AI stocks, we must first understand the news. TSMC just raised its full-year revenue guidance above 25% on a U.S. dollar basis. It had previously been at a low to mid 20% growth range on a US dollar basis.\n\nIn the second quarter, net profits increased by 36% due to the extremely strong demand for the AI chips it produces on a contract basis for many of the world\u2019s leading companies. Quarterly revenues increased by 40%.\n\nThe strong performance by TSMC is a strong signal to an AI sector that has been facing concerns lately. Raised guidance should help soften those fears and perhaps kickstart a renewed round of optimism around AI. The AI hardware opportunity just got restarted, and TSMC is at the heart of it all.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I write this, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is rebounding during premarket trading after falling 8% in the previous session. The TSMC news seems to come just at the right time for all AI stocks, including Nvidia.\n\nNvidia and other AI stocks faced a sharp sell-off as concerns over new regulations on Chinese chip imports reemerged. Furthermore, Trump\u2019s comments about Taiwan reignited more speculation about the future of the AI sector and the role the U.S. will play in defending Taiwan should Trump be elected to a second term in November.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless, the strong news from TSMC bodes well for Nvidia. It will likely be more than enough to prompt an AI stock resurgence. Nvidia will likely show signs of a strengthening H2, as TSMC noted the second half of 2024 will be strong.\n\nNvidia continues to power the AI technological revolution by producing the most powerful chips overall. It is simply an investment to make or be left behind.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) will continue to deal with the threat of further sanctions, but it\u2019s still the standard bearer in its domain. Therefore, it remains one of the best choices among AI stocks that power the revolution.\n\nThe Biden administration has floated the idea of additional sanctions to tighten export restrictions on AI equipment to China. This would directly affect ASML, making the most advanced machines to produce AI chips.\n\nI believe political figures \u2014 Trump and Biden \u2014 will come to their senses about the economic ramifications of their recent respective comments. Each is trying to project American power through those comments, but both know that AI is a big part of tenuous economic gains at the moment. Neither is likely to jeopardize that.\n\nThat\u2019s why ASML\u2019s strong earnings report will take center stage, not Biden\u2019s comments. Those better-than-expected earnings and those from TSMC are setting the stage for a strong second half for AI stocks in 2024. ASML is a key player and makes a great investment for that reason. Its EUV machines are in low supply and high demand for their application to produce the most advanced chips. That\u2019s more important than bluster from either side of the aisle.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The recent rotation out of tech stocks has only made the decline in some names worse. Already battered and bruised, many of the most disliked tech stocks have fallen sharply since the beginning of July as investors shift capital into value stocks and small-cap securities. This has worsened an already bad situation.\n\nEven before the rotation began, certain tech stocks were unloved by investors. Declining sales, poor earnings, competitive threats and eroding operations conspired to drag certain tech stocks sharply lower over the past year. And the situation does not appear to be improving at many of the most beaten-down companies.\n\nAs a result, investors would be smart to get their money out of these three tech stocks by August 1.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVerizon (VZ) Verizon store sign. VZ stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nU.S. telecommunications giant Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has just reported second-quarter financial results that were pretty underwhelming. The company announced an EPS of $1.15, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. However, Verizon\u2019s revenue in the quarter totaled $32.80 billion, which missed analyst forecasts that had called for $33.06 billion. Sales were up 1% from a year ago.\n\nThe wireless internet provider also failed to raise its outlook. Instead, it maintained its full-year 2024 financial guidance. For all of 2024, Verizon expects its wireless service revenue to grow about 2% and is forecasting EPS of $4.50 to $4.70. Those numbers are at the low end of Wall Street forecasts. VZ stock declined 6% on news of the Q2 print. Year-to-date, the stock is up just over 3%.\n\nThe ho-hum results and outlook make Verizon a tech stock to sell.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nEuropean semiconductor giant ASML Holding\u2019s (NASDAQ:ASML) stock also took a big hit after its recent Q2 print. ASML reported revenue of 6.24 billion euros, which beat analyst expectations for 6.03 billion euros. The company said its orders increased 24% year-over-year in Q2 as global demand for artificial intelligence (AI) processors strengthened.\n\nWhile that news might seem positive, ASML\u2019s profit actually declined 18.7% year-over-year. The company\u2019s revenue was down 10% from a year earlier. Management continues to refer to 2024 as a \u201ctransition year.\u201d ASML is also being hurt by export restrictions to China, which the Dutch government implemented at the request of the U.S. Even with the export controls, China remains a huge market for ASML, accounting for 49% of its global sales. The China exposure is seen as the company\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML stock is down 12% a week after delivering its Q2 financial results.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Lucid Air Touring sedan display at the Service Center.

The latest terrible news is that Lucid is recalling 5,200 of its 2022-2023 luxury Air sedans due to a software error that can cause a loss of power while driving. This is the second recall impacting the company\u2019s signature EV. Lucid previously recalled 7,500 of its Air sedans due to problems with a coolant heater that could fail to defrost the windshield.\n\nAt the end of May, Lucid announced that it\u2019s cutting 6% of its workforce, or about 400 employees, as it struggles with a sales decline and slowing growth. The company said that it will incur $25 million in charges related to the workforce reduction, which it plans to complete by the end of this year\u2019s third quarter. While the Lucid Air has won critical praise from the automotive press, its high price has led to diminished sales.

        "title": "China\u2019s Slowdown Is Taking a Rising Toll on European Profits",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- From luxury brands to car makers, European companies are taking a hit from China\u2019s slowdown, and more trouble is coming for businesses heavily reliant on demand in the Asian economic giant.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Initial Polling Data Show About the Trump-Harris Matchup I Changed My Mind. The Fed Needs to Cut Rates Now. Harris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of Her Tesla Slumps as Musk Tethers Its Future to Delayed Robotaxis Singapore Has World\u2019s Most Powerful Passport After Unseating Europeans\n\nHugo Boss AG, Burberry Group Plc, and Daimler Truck Holding AG are among the high-profile names whose bottom line has been hurt by customers there turning more cautious. LVMH joined the growing list late Tuesday, reporting that sales in the region that includes China dropped 14% in the second quarter.\n\nLVMH shares fell 5% early Wednesday in Paris, and they\u2019ve lost 23% over the past 12 months.\n\nLess money spent on European goods has severe implications for profits, as well as creating risks for share prices, company valuations, even jobs. Swatch Group, for example, saw China sales plunge 30% in the first half and is cutting production.\n\nExecutives may hope this is a short-term blip, but it\u2019s not clear how China turns things around. It\u2019s dealing with multiple problems, from a deepening property crisis to faltering consumer spending and rising trade tensions.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategists are recommending that investors sell European stocks that derive the bulk of their sales from China.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about the exposure to China,\u201d said Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \u201cProfit warnings from European companies again this earnings season have already flagged the risk of weaker-than-anticipated demand from China, especially the consumer.\u201d\n\nIn the near-term, the impact of China\u2019s downturn has already trickled through into earnings, boding ill as the reporting season heads toward its peak in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nLuxury brands in particular pinned their fortunes on the lucrative Chinese market in recent years, but the slowdown is now putting them under pressure.\n\nShares in Hugo Boss and Burberry were among those to suffer last week as the two fashion groups issued profit warnings. German car maker Porsche AG slumped on Tuesday after a supply shortage added to the pressure from the slowing sales in China.\n\nAnd industrial goods manufacturers are also in focus after ABB Ltd. blamed a double-digit drop in Chinese orders for its poor quarter.\n\nA Goldman Sachs basket of European stocks with high sales exposure to China has underperformed the broader market this year. Strategists including Lilia Peytavin advises selling such stocks in favor of those more reliant on US sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nChinese authorities did announce some growth-friendly measures at their recent twice-in-a decade Third Plenum, but they showed little urgency to boost demand or arrest the property slump. It means European companies that benefited during the country\u2019s boom time are likely facing a continued slowdown in Chinese appetite for foreign goods and services.\n\nGermany looks especially vulnerable, with UBS strategists estimating it accounts for half of the European Union\u2019s exports to China.\n\nAmong individual companies, it highlighted miners BHP Group and Rio Tinto Plc, bank Standard Chartered Plc and car maker Volkswagen AG as firms that earn more than 40% of their revenue from the country.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s domestic weakness has been a multi-year drag but was overshadowed by strength in the US,\u201d strategists led by Gerry Fowler said in a note. \u201cNow that both regions appear to be slowing, the nascent European recovery is vulnerable, again, to external forces.\u201d\n\nSwatch, the maker of Omega, Blancpain and Tissot watches, is responding to the drop in China demand by lowering production by between 20% and 30%. It\u2019s also cutting costs, but isn\u2019t reducing its workers in Switzerland in a significant way.\n\nChief Executive Officer Nick Hayek says the company wants to be ready to ramp up production when China demand recovers, though he doesn\u2019t expect a significant turnaround this year.\n\nInvestor nervousness around tariffs has also hit semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding NV, Europe\u2019s third-largest company by market value.\n\nReliant on China for almost half its sales, ASML saw its stock tumble 17% last week on concern the US could slap fresh curbs on companies that supply Beijing with advanced chip technology.\n\nFinally, China is a problem for some European manufacturers as it emerges as a competitor, threatening profits in a range of sectors, from semiconductors to chemicals.\n\nThat rivalry is also playing out in the form of tariffs, with the EU imposing temporary duties on electric vehicles made in China. The uncertainty is already affecting earnings: Sweden\u2019s Volvo Car AB has trimmed its auto sales forecast for this year, given its EVs are made in China.\n\nAs the earnings season continues, \u201cpeople will be looking particularly at guidance from the more export-sensitive European names, just looking for any signs of how they\u2019re seeing both the impact of China as an end market, but also as a competitor,\u201d said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at Aviva Investors. \u201cThat is going to be an important theme.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Michael Msika, Farah Elbahrawy and Joshua Gallu.\n\n(Updates with LVMH shares in third paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into Airbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly The Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand Elon Musk Goes All In for Trump Why Is the US Deficit So Big?

        "title": "7 High-Growth Stocks for the Speculating Investor",
        "content": "While the slow-and-steady approach to market success is arguably the most sensible, investors must realize that the y-axis (the percentage gains and losses) is not the only plane of reality to consider. Instead, they should also monitor the x-axis or how much time it takes to extract positive returns. The shorter the x-axis, the better for you, which is why high-growth stocks are so relevant.\n\nWith these entities, we\u2019re not just focused on the growth itself. If the x-axis was of no consideration, then it would be best to consider only the biggest of blue chips. Over the past 50 years or more, these entities have witnessed remarkable y-axis growth. But man oh man did it consume a bunch of x-axis metrics; that is time.\n\nGuess what? You\u2019re human. You really don\u2019t have that much time \u2013 at least, not much quality time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, I\u2019m not here to rush you. However, a balanced portfolio will take into account enterprises that are geared for upside in the quickest time possible. With that, below are high-growth stocks for speculators to consider.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Person holding cellphone with logo of US semiconductor company Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. Broadcom stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology giant that manufactures a range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. It\u2019s enticing because of its recent downfall. On Friday, AVGO stock suffered a loss of nearly 2%. In the trailing month, it\u2019s off the pace by more than 9%. In other words, it\u2019s time for a relative discount.\n\nRight now, AVGO stock trades at 16.6X trailing-year sales. Without question, that\u2019s a blisteringly hot multiple. Even compared to the prior year (between the first quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024), the metric sat at 11.44X. Still, investors may want to consider nibbling at Broadcom while it\u2019s relatively deflated.\n\nLooking ahead to the end of the year, analysts project the top line to land at $51.46 billion. That\u2019s up a staggering 43.7% from the prior year\u2019s print of $35.82 billion. What\u2019s more, the high-side estimate calls for $52.39 billion. And in the following year, the metric could soar to just over $60 billion. With that in mind, AVGO makes a compelling case for high-growth stocks.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the world\u2019s most important enterprises, which is a good-enough argument for high-growth stocks. It provides photolithography equipment which is used to print intricate designs on silicon wafers. To say that it\u2019s a vital component of the technology ecosystem would be an understatement.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, ASML stock got beat down by the recent tech sector rout. On Friday, shares lost more than 3% of equity value. In the past five sessions, they\u2019re down almost 18%. For many speculators, that type of loss would be too difficult to ignore. It\u2019s not as if fundamentally the company has become irrelevant. Right now, shares trade for 12.67X trailing sales. That\u2019s a modest premium over the prior year\u2019s print of 11.34X.\n\nEnticingly, analysts see upside over the next two years. Initially, for fiscal 2024, they\u2019re targeting a modest bump up to $30.48 billion. That\u2019s an increase of 3.7%. However, by the following year, sales could soar to $40.29 billion. If so, that would imply growth of 32.2%. It\u2019s one of the high-growth stocks to consider.\n\nDisney (DIS) Legendary Disney castle of sleeping beauty in Disneyland\n\nSource: Konstantin Yolshin / Shutterstock.com\n\nDisney (NYSE:DIS) might seem a risky case for high-growth stocks because the entertainment giant has courted significant controversy. Basically, conservative thought leaders blame the Magic Kingdom for shoving liberal talking points down the audience\u2019s throat. However, \u201cwoke\u201d content \u2013 such as movies that meaningfully and authentically celebrate diversity \u2013 tends to perform well.\n\nIf so, that bodes well for Disney. Look, no matter where you fall under the political and ideological spectrum, you can understand that such a massive international brand will not back away from forwarding diversity. And also, business is business: if it works, it will keep doing it. That makes the relative discount of DIS stock so attractive.\n\nRight now, shares trade hands at 1.97X revenue. In the past year, the metric landed at 2.02X. Further, in Q1 of this year, the metric was as high as 2.52X. The idea here is that Disney can grow into its prior valuation.\n\nAnalysts are looking for fiscal 2024 and 2025 revenue to hit $91.34 billion and $96.05 billion. That\u2019s up 2.7% and 5.2%, respectively.\n\nConocoPhillips (COP) a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) arguably makes an excellent case for high-growth stocks to buy. A multinational energy firm, ConocoPhillips is engaged in the exploration, production and marketing of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Basically, it\u2019s tied to the upstream component of the hydrocarbon value chain. Due to fears of global supply chain disruptions, upstream players could see increased demand over the next few years.\n\nDespite the compelling backdrop, COP stock is trading for a relatively modest premium to sales at 2.48X. Now, that\u2019s a bit higher than the sector average 2.12X. But here\u2019s the thing: in the past year, the metric averaged around 2.13X. So, the upswing isn\u2019t that dramatic considering the relevancy boost of the underlying business.\n\nNow, it must be said that analyst projections may need to catch up to current geopolitical realities. For fiscal 2024, experts believe that sales may land at $58.14 billion, down 0.7% from last year. However, the high-side estimate calls for $68.56 billion. That seems more reasonable again due to the fears of disruption.\n\nUber (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber (NYSE:UBER) really needs no introduction. As a pioneer of the ride-sharing industry (and the concept of the sharing economy), Uber has become an everyday reality. Even better, the company has expanded to disrupt other components of the sharing space. For example, Uber Eats offers food deliveries. And it\u2019s also moving into the freight and logistics ecosystem.\n\nAnother factor to consider about UBER stock is that analysts love the idea. However, the application software firm is technically undervalued. Right now, shares trade hands at 3.68X trailing-year sales. The average for the application software sector is 4.12X. So, given the tremendous footprint of the business, UBER can easily grow into the average valuation of the industry.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, analysts are targeting sales of $39.46 billion for fiscal 2024. If so, that would be up 13.3% from the prior year\u2019s haul of $34.83 billion. And in the following year, revenue could jump to $45.6 billion. That\u2019s up another 15.6%.\n\nWith UBER stock down more than 6% in the trailing week, it may be time to consider picking shares on the dip.\n\nGrab (GRAB) Motorcycle helmet with Grab logo on a motorcycle parked at the road side\n\nSource: Nor Sham Soyod / Shutterstock.com\n\nA Southeast Asian technology firm, Grab (NASDAQ:GRAB) offers a wide range of services. These include ride sharing, food delivery, digital payments and financial services. It\u2019s almost like the Uber of Southeast Asia but with even more utility. Based on the underlying fundamentals, investors should be all over this opportunity.\n\nStill, GRAB stock was shaky during Friday\u2019s session. In the past week, it lost more than 6% of market value. Also, the technical trend appears decisively negative since the May 20 session. Nevertheless, for speculators, this framework could spell opportunity. Right now, shares trade hands at 5.32X trailing-year sales. While that\u2019s elevated compared to other application software firms, in the past year, the metric stood at 6.73X.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts project that sales may hit $2.77 billion. If so, that would imply a growth rate of 17.5%. Further, the high-side estimate calls for revenue of $2.94 billion. In the following year, the top line may rise to $3.24 billion, up another 16.9%. It\u2019s one of the high-growth stocks to keep on your radar.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) A smartphone displays the Pinduoduo (PDD) website.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you really want to dial up your risk-reward profile, take a look at PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD). A Chinese e-commerce platform, PDD combines social networking and online shopping under one umbrella. Basically, the aim here is to facilitate collective retail bargains. While a relevant offering, the issue centers on the viability of China\u2019s consumer economy.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a speculative idea, that\u2019s for sure. Since the beginning of the year, PDD stock incurred a loss of almost 9%. A lot of that red ink came from the trailing month, when the equity incurred a nearly 8% dip. Still, for those who believe in the resilience of the world\u2019s second-largest economy, PDD is very compelling.\n\nFor one thing, shares trade at 4.76X trailing-year revenue. In the past year, however, this metric clocked in at 5.95X. Thus, PDD stock can grow into its prior valuation. What\u2019s more, analysts believe that sales may reach $57.56 billion. If so, that would be a meteoric growth rate of 65.2%. And in the following year, revenue could rise to $75.64 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "content": "ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) is one of the world's most important semiconductor equipment companies. It's the largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only supplier of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems for producing the world's smallest and densest chips.\n\nASML's monopolization of that crucial technology enabled it to increase revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% from 2013 to 2023. Its stock has soared nearly 980% over the past decade and boosted its market cap to $373 billion. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nASML should continue growing, but it could be tough to replicate its gains from the past decade. Therefore, growth-oriented investors should probably seek out smaller chip equipment makers that have more upside potential. Could one such company be Aehr Test Systems(NASDAQ: AEHR), a maker of chip testing equipment that only has a market cap of $550 million?\n\nWhat does Aehr Test Systems do?\n\nAehr produces semiconductor testing and burn-in equipment. It didn't attract much attention when it went public at $8 a share in 1997, and its stock eventually tumbled below $1 during the nadir of the Great Recession in 2009.\n\nFrom fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2020 (which ended in May 2020), Aehr's annual revenue rose at a CAGR of less than 1%. As a result, most investors likely forgot about the company until the meme stock rally in 2021.\n\nBut since the beginning of 2021, Aehr's stock has surged 644%. Its shares rallied as more investors recognized it as an underappreciated play on the expanding silicon carbide market.\n\nSilicon carbide chips can operate at higher voltages, temperatures, and frequencies than traditional silicon chips. That resilience makes them well-suited for short-length LEDs, lasers, 5G base stations, military radar, and electric vehicles (EVs). According to The Brainy Insights, the global silicon carbide market could expand at a compound annual rate of 12% from 2024 to 2033.\n\nYet only a handful of chipmakers -- including Wolfspeed, Infineon, Onsemi, and STMicroelectronics -- currently produce silicon carbide chips. Meanwhile, only a few companies like Aehr provide the equipment to test and burn in those wafers.\n\nHow fast is Aehr Test Systems growing?\n\nAehr suffered a major slowdown in fiscal 2021 as the pandemic disrupted the semiconductor market. But its growth accelerated significantly in fiscal 2022 as the expansion of the EV market drove more silicon carbide chipmakers to upgrade their manufacturing capabilities, and those tailwinds persisted throughout fiscal 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nMetric FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 Revenue growth 6% (26%) 206% 28% 2% Operating margin (11%) (25%) 17% 21% 15%\n\nData source: Aehr Test Systems.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Aehr's growth decelerated as the EV market cooled off and some of its clients faced tougher macro headwinds. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Aehr's revenue to climb at a CAGR of 18% as the cyclical downturn ends.\n\nIn its latest earnings press release, Aehr CEO Gayn Erickson said the silicon carbide market still represented an \"enormous opportunity\" and would \"continue to be a key contributor to revenue in the current fiscal year and beyond.\" Erickson also said there was \"growing demand\" for testing and burn-in equipment in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market.\n\nBut can investors really compare Aehr to ASML?\n\nAehr is an interesting way to profit from the secular expansion of the silicon carbide market, but it probably won't expand and evolve into the next ASML for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Aehr could still face intense competition in the semiconductor testing and burn-in equipment market from bigger and better diversified companies like Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron. That pressure could prevent Aehr from scaling up its business and expanding its gross margin.\n\nSecond, there's no indication that Aehr can monopolize its market with a unique technology. By comparison, ASML developed its EUV technology for three decades before it finally delivered its first EUV systems in the early 2010s.\n\nEven investors optimistically assume Aehr can increase its revenue at a compound annual rate of 15% from 2024 to 2034 as its forward price-to-sales ratio holds steady, its market cap would only grow from $550 million to $2.1 billion by the final year. That would nearly be a four-bagger gain from its current price, but it wouldn't come close to matching ASML's returns from the past decade.\n\nTherefore, Aehr Test Systems could benefit from the long-term growth of the silicon carbide market, but it probably won't be mentioned in the same breath as ASML, Applied Materials, or Tokyo Electron in the foreseeable future. It should also remain a much more speculative investment than those larger semiconductor equipment makers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Aehr Test Systems right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Aehr Test Systems, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Aehr Test Systems wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will ASML Holding Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) is a critical player in the semiconductor industry, as chipmakers and foundries use its equipment to manufacture chips. That explains why the Dutch semiconductor equipment giant has clocked impressive gains on the stock market in the past five years. ASML Chart\n\nThe robust demand for ASML's chipmaking equipment to fulfill the growing need for semiconductors has led to a nice jump in its revenue and earnings, as seen in the preceding chart. The good part is that ASML seems built for more growth over the next five years, as the demand for its offerings remains solid amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. This became evident from the company's results for the second quarter of 2024, released on July 17.\n\nLet's take a closer look at ASML's latest quarterly performance and check why investors can expect more upside in this semiconductor stock over the next five years.\n\nASML sees big boost in bookings but investors still hit the panic button\n\nAll eyes were on the bookings ASML received in the second quarter, and that figure of 5.6 billion euros was well ahead of analysts' expectations of 4.41 billion euros. ASML's bookings stood at 4.5 billion euros in the same quarter last year and 3.6 billion euros in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nSo the company's order book increased nicely last quarter, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting that ASML received 2.5 billion euros' worth of orders for its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines last quarter, accounting for almost half of its total orders for the period.\n\nThese EUV machines are used for making advanced chips based on smaller process nodes, which are capable of delivering high computing power while consuming less electricity. Foundries and chipmakers are using these EUV machines to churn out AI chips, which explains why its EUV bookings increased by 56% on a year-over-year basis, contributing to a sizable backlog worth 39 billion euros.\n\nHowever, investors pressed the panic button following ASML's results for a couple of reasons and the stock fell 12%. First, the company's revenue outlook of 7 billion euros for the current quarter is lower than the Street estimate of 7.5 billion euros. Second, concerns about restrictions on ASML's sales to China have also contributed to the sell-off in ASML stock following its latest results.\n\nThat's because China accounted for almost half of ASML's top line last quarter, and the demand for the latter's older equipment is strong in that country. So reports that the Biden administration is considering imposing stricter restrictions on sales of semiconductor technology to China are weighing on ASML stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors shouldn't miss the bigger picture\n\nInvestors would do well to take a look at the broader picture, as the healthy demand for AI chips over the next five years should allow ASML to overcome any potential loss of business in China should stricter sanctions be imposed. The global AI chip market is expected to generate $296 billion in revenue in 2030, growing at an annual rate of 33% during the forecast period. This should create demand for more EUV lithography equipment.\n\nAccording to Market Digits, the EUV lithography market could generate $37 billion in revenue in 2030, compared with $9 billion last year. ASML has a monopoly in EUV lithography machines, which means that it is set to enjoy robust incremental revenue growth as this market expands in the long run.\n\nMoreover, ASML is expecting to return to growth in 2025 following a flat revenue performance in 2024, driven by the recent recovery in the semiconductor market which is fueled by catalysts such as AI. Analysts are expecting its top line to increase 3% in 2024 to $30.2 billion, but the forecast for the next couple of years is quite solid. ASML Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nASML should be able to sustain such healthy growth for a longer time considering the long-term opportunity in the AI chip market. Analysts are expecting its earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 21% for the next five years. However, ASML's earnings are expected to grow at a much faster pace in 2025 and 2026 following a small decline in the current year from last year's levels of $21.22 per share. ASML EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThere's a good chance that ASML could grow at a faster pace than analysts' expectations over the next five years on the back of AI-driven demand for its chipmaking equipment, and that could lead the market to reward this AI stock with healthy gains. That's why investors would do well to capitalize on the drop in ASML stock following its latest earnings report, as it could bounce back and soar higher in the long run thanks to the catalysts I've discussed.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "With stock market volatility returning for the hottest days of summer, investors may be pondering whether it\u2019s too late to rotate into some of the still-cheap growth stocks. Especially those that didn\u2019t really participate in the first-half market rally.\n\nThe mid-cap surge came fast and furiously. Though the cap rotation may still have a ways to go, the easy money, as they say, has likely already been made.\n\nIn any case, staying diversified is key to steering clear of ugly sector and theme-specific sell-offs. The Nasdaq took an amplified hit on Wednesday, with most of the damage concentrated in the semiconductor scene. Indeed, those who refused to take profits in such hot plays should have seen brutally volatile days like Wednesday coming.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough battered, the semiconductor industry may still offer terrific long-term buying opportunities and growth stocks. Particularly for investors who are ready to roll with the punches. Here are three growth stocks to consider buying after the July pummeling.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Exterior view of Nvidia's global headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Since its founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhenever Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares give you a chance to buy on the dip, you may wish to consider taking it. Undoubtedly, buying NVDA stock on weakness has been met with handsome rewards. And, though this time may very well feel different, the company\u2019s dominance and leading position in the AI race remain reasons to consider braving any extreme drawdowns.\n\nOn such a brutal single-day decline for semis, I found it somewhat surprising that NVDA stock wasn\u2019t down by double-digits. After all, it has been one the hottest stocks on the market. And with that, it should have the most room to fall once momentum swings the other way.\n\nNo doubt, a 6.6% single-day decline is undoubtedly painful for Nvidia stockholders. However, the damage done was less than your average semi-stock. And, a heck of a lot less than its top rival, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which sank 10.2% on the day.\n\nLam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a semiconductor equipment maker primed to gain as AI chip spending continues. But with an expanded multiple and very sharp gains put in since June, LRCX stock seemed overdue for another one of its corrections. After shedding 10% in a single day, it only took one day for shares to return to correction territory for the second time this year.\n\nThough the latest correction is the most painful yet, the dip below $1,000 per share seems more like a buying opportunity than anything else.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, geopolitical unrest around Taiwan is unsettling for Lam Research shareholders. Particularly given how much business it does with foundry giant Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). However, I view the concerns of geopolitical uncertainties as overdone. The stock looks incredibly cheap at 35.5 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), especially given its critical role in the global semi market.\n\nASML (AMSL) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is another semiconductor equipment maker that found itself under pressure on Wednesday. On a turbulent day for semis, ASML stock shed nearly 13% of its value.\n\nDespite leading semis and the broader tech sector lower on the day, I don\u2019t view ASML\u2019s growth narrative as significantly changed. ASML is still the powerhouse it was before, and the firms it serves are still capitalizing on the AI boom. Further, ASML still has a virtual monopoly when it comes to the types of machines it makes.\n\nThough Taiwan Semiconductor is a huge customer for ASML, I wouldn\u2019t be so quick to rule out a surge in ASML equipment orders from the foundry giant. Indeed, after the latest plunge, the name seems notably less risky despite uncertainties surrounding Taiwan.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Semiconductors continue to have outsized importance in the modern world. Microchips and processors power everything from our refrigerators and cars to our smartphones and computers. Increasingly important, they power artificial intelligence (AI) applications and models. Semiconductors have become so vital that they are often referred to as the \u201coil of the 21st Century.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global semiconductor market was worth $611.35 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $2.06 trillion by 2032, for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 15%. While there\u2019s been a downturn in semiconductor stocks recently, the pullback is not likely to last long given how important the technology is in the world today.\n\nHere are three semiconductor stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) has just reported financial results for this year\u2019s second quarter and they were very good. In fact, the company reported a 40% year-over-year increase in its revenue due to rising demand for the AI microchips that it manufactures at its foundries. TSMC, as the company is known, makes the majority of the world\u2019s microchips and processors.\n\nTSMC reported revenue of 673.51 billion New Taiwan dollars ($20.82 billion U.S.), which beat forecasts of NT$657.58 billion. Net income was NT$247.85 billion compared to NT$238.8 billion that had been expected among analysts. The company\u2019s revenue in Q2 rose 40.1% from a year earlier, while its profit increased 36.3%. CEO C.C. Wei said that he continues to expect 2024 to be \u201ca strong growth year for TSMC.\u201d\n\nTSMC held a 62% share of the global foundry market in this year\u2019s first quarter, up from 59% in the same period a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. While its pulled back recently amid broad sector rotation, TSM stock is still up 65% this year.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nTo Europe now. Dutch semiconductor giant ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) also just reported its latest financial results and they were equally encouraging. ASML announced that its orders increased 24% year-over-year in Q2 as global demand for AI processors strengthens. ASML is one of the world\u2019s leading semiconductor companies as it makes extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that are needed to produce the most advanced microchips.\n\nFor Q2, ASML reported revenue of 6.24 billion euros ($6.80 billion U.S.), which beat analyst expectations for 6.03 billion euros. The company\u2019s net profit totaled 1.58 billion euros versus 1.43 billion euros that was forecast on Wall Street. While its latest results showed strength, ASML\u2019s revenue was down nearly 10% from a year earlier and its profit declined by 18.7% year-over-year. The company has been hurt by export restrictions to China, which the Dutch government implemented at the urging of the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven with the export controls, China remains a huge market for ASML, accounting for 49% of its Q2 sales. Uncertainty around China has weighed on ASML stock lately. However, the company\u2019s share price is still up nearly 30% on the year.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nU.S. chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) looks like an enticing semiconductor stock after its just completed 10-for-1 stock split. AVGO stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis July 15. The company\u2019s share price was lowered from $1,700 a share to $170, making the stock much more affordable, especially for retail investors. A 10% decline in Broadcom\u2019s stock since the split now has shares trading around $155 each.\n\nAs with the other semiconductor stocks on this list, the current pullback in Broadcom is due to sector rotation and doesn\u2019t reflect the strength of the company. Along with its stock split, Broadcom reported financial results that beat Wall Street estimates across the board. For Q1, Broadcom posted EPS of $10.96 versus $10.84 that was expected. Revenue totaled $12.49 billion compared to $12.03 billion forecast on Wall Street.\n\nBroadcom is benefiting from the current boom in AI with its microchips in high demand. The company is also getting a boost from VMware, the enterprise software company it acquired for $69 billion last year. Year-to-date, Broadcom stock is up 43%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It's also the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems for manufacturing the world's most advanced chips.\n\nAs a linchpin of the global semiconductor market, ASML has cyclical growth. But from 2018 to 2023, its revenue still rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% as its earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 27% -- even as the broader market was disrupted by the pandemic, supply chain issues, and macro headwinds.\n\nThat's because ASML's top customers -- including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, and Samsung -- need to consistently buy more EUV systems to stay in the \"process race\" of manufacturing smaller, denser, and more power-efficient chips. ASML's monopolization of that crucial technology, which will continue with its latest generation of \"high-NA\" EUV systems, gives it a lot of pricing power.\n\nASML suffered a temporary slowdown over the past year as European regulators barred the company from shipping some of its older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems to Chinese chipmakers. But from 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 13% as it laps that deceleration, ships more EUV systems, and benefits from the secular expansion of the AI market. They expect its EPS to rise at a CAGR of 21%.\n\nASML's stock might seem a bit pricey at more than 50 times forward earnings, but I believe it will head much higher as the market's demand for its systems outstrips the available supply.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom produces a wide range of wireless, optical, and data storage chips. It also built a massive infrastructure software business by acquiring CA Technologies, Symantec's enterprise security unit, and VMware over the past few years.\n\nFrom fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023, which ended last October, Broadcom's revenue increased at a CAGR of 11% as its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) grew at a CAGR of 16%. Some of that growth was driven by its big acquisitions across the semiconductor and infrastructure software markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom expects to generate about a fifth of its revenue from AI-oriented chips in fiscal 2024. That growth, which mainly comes from its network and optical chips for data centers, should offset the macro-induced softness of its enterprise and telecom markets. The expansion of its software business should also curb the company's dependence on Apple, which accounted for a fifth of its sales in its past two fiscal years.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and adjusted EBITDA to both grow at a CAGR of 23%. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 27 times this year's adjusted EBITDA, and it should remain one of the most balanced ways to profit from the growth of the chipmaking, AI, and infrastructure software markets.\n\n3. Micron\n\nMicron is the world's third largest producer of DRAM chips and fourth largest supplier of NAND chips. Samsung and SK Hynix lead both of those markets, but Micron consistently produces denser chips than its larger South Korean rivals.\n\nMicron experienced a severe slowdown last year as PC shipments declined and the 5G smartphone upgrade cycle cooled. The company's revenue plunged 49% in fiscal 2023, which ended last September, as it turned unprofitable. However, Micron's growth is finally accelerating again as the PC market stabilizes, the mobile market recovers, and the AI market expands.\n\nMicron expects the growth of the AI market to be a major secular tailwind, since data centers will need to upgrade their memory chips to store the information being fed to Nvidia's AI-processing GPUs.\n\nAnalysts expect Micron's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 42% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 as its core markets grow again. They also expect the company to turn profitable again in fiscal 2024 and grow its EPS at a CAGR of 305% over the following two years. That's an incredible growth rate for a stock that still trades at 15 times next year's earnings. And it could soar much higher over the next few years as a new multiyear growth cycle begins.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think ASML (ASML) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about ASML (ASML) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nASML currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.32, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.32 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy, representing 84.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ASML Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for ASML\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ASML here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ASML, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs ASML Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ASML, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.9% over the past month to $20.30.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ASML. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ASML may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Major U.S. indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq \u2014 have given investors a positive return of 7.9%, 16.2% and 19.1%, respectively, in the year-to-date period.\n\nAccording to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, inflation for the month of June saw a dip for the first time in more than four years. The CPI fell 0.1% monthly due to cheap gasoline prices and moderating rents. On a yearly basis, CPI increased by 3%. The above data suggests that inflation in the second quarter resumed its downward trend.\n\nThe labor market is also slowly cooling off. Unemployment is steadily ticking up and job creation is slowing down. The nonfarm payrolls rose by 206,000 in June compared to the revised target of 218,000 in May, while the unemployment rate breached 4% for the first time in over two years in June.\n\nEven after favorable macroeconomic data, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after his two-day testimony in front of Congress, said that the central bank will not cut interest rates until it finds greater confidence that inflation is headed toward its desired target. All eyes will be on the Fed\u2019s upcoming meeting from Jul 30-31 as investors are expecting an interest rate cut in September.\n\nIn such a situation, prudent investors who wish to invest their money for regular income and capital preservation if things go south, can remain invested in or buy dividend stocks. These companies, due to their well-established businesses, pay out regular dividends and remain profitable due to their proven business models. Companies that tend to reward investors with a high dividend payout outperform non-dividend-paying stocks in a highly volatile market.\n\nOn that note, let us look at companies like H. B.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly in evening deals on Thursday as a broad rotation out of heavyweight technology stocks appeared to have eased before a string of key earnings from the sector next week.\n\nBut sentiment still remained fragile following underwhelming earnings from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), while uncertainty over U.S. politics also weighed amid growing calls for President Joe Biden to withdraw his reelection bid.\n\nS&P 500 Futuresrose 0.1% to 5,602.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,946.50 points by 19:47 ET (23:47 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose slightly to 40,985.0 points.\n\nTech stocks steady after bruising losses\n\nMajor technology stocks steadied in aftermarket trading, after clocking steep losses over the past two sessions. Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose slightly in evening trade.\n\nA mix of profit-taking and a rotation into sectors more primed to benefit from an economic recovery had battered major technology stocks over the past two sessions.\n\nNetflix fell slightly in aftermarket trade after its second quarter earnings missed expectations.\n\nHeavyweight chipmaking stocks were also rattled by the prospect of more U.S. sanctions on China, especially on the country\u2019s chipmaking sector.\n\nLosses in tech sparked deep losses on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 down 0.8% at 5,544.59 points on Thursday. The NASDAQ Composite fell 0.7% to 17,874.45 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.3% to 17,874.45 points.\n\nHeavyweight tech earnings on tap, TSMC supports chipmakers\n\nFocus was now squarely on key upcoming earnings from the tech sector next week. Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)are all set to report on Tuesday, with the two internet giants set to offer more cues on artificial intelligence after a massive valuation spike over the past year.\n\nTesla will be watched for how the electric car maker is navigating a steep decline in sales this year.\n\nPositive earnings from chipmaking bellwethers ASML (AS:ASML) Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) aided chipmaking stocks on Thursday. TSMC rose slightly after it clocked stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, with the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker also hiking its outlook on strong AI-fueled demand.\n\nPolitical wrangling in focus as calls grow for Biden to exit race\n\nThe 2024 presidential race was also a point of focus for Wall Street, amid growing calls from members of the Democratic party for Biden to not seek re-election.\n\nReports on Thursday said former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi had told House democrats that Biden could be persuaded to exit the race.\n\nStory continues\n\nConcerns over Biden\u2019s health, coupled with the increasing popularity of Republican nominee Donald Trump, have sparked doubts over whether Biden will be able to clinch a second term.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; major earnings awaited\n\nEmbraer deliveries rise 88% in second quarter, order backlog at 7-year high\n\nFired Citigroup banker says COO intended to deceive regulator on bank's metrics\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget the Metaverse! 7 Real-World Tech Stocks Poised for Breakout.",
        "content": "The technology sector offers growth that few other sectors can match. Some of that growth is rooted in utilitarian, real-world innovation. Conversely, other niches within the tech sector grow due to the promise inherent to undeveloped, future technology. The metaverse is an excellent recent example of the latter. However, it remains very risky, and I believe that investors should focus on real-world tech stocks instead.\n\nWhen I say real world, I mean firms currently selling utilitarian technology.\u00a0 That means the things we see and use regularly, not vague promises like those from the metaverse.\n\nFortunately, there are many options within the highly developed tech sector. The more real-world innovation these companies bring to market, the more valuable their stocks should become. Sure, investing in undeveloped future technology sometimes yields massive returns. That said, the utilitarian route is safer and still offers very strong returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has returned even though iPhone sales remain problematic. By now, investors know the reason: Apple is rolling out its AI, which will be heavily applied to iPhones. The application of AI there, too, has reignited interest in the stock, sending it substantially higher over the past few months.\n\nWhile Apple\u2019s shares are currently fully priced, I think investors will continue to invest regardless. In 2024, the markets will continue to look for news to substantiate optimism, justified or not.\n\nI believe the rollout of the application of generative AI is a justifiable reason to invest in Apple even now. Apple intends to ship 10% more iPhones in the second half of 2024. The company plans to ship 90 million iPhone 16 devices during the period. The application of AI features in those phones is anticipated to drive a 10% rise in sales above iPhone 15 devices. iPhone sales are the main driver of Apple\u2019s success. They continue to\u00a0fall,\u00a0so a rebound, measured by actual numbers and not just hype, should send share prices higher.\n\nGrab Holdings (GRAB) A group of Grab riders on motorbikes in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSource: Twinsterphoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrab Holdings (NASDAQ:GRAB) is a real-world tech stock that continues to be poised for a breakout. Several reasons, both internal and external, lead investors to continue to hold that belief.\n\nInternally, investors must spend a few minutes reviewing the company\u2019s financial statements. Those who do will see a company that continues growing rapidly on the top line while approaching net profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company continues rapidly improving its operating losses, leading management to adjust its guidance upward.\n\nExternally, investors should note that the rideshare super app serves a Southeast Asia region that is growing rapidly. GDP in the region is expected to increase by 4.6% in 2024. The region is characterized by favorable demographics and massive opportunities due to shifting global supply chains. Those factors supercharge the potential of companies, including Grab Holdings.\n\nGrab Holdings is an excellent example of how real-world technology can be applied to create utilitarian innovation and tangible results.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) STMicroelectronics building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nDepending upon where you look, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) is expected to break out strongly or very strongly.\n\nThe consensus is that the European chip maker is expected to increase value by roughly 20%. However, others, including Morningstar, expect that STMicroelectronics has closer to\u00a050% upside.\n\nThe push for safer, greener, smarter vehicles leads to increased electronic content across the automotive sector. STMicroelectronics is a notable competitor in the automotive sector. The company has significant opportunities in the microcontroller and silicon carbide based power product spaces.\n\nSilicon carbide (SiC) has unique properties that are highly utilitarian in power products. SiC components can withstand voltages up to 10 times higher than traditional silicon components. They also conduct heat better than silicon components. The technical advantages go on and on, and if STMicroelectronics competes strongly in that arena, it will thrive.\n\nThe three most recent analyst actions related to STMicroelectronics include two upgrades and the reiteration of a buy rating.\n\nEHang Holdings (EH) Flying taxi or Car-drone-EHang 216 exhibited by Prestige Image Motor Cars at the 2023 Indonesia International Motor Show (IIMS) at JIExpo Kemayoran. EH stock\n\nSource: Toto Santiko Budi / Shutterstock.com\n\nEHang Holdings (NYSE:EH) is the world\u2019s most advanced flying car company.\u00a0 The Chinese company commercialized electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology far ahead of its U.S. competitors.\n\nEHang Holdings\u2019 U.S. competitors continue to work through regulatory hurdles and are expected to commercialize sometime in 2025. Meanwhile, EHang Holdings has been delivering vehicles for some time. The company delivered 27 eVTOLs\u00a0in late June\u00a0to Wenchang County Transportation Group in Zhejiang Province. The vehicles are being used in tourism, and EHang Holdings is seeing success.\n\nThe company delivered 26 eVTOLs during the first quarter, substantially more than the 11 vehicles delivered a year prior. EHang Holdings\u2019s more than year of vehicle delivery experience should give investors some idea of how it compares with U.S. flying car firms and stoke interest due to the real-world results the deliveries exemplify.\n\nRevenues are booming at the company, while net losses continue to narrow. I believe EHang Holdings\u2019s early lead over its U.S. competitors, combined with improving financials, poises the stock for a breakout.\n\nLam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a highly utilitarian tech stock that is poised for a breakout.\n\nThe company produces semiconductor fabrication equipment to produce the integrated circuits necessary for artificial intelligence. So, it\u2019s a part of the AI opportunity. The company is also building facilities near its global customers\u2019 research hubs.\n\nWhile the company is preparing for the continued emergence of AI, its results are also attractive. Earnings increased by 11.4% in the first quarter on better-than-anticipated revenues. Sales have grown by more than 20% over the last three years, while earnings during the same period increased by more than 30%.\n\nThe company announced a\u00a0share buyback roughly two months ago, which is indicative of the company\u2019s commitment to shareholders.\n\nMany investors looking for AI equipment producers will initially land on ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) as the best choice. Lam Research is not to be overlooked in that regard.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a major player in cybersecurity. Its core offerings focus on protecting computer systems from cyberattacks, with a particular emphasis on security solutions designed for the cloud environment, which offer scalability and flexibility. The advent of AI has upped the stakes in the cyber security world, positioning Crowdstrike stock for a breakout.\n\nTo be fair, Crowdstrike has already broken out in 2024 increasing in price by more than 47%. Even so, share prices remain slightly below consensus target prices.\n\nJudging the tech sector is particularly difficult concerning AI. Software stocks,\u00a0including Crowdstrike, recently saw a spike in demand as the markets rotated out of chip stocks and into software. It currently appears that FOMO surrounding chip stocks is suddenly high again.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the two AI subsectors can rise together in the coming weeks. Regardless, Crowdstrike is undergoing substantial earnings growth in 2024. That alone is a strong reason to expect it to break out further.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) Slim Margins Are a Real and Continuing Problem for CSCO Stock\n\nSource: Anucha Cheechang / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock represents a combination of stability and broad tech exposure that is highly utilitarian. The company sells networking hardware and includes a dividend that yields 3.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is shifting toward a greater percentage of software sales overall. Software sales are associated with repeat purchases, whereas hardware sales tend to be one-and-done. The result is a much more advantageous sales cycle. Beyond that, software sales are associated with greater margins than hardware sales.\n\nCisco Systems is positioned to capitalize on the LoRa and Lo RaWAN opportunities. That said, Cisco Systems stock is down by more than 7% in 2024. In my mind it\u2019s poised for a breakout due to all of the factors I just mentioned. EPS is expected to grow by more than 23% this year at the company.\n\nHowever, Cisco Systems also anticipates that the top line will contract by a few percentage points. I look at it this way: The company will continue to have the earnings to pay a healthy dividend based on EPS projections. So, buy Cisco Systems for that while also remaining optimistic as are many analysts who expect shares could rise as high as $76, well beyond their current price of $46.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Leading foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\u2019s shares tumbled as much as 4.3% Thursday, while Korean memory maker Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s dipped as much as 3.3%.\n\nThe declines mirrored losses in global peers overnight after news that the Biden administration has told allies it\u2019s considering more severe trade restrictions if companies such as Tokyo Electron and Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV continue giving China access to advanced chip technology.\n\nThe losses also follow recent underperformance by global tech stocks amid signs of a rotation away from what have been the market\u2019s biggest drivers over the past year. The Bloomberg Asia Pacific Semiconductors Index is still up more than 30% this year even with a drop of about 5% this week.\n\n\u201cThe broad share price impact suggests that this is more to do with market sentiment rather than real fundamental concerns,\u201d and incremental tightening should not have a material impact given that trade restrictions have been an ongoing issue, said Billy Leung, an investment strategist at Global X Management Co. \u201cThis could be opportunistic for investors to take profit on a sector that has hugely outperformed,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the news of potentially stricter curbs comes amid heightening geopolitical concerns.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Thursday, with losses centered around technology and chipmaking shares as the threat of more U.S. restrictions on China ramped up concerns over a renewed trade war between the countries.\n\nRecent comments by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on U.S. defense spending on Taiwan also kept sentiment towards regional markets on edge.\n\nAsian stocks markets a weak lead-in from Wall Street, where the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite plummeted on selling in chip and technology stocks. The sectors were also hit with extended profit-taking, as optimism over interest rate cuts saw investors pivot into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nU.S. stock index futures rose in Asian trade, recovering slightly from Wednesday\u2019s losses.\n\nAsian chip, tech stocks slide on concerns over US-China trade\n\nTech-heavy indexes were the worst performers in Asia on Thursday, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 tumbling 2.1% on losses in chipmaking stocks. Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO:8035), the country\u2019s most valuable chipmaker, slid over 8% after a Bloomberg report suggested the company could face more U.S. scrutiny over its supplying to Chinese markets.\n\nThe Bloomberg report said that the U.S. is considering stricter trade restrictions on China if companies including Tokyo Electron and ASML Holding NV ADR (NASDAQ:ASML) continue supplying chip technology to China.\n\nSuch a move could represent continued efforts by the Biden administration to cut China off from advancements in artificial intelligence. It could also draw severe retaliatory measures from Beijing, sparking a renewed trade war between the world\u2019s biggest economies.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI slid 1.4%, while worsening sentiment towards China saw the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and the Shanghai Composite lose 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.

Australia\u2019s ASX 200 fell 0.3%, retreating from record highs as a substantially stronger-than-expected reading on the labor market pushed up concerns over higher interest rates in the country.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a weak open, with worsening sentiment towards Asia setting up Indian stocks for some profit-taking from record highs.\n\nStill, several regional markets were still trading near record highs, having advanced on growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by as soon as September.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks sink as US-China trade tensions spark technology rout\n\nTSMC is set to report a strong profit but Trump comments pummel its stock\n\nBYD to introduce three more car models to Vietnam market\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Wednesday, steadying after a rout in chipmaking stocks, on concerns over more trade disruptions, sparked steep losses on Wall Street.\n\nGrowing bets on early interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve also spurred a broader pivot away from technology stocks and into more growth-sensitive sectors. This saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average surge to record highs even as its Wall Street peers lagged.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,652.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 20,067.0 points by 20:43 ET (00:43 GMT).

Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also steadied after falling during the session.\n\nReports that the Biden administration was considering more export curbs on China, particularly in chipmaking technology, battered the sector, given that it could herald lower sales in China, which is a major consumer of chips.\n\nConcerns over heightened geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan dented chip stocks, after Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump said Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies.\n\nTech stocks were also pressured by a broader shift into more economically sensitive sectors, amid growing bets that the Fed will begin cutting rates from September.\n\nThis saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 0.6% to a record high of 41,198.08 points. The S&P 500 fell 1.4% to 5,588.27 points, while the NASDAQ Composite finished down 2.8% at 17,997.81 points.\n\nNetflix, TSMC earnings awaited\n\nFocus remained on the second quarter earnings season, with technology majors Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and TSMC set to report earnings on Thursday.\n\nTSMC is considered a bellwether for the chipmaking industry, and is expected to log a bumper second quarter profit on increased demand from the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nLithographic equipment maker ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML), which is also considered a bellwether for the chip industry, clocked stronger than expected second quarter earnings, as it flagged increased demand from the AI industry.\n\nEarnings from Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX), Alaska Air Group Inc (NYSE:ALK) and Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) are also due on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as chip rout eases; more earnings awaited\n\nAustralia's Domino's Pizza slumps to over 9-year low on bleak store growth view\n\nInsurance broker TWFG prices US IPO above range to raise about $187 million\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Chip stocks Nvidia (NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), and ASML (ASML) have all soared this year thanks to investor bets on the artificial intelligence boom. On Wednesday, their momentum came to a screeching halt.\n\nThe three stocks ended the session near session lows for reasons ranging from investor concern over export restrictions to a broader rotation out of tech stocks.\n\nOne headwind that emerged was the potential for tighter restrictions on exports of semiconductor technology to China.\n\nBloomberg reported the Biden administration is considering implementing a more severe curb involving controls on foreign-manufactured products that use even the smallest amount of American technology. Chip related stocks fell on Wednesday amid major geopolitical headwinds. Chip stocks were getting hammered on Wednesday amid major headwinds\n\nCurrent restrictions have already impacted US-based companies\u2019 ability to sell to China. Nvidia sales to China decreased as a percentage of total data center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\n\nASML stock saw the steepest decline on Wednesday, falling 12%. Shares of the Netherlands-based chip equipment maker were also pressured following its third quarter guidance.\n\nWhile ASML beat its second quarter top- and bottom-line expectations, its revenue forecast for the current quarter came in shy of the consensus analyst estimate.\n\nThe company also said it expects quarterly gross margin in the range of 50% to 51% versus Wall Street expectations of 51.1%. Exterior view of one of the buildings in the ASML complex in Veldhoven, Netherlands, Monday, Jan. 30, 2023. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAlso dragging down chip stocks were comments from former president Donald Trump, who said Taiwan \"should pay\" the US for protection against any aggression from China.\n\n\u201cYou know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything,\u201d Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek in an interview published on Tuesday.\n\nHe also said Taiwan took \"about 100%\" of the US chip business.\n\nTrump's comments sent shares of chip manufacturing and design giant TSMC plummeting more than 7% on Wednesday.\n\nMany chipmakers, including Nvidia, depend on Taiwan for manufacturing. The island located east of China is a major semiconductor hub with roughly 92% of the world\u2019s most advanced chipmaking capacity, according to the US International Trade Commission.\n\nIt's worth noting shares of semiconductor companies Intel (INTC) and GlobalFoundries (GFS) were up during the session. Both companies are seen beneficiaries of the Biden administration's push to onshore chip production to the US.\n\nThe semis sell-off comes as investors have recently rotated out of big-cap names into small-cap stocks.\n\nThe rotation out technology began last week after the latest inflation print gave investors more optimism that the Federal Reserve would start cutting rates in September.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Russell 2000 (^RUT) outperformed large-cap stocks on the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) over a five-session streak.\n\nOn Wednesday the small-cap index fell roughly 1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped almost 3%.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) reported a better-than-expected quarter, but the results were overshadowed by increasing geopolitical concerns.\n\nShares of the Dutch tech company traded down 10% as of 10:30 ET on reports the United States is considering tighter restrictions on tech sales to China.\n\nStrong quarter, tough questions\n\nASML makes the machines that make semiconductor chips, providing the technology that makes tech trends including artificial intelligence possible. The company reported second-quarter net profit of 1.58 billion euros on net sales of 6.24 billion euros, topping the 1.43 billion-euro profit on sales of 6.03 billion euros that analysts had expected.\n\nNet bookings totaled 5.6 billion euros, up 24% from a year ago, and ASML generated a 51.5% gross margin.\n\n\"In line with previous quarters, overall semiconductor inventory levels continue to improve,\" CEO Christophe Fouquet said in a statement. \"While there are still uncertainties in the market, primarily driven by the macro environment, we expect industry recovery to continue in the second half of the year.\"\n\nBut investors were more focused on a report that the Biden administration has told allies it is considering drastic steps to crack down on ASML technology going to China. The U.S. government is considering restricting ASML's ability to service and repair systems already operating in China, putting ASML and other foreign companies on a equal footing to U.S. companies.\n\nIs ASML stock a buy?\n\nThe geopolitical risk is real and unlikely to go away until at least after the U.S. election. Investors need to be braced for volatility and headline risk in the months to come.\n\nBut for long-term-focused investors, there's a lot to like about ASML. The company is the only source of the massive machines necessary to make the smallest and most powerful chips, giving it a powerful competitive position. The focus on China could also help stimulate future sales as semiconductor manufacturers look to diversify their geographical footprint away from Taiwan.\n\nASML is a stock that nearly never goes on sale, and even after the Wednesday decline, the shares still trade at 48 times earnings.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street is looking beyond the obvious megacap stocks to find the next leg of the artificial intelligence trade.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Floats Tougher Trade Rules to Rein In China Chip Industry Nasdaq 100 Set for Worst Day Since December 2022: Markets Wrap BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Security Tightened on Iran Plot Intel; No Link to Shooting Amazon Sold a Used Diaper. It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business\n\nBetting that the Magnificent Seven may be running out of steam after an 18-month rally, some investors are turning their attention to what Melius Research dubbed \u201cAI laggards.\u201d This group, which includes Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and International Business Machines Corp., have exposure to the AI theme but failed to keep up with gains for the biggest AI winners in the first half of the year.\n\nAll three have outperformed over the past month, while AI poster child Nvidia Corp. has slightly dropped in that period. Chip stocks broadly fell Wednesday after Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration is considering using the most severe trade restrictions available if companies continue giving China access to advanced chip technology, although Intel rose 6.6%.\n\nIBM shares swung between gains and losses in early trading Wednesday, after five days of gains.\n\nCrucially, the laggards also have lower valuations and bars to clear in terms of sentiment and earnings expectations, suggesting they could be well positioned for the rest of 2024.\n\n\u201cWe are believers in a \u2018catch-up\u2019 trade for some in semis, hardware and even software \u2014 those with lower expectations,\u201d Melius analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note this month, adding that a similar pattern occurred in 2023, when first half \u201cunderdogs\u201d did well in the second half.\n\nReitzes also included Apple Inc. on his list of stocks that underperformed in the first six months. Shares in the iPhone maker have been rising steadily since April, preceding the rotation into other laggards, but have been especially strong since Apple demonstrated long-awaited new AI features last month.\n\nTed Mortonson, a technology desk sector strategist at Baird, said investors are starting to rotate into stocks where fundamentals are strong but expectations are lower, leaving more room for upside.\n\n\u201cThe obvious AI stocks have doubled over the past year and are facing slower growth from here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to think they\u2019re over-owned and that there might be a catch up in names that have been overlooked.\u201d\n\nMortonson highlighted other stocks he sees as beneficiaries of the trade, including software company F5 Inc., electronic measurement instruments company Keysight Technologies Inc., and semiconductor-related firms Diodes Inc., Coherent Corp., Lumentum Holdings Inc. and Aehr Test Systems, which on Tuesday gave a positive outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rotation is coming after a first half which saw megacaps including Nvidia, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. propel the market higher, stretching valuations for these names and leaving them with a tougher setup for the rest of 2024. Citigroup analysts recently suggested investors take profits in some high-flying AI stocks and \u201cre-balance toward a broader array of AI stocks across the value chain.\u201d\n\nEarnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to decelerate next year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. At the same time, AI winners like Nvidia and Microsoft are trading at substantial premiums to their long-term multiples \u2014 making laggards like IBM and Intel look like bargains in comparison.\n\nIBM\u2019s second-quarter results next week will be an important datapoint to determine whether this trade can continue. Last quarter, weak sales from the company\u2019s consulting unit sparked the biggest one-day drop in more than two years. While megacap stocks have been hitting record after record this year, IBM hasn\u2019t hit one since 2013.\n\n\u201cEveryone owns the growth tech stocks, but the value side has been neglected at a time when the macro cycle should be pretty favorable,\u201d said Ohsung Kwon, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a trade to be made within tech, since positioning has gotten pretty extreme.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe recent strength in small-cap stocks includes tech, with the category trouncing its larger equivalent of late. An index tracking small-cap tech jumped 3% on Tuesday, its biggest one-day gain since December, even as the large-cap tech index fell 0.4%. While large-cap remains the decisive outperformer this year, the past month has favored smaller names. The small-cap tech index is up more than 10%, compared with a 3.8% rise for large-caps.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nThe Biden administration, facing pushback to its chip crackdown on China, has told allies that it\u2019s considering using the most severe trade restrictions available if companies such as Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV continue giving the country access to advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nASML shares fell as the prospect of more severe US restrictions on its business in China offset growth in the Dutch firm\u2019s order intake last quarter. Elon Musk said he will relocate the headquarters for X and SpaceX to Texas, adding more fuel to the billionaire\u2019s efforts to align himself with the political right and distance himself from left-leaning California. Tesla Inc. forming an autonomous taxi platform will be the catalyst for a roughly 10-fold increase in its share price, Ark Investment Management LLC\u2019s Cathie Wood said, echoing years of bullish predictions about a business the carmaker has yet to stand up. Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s marketing portal for merchants crashed Tuesday night, according to multiple Amazon sellers and consultants, fouling up one of the online retailer\u2019s biggest sales of the year. GitLab Inc., a US software developer backed by Google parent Alphabet Inc., is exploring a sale after attracting interest from potential bidders, Reuters reported.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "This chipmaker's results this week are critical for the semi sector: analysts",
        "content": "A Mizuho analyst stated that the semiconductor sector faces a critical test this week, with the upcoming developments likely to shape its future trajectory.\n\nThe investment bank highlighted several factors, which could potentially impact companies like ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML), Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO:8035), BE Semiconductor Industries NV (AS:BESI), ASM International NV (AS:ASMI), and others.\n\nFirstly, Mizuho\u2019s report points out that the U.S. government is considering further restrictions on semiconductor equipment sales to China. This includes non-U.S.-made tools from companies such as ASML and Tokyo Electron.\n\n\u201cUS government wants to do anything and everything they can to hurt China domestic advanced semi manufacturing and evolution,\u201d the analyst said.\n\n\u201cNo talk of lagging edge equipment restrictions or further export bans for US semi-cap equipment suppliers. This looks and feels like Biden wanting to look tougher against China into election and the DNC next month,\u201d they added.\n\nThe restrictions would likely affect ASML significantly, especially given that 49% of their Q2 revenues came from China, albeit not from their EUV equipment.\n\nASML's recent earnings report, while showing strong Q2 results, provided underwhelming guidance for Q3. Despite beating Q2 expectations, the Q3 outlook fell short, largely due to revenue recognition timing.\n\n\"ASML reiterated the prior CY24 and CY25 revenue guides, so the weaker Q3 is pure revenue recognition timing,\u201d the analyst noted. The press on tighter U.S. restrictions into China for semiconductors has overshadowed these results, contributing to a sell-off in the sector.\n\nMoreover, Mizuho reflected on former President Donald Trump's recent comments in a Businessweek interview, which raised concerns about U.S. defense commitments to Taiwan. Trump suggested that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for its defense, a statement that rekindled investor fears regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and the broader geopolitical tensions.\n\n\u201cAll this does is raise past concerns amongst investors on TSM from China invasion or disruption risk. These concerns were high in 2023, but faded as AI strength and growth has over-shadowed all this geo-political risk,\u201d Mizuho\u2019s analyst commented.\n\n\u201cI think Trump forgets that anything happens to TSM in Taiwan and no one gets a new iPhone or Macbook and new Samsung (KS:005930) / Android handsets also sort of disappear. Might anger the US electorate a bit, right. And US cloud companies get no GPUs or AI silicon either.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the flip side, the analyst also highlighted the potential beneficiaries of the U.S. restricting semiconductor equipment sales to China, most notably Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) as possible \"winners.\" Despite this, they retain a cautious stance on these names.\n\n\u201cI am not a buyer of either really on any of this, especially INTC. MU [Micron] heavily US based, but down 4% as part of the AI semi unwind.\u201d\n\nOverall, Mizuho stressed that all of the aforementioned factors place a lot more emphasis on how TSMC\u2019s upcoming earnings results and guidance. More importantly, the manufacturer\u2019s commentary on AI, broader foundry market trends, pricing trends, capital expenditure, and non-AI order trends, will be essential.\n\n\u201cHow TSM stock trades tomorrow will be critical for the next move in semi sector,\u201d the analyst emphasized. \u201cAnything negative or worrisome accelerates the de-risk trade in my view.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd to be honest, the de-risk trade in semis could be much more a factor rotation out of Tech winners YTD and into rate-sensitive laggards.\u201d\n\nThe weakness in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is particularly telling, as all checks on their fundamentals remain strong, yet the stock has been grinding lower on days when non-tech sectors rally.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChipmaker's results this week are critical for the semi sector: analysts\n\nUS online sales hit $7.2 billion on first day of Amazon Prime Day event, Adobe says\n\nNetflix's efforts to grow ad tier in focus as subscriber growth slows\n\nView comments",

        "content": "ASML (ASML)\n\nShares in ASML dropped over 7% in pre-market trading as the the prospect of more severe US restrictions on its business in China overshadowed better-than-expected second-quarter earnings.\n\nThe Dutch group, which supplies semiconductor-making machinery to chip makers, booked \u20ac5.57bn ($6.07bn, \u00a34.67bn) in orders in the three months to the end of June, up from \u20ac4.50bn a year earlier. Analysts had forecast nearly \u20ac5.04bn in orders, according to consensus estimates by Visible Alpha.\n\nNet sales fell 9.5% year-on-year, while net income dropped by 18.7%.\n\n\u201cWhile there are still uncertainties in the market, primarily driven by the macro environment, we expect industry recovery to continue in the second half of the year,\u201d ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said in a statement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: Interest rate cut in doubt even as UK inflation remains at Bank of England target\n\nShares dropped after Bloomberg reported that the US is telling allies, including the Netherlands, it may take unilateral action to restrict exports of chip equipment to China if they fail to do so themselves.\n\nCharles Schwab (SCHW)\n\nCharles Schwab plunged over 10% in Tuesday's session and was in the red during pre-market trading after the investing giant warned it will have to shrink itself in order to protect profits.\n\nCharles Schwab reported slightly better than expected second-quarter earnings and revenue early Tuesday. The financial services firm ended the quarter with total client assets of $9.4tn.\n\nQ2 revenue increased by less than 1% to $4.69bn with earnings of 73 cents per share, down around 3% compared to Q2 2023.\n\nNet flows into managed investing solutions reached $25bn, up 56% over the year-to-date compared with the first six months of 2023.\n\n\"Client interest in our broad array of wealth solutions remained strong through June. Year-to-date enrolments are up [around] 30% versus the prior year period,\" said co-chairman and chief executive Walt Bettinger.\n\nSchwab management revealed in a post-earnings conference call that it is shrinking its banking business to \"protect the economics we're able to generate from owning a bank.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nShopify (SHOP)\n\nShopify was in the red ahead of the opening bell after surging over 8% in Tuesday's session following an upgrade from Bank of America (BoA).\n\nBoA raised its rating on the e-commerce platform to \"Buy\" from \"Neutral\" and increased its price target to $82 from $78. Analysts believe Shopify's revenue growth alongside its disciplined approach to spending will create improved margin growth in the coming quarters.\n\n\"Following years of declining margin, we believe that the company has turned a corner on balanced growth and margin, under new CFO Jeff Hoffmeister,\" BoA analyst Brad Sills said in a report.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Pound breaks $1.30 for first time in a year while European stocks fall on UK inflation data\n\n\"Revenue growth and disciplined spending point to healthy margin expansion going forward.

They did take about 100% of our chip business. I think, Taiwan should pay us for defence,\" Trump said in interview on 25 June that was published on Tuesday.\n\n\"You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything.\"\n\nTaiwan premier Cho Jung-tai, responding to Trump's comments, said Taiwan and the US have good relations despite the lack of formal ties, and is dedicated to bolstering its own defences.\n\n\"Taiwan has steadily strengthened its defence budget and demonstrated its responsibility to the international community,\" he told reporters in Taipei, according to Reuters.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV fell as the prospect of more severe US restrictions on its business in China offset growth in the Dutch firm\u2019s order intake last quarter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Security Tightened on Iran Plot Intel; No Link to Shooting Amazon Sold a Used Diaper. It Tanked a Mom-and-Pop Business From Elon Musk to David Sacks, Silicon Valley\u2019s Trump Backers Cheer Vance as VP Pick Ambani's $600 Million Wedding Is Just Business as Usual\n\nThe Biden administration is considering using the most severe trade restrictions available if companies including ASML continue to give China access to advanced semiconductor technology, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday before the company published its second quarter results.\n\nThe US is targeting ASML, which has a monopoly on making the machines that produce the most advanced semiconductors, as it ratchets up pressure to stem Chinese advances in the semiconductor industry. Shares fell even as the company reported that bookings rose 54% in the second quarter from the previous three months to \u20ac5.57 billion ($6.1 billion), beating estimates.\n\n\u201cThe geopolitical angle, however, is likely to be in more focus today than results, with Bloomberg reporting the US is pressing for additional restrictions on ASML,\u201d Citi analyst Andrew Gardiner said in a note. \u201cPressure is building to restrict service activity on the installed base.\u201d\n\nASML shares dropped as much as 7.7% to \u20ac903 in Amsterdam, the most since October 2022.\n\nASML sees sales in the current quarter between \u20ac6.7 billion and \u20ac7.3 billion, missing estimates of \u20ac7.5 billion. The company confirmed previous guidance of flat sales this year before returning to strong growth in 2025.\n\nPrevious US-led chip measures targeting ASML\u2019s exports to China did not dent demand from the Asian nation. China accounted for nearly half of ASML\u2019s revenue in the second quarter, and sales in the country rose by 21% from the previous period. Beijing has been buying up unrestricted older kit to make more mature types of semiconductors.\n\nASML is increasingly driven by demand for high-powered chips needed for AI applications.\n\n\u201cWe currently see strong developments in AI, driving most of the industry recovery and growth, ahead of other market segments,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Christophe Fouquet said in the statement.\n\nImpressive results from some of ASML\u2019s biggest customers helped support demand for the company\u2019s equipment. Last week, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said second-quarter sales grew at their fastest pace since 2022, buoyed by the AI boom that\u2019s fueling data center investment worldwide. Sales to Taiwan rose by \u20ac290 million in the quarter as demand for advanced equipment also inched up.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter was ASML\u2019s first under Fouquet, who took over when Peter Wennink retired in April. He has been trying to balance a US push to tighten export controls for China with the need to continue to sell gear in the company\u2019s biggest market.\n\nUS pressure to slow Beijing\u2019s advances in making semiconductors led the Netherlands to ban exports to China of ASML\u2019s second-most advanced category of machinery, immersion DUV lithography machines, at the start of the year.\n\nHowever, ASML continues to service machines that were bought before the restrictions were in place. The Biden administration has told allies that it\u2019s considering using the foreign direct product rule, which lets the US impose controls on foreign-made products that use even the tiniest amount of American technology, if such practices continue, according to the Bloomberg report.\n\nThe company has said as much as 15% of China sales this year will be affected by the export control rules imposed in January. ASML has never been allowed to sell its most-advanced extreme ultraviolet technology to China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support How Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Shares of major Asian chipmaking stocks fell on Wednesday amid some profit-taking as investors hunkered down before earnings reports from two key players in the industry- ASML and TSMC.\n\nDutch lithographic equipment maker ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) (NASDAQ:ASML)- the first of the two to report, clocked stronger-than-expected net bookings in the second quarter, as robust demand from the artificial intelligence industry saw increased demand for lithographic equipment.\n\nStrong earnings from ASML bode well for the chipmaking industry. It, along with Taiwan's TSMC, are considered bellwethers for the industry.\n\nTSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM)- the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker, will report earnings on Thursday. Monthly data showed the company clocked a much higher-than-expected revenue in the second quarter, and is forecast to see a strong quarterly profit on sustained demand from AI.\n\nChipmaking stocks in Japan, China and South Korea fell across the board, as investors awaited more cues on chip demand, especially from the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nThe sector was also hit with some profit-taking after hype over AI drove a major melt-up in valuation over the past year. Sentiment was also soured by comments from U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies.\n\nAny instability in Taiwan, which is a key part of the global chipmaking industry through TSMC, presents headwinds for the industry. TSMC fell about 2% in Taiwan trade.\n\nIn Japan, Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO:8035)- the country\u2019s most valuable chipmaker- slid 7.5%, while Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857) and Renesas Electronics Corp (TYO:6723) shed 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively.\n\nSouth Korean memory chip maker SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) fell 4.3%, while peer Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) lost 0.8%.\n\nIn China, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981)- the country\u2019s biggest chipmaker- fell about 1%.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian chipmaking stocks dip with TSMC, ASML earnings in focus\n\nExclusive-PwC weighs halving of China financial services audit staff, say sources\n\nHSBC appoints insider Georges Elhedery as CEO\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Wednesday, with losses concentrated around Taiwan and China after U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense.\n\nStill, broader losses were limited by a strong lead-in from Wall Street, where the DJI surged nearly 2% to record highs as optimism over lower interest rates saw traders pivot into more economically sensitive sectors and out of technology.\n\nU.S. stock index futures fell slightly in Asian trade.\n\nTaiwan, China stocks sink after Trump comments\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Taiwan Weighted index fell 0.3%, while China\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng lost 0.2%.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Trump said that he believed Taiwan should pay the U.S. for supplying the island with defense equipment, on the grounds that Taiwan does not give the U.S. anything.\n\n\u201cI know the people very well, respect them greatly. They did take about 100% of our chip business. I think, Taiwan should pay us for defense,\u201d Trump said in the interview, adding that the U.S. was no different than an insurance company.\n\nRelations between Taiwan and China are a sensitive topic, given that Beijing has constantly called for the reunification of Taiwan and the mainland. The U.S. is the island\u2019s biggest defense supplier, but has no formal diplomatic agreement with Taipei.\n\nConcerns over a Trump presidency had also rattled Chinese markets in recent sessions, given that the former president has maintained a strong rhetoric against the country. His administration had sparked a trade war with Beijing in the late-2010s.\n\nChinese markets were also nursing losses from a swathe of weak economic readings from the country.\n\nTech stocks dip with key earnings on tap\n\nAsian tech stocks, particularly chipmakers, retreated on Wednesday, as expectations of interest rate cuts drove flows into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nMajor chipmaking stocks were also on edge before key earnings from the sector this week, namely ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML) and TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM), who will report earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nBoth are considered as bellwethers for chip demand, which rose sharply over the past year amid increased interest in artificial intelligence.\n\nTSMC fell about 2% following Trump\u2019s comments on Taiwan.\n\nLosses in chipmakers saw Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rise only 0.2%, while South Korea\u2019s KOSPI lost 0.2%.\n\nOther Asian indexes- specifically those with lower weightage in tech- advanced on the prospect of interest rate cuts. Japan\u2019s TOPIX index added 0.5%, while Australia\u2019s ASX 200 surged 1% to a record high.\n\nStory continues\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a positive open, as the index and the BSE Sensex 30 continued to notch record highs on persistent optimism over India\u2019s economy.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks dip on tech losses, Trump comments rattle Taiwan, China markets\n\nUS considering tougher trade rules in chip crackdown on China, Bloomberg News reports\n\nTrump says Taiwan should pay for defence, sending TSMC stock down\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Just Loaded Up on Stocks: 6 Companies She Just Bought",
        "content": "Between fundraising, legislating, and engaging in a number of other responsibilities, the politicians who serve in Washington, D.C., are busy. Many of them, however, find enough time to buy and sell stocks. And because many politicians demonstrate an uncanny ability to outperform the market, ordinary investors are keen to know the stock trades of senators and representatives.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia who sits on the Oversight and Reform Committee and the Homeland Security Committee, recently submitted regulatory filings that acknowledged six recent stock purchases in late June: ASML(NASDAQ: ASML), Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST), CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), Lululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU), Nestle(OTC: NSRGY), and NextEraEnergy(NYSE: NEE). Although the exact value of each transaction wasn't reported, all six trades were valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nThe deets on Greene's newest holdings\n\nAlthough Greene didn't provide any commentary regarding the thinking behind her stock purchases, there are some clear reasons that could've motivated her decision making. Consistent with the market's overwhelming interest in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, two of Greene's recent picks have significant AI exposure. ASML manufactures equipment that semiconductor manufacturers require for making microchips. Encouraging news broke prior to Green's purchase that TaiwanSemiconductorManufacturing would be purchasing ASML's extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machine earlier than expected. Providing sophisticated cloud-based cybersecurity solutions, CrowdStrike helps customers -- with help from AI -- protect various devices such as laptops, mobile devices, and those connected on the Internet of Things. The company recently reported strong results for its fiscal first quarter of 2025, ended April 30, including year-over-year diluted earnings-per-share (EPS) and free-cash-flow increases of 63% and 42%, respectively.\n\nStretching out to the world of retail apparel, Greene scooped up shares of activewear powerhouse Lululemon. Shares of Lululemon had plunged 33% from the start of the year to June 23, the day before Greene clicked the buy button. It's likely that the company's auspicious outlook for 2024 played a pivotal role in her decision-making. In its release of its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2024, ended April 28, management forecast top-line year-over-year growth of 11% to 12% for 2024, and diluted EPS to rise from 17% to 19%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWarehouse club superstar Costco also made its way onto Green's buy list. In early June, Costco reported sales in May had risen 6.4% compared to May 2023. And the growth didn't just occur for one month. The company also noted that revenue in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2024 had climbed 5.4% compared to the same period last year.\n\nEvidently, Greene also recognized a tasty opportunity with Nestle stock. Perhaps it was management's outlook for 2024 -- guidance that it reaffirmed during a business update in April -- that Greene found appetizing. In addition to organic sales rising 4%, management projected EPS growth between 6% and 10% for 2024. Or maybe it was Greene's hunger for passive income that was the source of motivation. Currently, Nestle stock offers a forward dividend yield of 3.1%.\n\nLastly, Greene chose to power her portfolio with NextEra Energy, a renewable energy powerhouse that performed exceptionally well in the first half of 2024. And while the company's future isn't guaranteed, a look at the company's past suggests that it has a history of growth -- a trend that it can certainly extend in the future. Over the past 20 years, for example, NextEra Energy has achieved compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of 9% and 8% for adjusted EPS and operating cash flow, respectively. During the same period, the company maintained focus on rewarding shareholders, hiking its dividend at a 10% CAGR.\n\nShould you make the same buys?\n\nAs savvy investors know, monitoring politicians' stock picks is a smart strategy. Rushing to copy the stock moves that politicians just made, however? Not so much. That being said, ASML and CrowdStrike are two excellent options for tech-focused investors who want to lean into AI and are certainly worth further investigation. Similarly, Lululemon and Costco are two premier consumer-focused companies that can bolster one's portfolio.\n\nNestle, on the other hand, has a history of underperforming the market, and it doesn't seem like there's a catalyst to change that in the near future. For those looking to supplement their passive income, moreover, there are much more compelling options than Nestle. NextEra Energy, for instance, is a compelling dividend stock and with it trading at 11.6 times operating cash flow, a discount to its five-year average cash-flow valuation of 15.8, today seems like an especially good time to take a close look at it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "ASML's order book expected to benefit from AI chip boom",
        "content": "By Toby Sterling and Nathan Vifflin\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ASML, the top equipment supplier to computer chip makers, is expected to report an influx of new orders when its new boss delivers second-quarter results on Wednesday, as customers expand capacity to meet booming demand for AI chips.\n\nAnother focus will be whether Chinese firms have continued heavy purchasing of equipment used to make older generations of chips such as those used in electric cars, a concern for Western policymakers who have curbed buying of more advanced technology.\n\nAnalysts say the company may upgrade guidance as key makers of cutting-edge chips - including Taiwan's TSMC, which manufactures chips for Nvidia and Apple, and reports earnings on Thursday - may increase and accelerate equipment purchases.\n\nASML dominates the market for lithography systems, complex tools that use lasers to help create the tiny circuitry of computer chips. It is the only maker of lithography systems using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths, needed by TSMC to make the most complex chips for smart phones and AI chips.\n\n\"We expect ASML's order received value to reach close to 5 billion euros in the second quarter, higher than consensus estimates\", Mihuzo analyst Kevin Wang said, with strong orders from TSMC of ASML's EUV product line.\n\nThe results are the first under ASML's new CEO Christophe Fouquet, who took over the reins at Europe's biggest tech firm as it navigates the ongoing U.S.-China fight over chips.\n\nASML, worth about 400 billion euros ($437 billion), has described 2024 as a \"transition\" year when business will be flat before rebounding strongly in 2025, driven by demand for its most advanced tools.\n\nShares in the group have risen 45% this year and are trading near record highs above 1,000 euros each, about 40 times forecast 12-month forward earnings, significantly higher than the STOXX Europe 600 tech index.\n\nA growing order book would reassure investors that demand for the company's most advanced products is returning following a weak first half of 2024, in which it relied heavily on orders of older equipment from China.\n\nAnalysts are expecting second-quarter net income of 1.41 billion euros on revenue of 6.04 billion euros, according to the mean estimate from 16 analysts, based on LSEG data.\n\nThat compares with net income of 1.94 billion euros on revenue of 6.90 billion euros in the same period a year ago.\n\nORDER BACKLOG\n\nASML had a 38 billion euro order backlog at the end of the first quarter. That means it needs new orders of 4 billion-6 billion euros each quarter to meet its forecast of 2025 sales at the upper end of a 30 billion-40 billion euro range.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's machines, which cost up to $300 million each, have delivery lead times of 12-18 months, and orders are closely coordinated with customers including Samsung, Intel, and memory specialists SK Hynix and Micron.\n\nFor slightly older generations of chipmaking technology, it competes with Canon and Nikon of Japan. Chinese firms including Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) are attempting to develop competing lithography tools.\n\nBut Chinese chipmakers, who are prevented by U.S.-led export restrictions from obtaining ASML's best tools, have escalated their purchases of older ASML equipment in the past year, representing nearly half of company sales in the first quarter.\n\nChina's rapid increase means lost market share and more competition for non-Chinese firms. The European Commission has begun polling European chip industry firms on whether they feel Chinese state subsidies are distorting markets.\n\nASML argues that world needs older chips, as was shown by shortages during the COVID pandemic, and China is stepping in to supply them.\n\n($1 = 0.9164 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Jan Harvey)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A top Dutch technical university that is a key feeder for ASML Holding NV talent has been caught in the crosshairs of the US-China chip war as Washington seeks to limit Beijing\u2019s ability to produce semiconductors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Shooting Changes Biden\u2019s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign Trump Taps Vance as Running Mate, Picking Populist Protege Trump Classified Documents Case Dismissed by Florida Judge Bold and Bloodied Trump Seizes the Moment After Being Shot\n\n\u201cI always get questions from Americans about Chinese students,\u201d said Robert-Jan Smits, the president of Eindhoven University of Technology, which is located about five miles from ASML\u2019s global headquarters. Last year, the US ambassador to the Netherlands queried him about the large number of students from China, Smits said in a recent interview at his office.\n\nSmits\u2019 comments come as the Netherlands, one of the top sources of machinery and expertise needed to make advanced semiconductors, is facing increasing pressure from Washington to stem Beijing\u2019s chip-making efforts.\n\nIn the intensifying battle over the world\u2019s chip supply chain, the Dutch government is caught between its US ally and a major export market in China. This year, under pressure from its transatlantic partner, The Hague introduced restrictions on exports of ASML\u2019s immersion DUV lithography machines, the company\u2019s second-most capable category of machinery. Before the ban took effect, US officials asked ASML to cancel some previously scheduled shipments to Chinese customers, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nUS Ambassador to the Netherlands Shefali Razdan Duggal declined to comment on her 2023 meeting with Smits.\n\n\u201cWe get the message to be careful with Chinese students but who is giving all kinds of visas to Chinese students to go to American universities? The US government,\u201d Smits said, citing US visa numbers for Chinese students over the past few years.\n\nASML has invested heavily in Eindhoven University of Technology to instruct future employees. In May, the company pledged \u20ac80 million ($87 million) to the university to train PhD students and upgrade the school\u2019s clean room building, which is a dust- and contaminant-free environment needed to study chips. The university has a lab building which houses ASML lithography machines for research purposes.\n\nSmits said his institution works with the government and security services to screen foreign professors and advise faculty on safety measures when visiting China. More than a quarter of the university\u2019s students are international. A spokesperson for Eindhoven University of Technology wasn\u2019t immediately able to say what percentage of students are Chinese nationals.\n\nStory continues\n\nEspionage is becoming a bigger concern as China has made strides in its domestic chip technology. In 2023, ASML \u2014 which is the world\u2019s only producer of advanced lithography machines needed to produce high-end chips used in everything from electric vehicles to military gear \u2014 accused a former China-based employee of stealing confidential information. It launched an internal investigation and tightened security controls after discovering the incident, which may have violated export controls.\n\nLast year, an advanced Chinese-made chip used in a Huawei Technologies Co. debuted despite US efforts to hinder the country\u2019s chip industry. The chip was manufactured using technology from ASML, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nChina \u201cposes the greatest threat to Dutch economic security,\u201d the General Intelligence and Security Service, known by its Dutch initials AIVD, said in its 2023 annual report.\n\nAmid China\u2019s advances, US officials are pushing the Netherlands to stop ASML from servicing and repairing sensitive chip-making equipment that Chinese clients purchased before limits on sales of those devices were put into place.\n\nThe Dutch government under former Prime Minister Mark Rutte resisted those additional steps, wanting more time to evaluate the impact of export bans on high-end chip-making equipment, Bloomberg News reported in April.\n\nThe new government\u2019s position is unclear, although Prime Minister Dick Schoof has signaled a wary approach to China. The Netherlands has to be \u201cvery careful\u201d in talks with Beijing over national security, he told Bloomberg News in an interview this month.\n\nThe government drafted legislation in 2023 to bar Chinese students from university programs that concern sensitive technologies including semiconductors and defense, but it has not been voted on yet.\n\nThe new education minister has given mixed signals on the bill.\n\n\u201cWe do not have the luxury to be naive any longer,\u201d Minister Eppo Bruins said in an interview in The Hague earlier this month. \u201cAt the same time we need a nuanced approach. There are many brilliant Chinese students.\u201d\n\nA professor at Eindhoven University who studies semiconductor technology said it has become increasingly difficult to recruit Chinese students to work on sensitive subjects.\n\nSome Chinese students who were supposed to spend one year at a chip company after completing their exchange at the university were not allowed to work at the firms due to the government-imposed restrictions in recent years, the professor said, asking not to be named discussing sensitive matters.\n\nSmits acknowledges some restrictions are already in place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that we will open the gate to Chinese students,\u201d Smits said. \u201cWe are extremely careful there on who we give access to our top-notch sensitive technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our crown jewels to be stolen,\u201d he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel French Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "ASML Holding N.V. ASML is slated to report second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 17. The upcoming results are expected to reflect ASML\u2019s portfolio strength, growing investments, expanding position in the memory market and increasing design wins.\r\n\r\nHowever, market uncertainties, inflationary pressure, geo-political tensions and the rising cost of technological innovations are likely to have dampened the company\u2019s prospects in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nFor the second quarter, ASML expects revenues between \u20ac5.7 billion and \u20ac6.2 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.35 billion, indicating a fall of 15.6% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.87 per share, which implies a decline of 27.9% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number. The estimate has been unchanged over the past 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nASML Holding has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company\u2019s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 10.21%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ASML Holding this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nASML has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors to Focus on Ahead of Q2 Earnings\n\nThe semiconductor industry has been staging a solid rebound on growing demand and the optimism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). This has been a positive for wafer fab equipment, which, in turn, bodes well for ASML.\r\n\r\nIncreasing adoption of advanced nodes for supporting the build-up of the digital infrastructure, including growth drivers such as 5G, AI and high-performance computing solutions, is expected to have continued bolstering the demand for ASML Holding\u2019s products. As the technology nodes continue to shrink, the demand for the company\u2019s products continues to increase.\r\n\r\nImprovements in lithography tool utilization levels at both logic and memory customers are expected to have been major positives. Growing memory demand, thanks to DRAM technology node transitions in support of advanced memories such as DDR5 and HBM, is likely to have benefited the quarterly performance.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s increasing investments in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) infrastructure are likely to have benefited its performance in the quarter under review. The service business of ASML is expected to have performed well, fueled by the increasing contribution of EUV services.\r\n\r\nStrength in low numerical aperture (NA) and high NA machines is likely to have benefited the company\u2019s Installed Base business. The growing uptake of NXE:3800 low NA machine, which has the capability to deliver a robust performance with a productivity of 220 wafers per hour, is likely to have driven EUV sales.\r\n\r\nIn regard to high NA, the rising shipment of 0.55 NA EUV is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the impacts of market uncertainties related to the challenging macroeconomic environment are expected to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarterly results. Rising tensions between the United States and China, due to which there are constraints on selling leading-edge semiconductors and equipment to China, are likely to have been major headwinds.\r\n\r\nAlthough ASML has started witnessing inventory moving toward healthy levels in recent times, high inventory is still likely to have been concerning.\r\n\r\nWeak momentum among logic customers, as they continue to digest the significant capacity additions made over the past year, is anticipated to have been a negative.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nASML Holding\u2019s shares have appreciated 43.3% on a year-to-date basis, slightly below the industry\u2019s 44% growth. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s shares have outperformed the S&P 500 index\u2019s rise of 18.2% and Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s rally of 28.7%.\r\n\r\nASML has outperformed its peer Lam Research\u2019s LRCX 36.5% return but underperformed Applied Materials\u2019 AMAT 50.1% gain year to date.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow, let us look at the value ASML Holding offers investors at current levels.\n\nCurrently, ASML is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 41.64X compared with the industry\u2019s 34.14X and higher than the median of 36.95X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nASML's P/E F12M Graph Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nASML\u2019s comprehensive product portfolio is aligned with customers\u2019 roadmaps, which makes it capable of delivering cost-effective solutions to support all kinds of applications. Hence, ASML is well-positioned to ride on the growing proliferation of AI, energy transition and global megatrends in the electronics industry, which, in turn, are expected to fuel growth across the semiconductor market.\r\n\r\nThe company has orders from a number of new fabs being constructed across the world. Management expects a better second half of 2024 and a cyclical upturn for 2025. ASML\u2019s growing efforts to add and improve capacity to meet current and future customer demand with the support of its supply-chain partners are other positives.\r\n\r\nHowever, end-market volatility, U.S.-China tensions, mounting expenses and weakening momentum in logic make near-term prospects of ASML foggy. The company expects lower logic revenues this year than last year.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nFor those wondering how to play ASML stock ahead of the second-quarter 2024 earnings report, a nuanced approach may be warranted. While the company\u2019s long-term prospects are promising as the semiconductor industry continues to regain momentum, investors should not rush in to buy the stock. Instead, they should monitor the stock\u2019s developments closely for a more appropriate entry point, as an erroneous and hasty decision could affect portfolio gains.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks With Breakout Potential: July Edition",
        "content": "Breakout semiconductor stocks are set to soar, fueled by the unstoppable AI wave.\n\nAI has turbocharged the top semiconductor businesses, pushing them towards explosive growth in the past 12 months. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales jumped an impressive 19.3% year-over-year (YOY) in May. The stellar May performance followed a superb 15.8% growth in April, marking the first monthly increase of the year.\n\nMoreover, these trends align with Grand View Research projections, which expect the AI market to grow from $137 billion in 2022 to an astonishing $1.81 trillion by 2030. Hence, the future looks remarkably bright for semiconductor stocks as the AI boom continues to evolve.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat said, here are three breakout semiconductor stocks to watch, benefiting from the AI boom and poised for long-term expansion ahead. Additionally, these companies feature strong fundamentals and are positioned for significant growth alongside the fast-growing AI space.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a table\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a stalwart in the semiconductor industry, having been in business for over 45 years. While already a standout wealth compounder in its niche, the AI boom has taken things up a notch or two for MU stock. It has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI spending surge, with its stock gaining over 108% in the past year.\n\nHowever, unlike the AI bandwagoners, Micron\u2019s superb fundamentals reflect its lofty stock market performance. This is evident in its third-quarter (Q3) earnings print, where non-GAAP EPS of 62 cents beat estimates by nine cents. Moreover, sales jumped to $6.81 billion, marking a robust 81.6% increase on a YOY basis to beat forecasts by $140 million.\n\nFollowing the blow-out result, President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra noted, \u201cRobust AI demand and strong execution enabled Micron to drive 17% sequential revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range in fiscal Q3.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, its operating cash flow also saw a tremendous jump to $2.48 billion from just $24 million in the prior-year period. Therefore, Micron remains in an excellent position to continue capitalizing on AI\u2019s expansive growth opportunities alongside other breakout semiconductor stocks.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is one of the leading designers of AI chips and infrastructure utilized by the biggest names in the tech world. Like its peers, it has witnessed superb momentum in its stock price in the past year, gaining almost 20% year-to-date (YTD). Moreover, given its robust positioning in the AI revolution, Wall Street expects a 26% upside in MRVL stock, assigning a consensus \u2018strong buy\u2019 rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite a lukewarm performance in its second quarter (Q2), the firm expects a much improved showing in Q3 and beyond. It forecasts an 8% sequential revenue growth for the next quarter, with an optimistic outlook for back-end of the year. This encouraging growth is linked to a ramp-up in custom AI silicon production along with a recovery in enterprise networking and carrier infrastructure.\n\nFurthermore, investing in MRVL stock comes with a dividend. It has paid a dividend for the past 11 consecutive years, yielding 0.32%. Hence, with the expected expansion in data center operations and a recovery in its networking business, MRVL stock remains an excellent bet in the semiconductor space.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is a semiconductor manufacturing specialist known for its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These machines are critical in developing advanced computer chips and, unique to ASML, facilitate the complex patterning of silicon wafers needed for semiconductor production. Consequently, ASML has established itself as one of the most important companies in the AI revolution.\n\nASML stock soared 50% in the past year, outperforming the broader market. However, it has long been surfing the powerful secular trends sweeping through the semiconductor industry. To put things in perspective, ASML stock has jumped upwards of 400% in the past five years. Moreover, despite posting lofty gains in the past year, according to Wall Street analysts, ASML stock may only jump another 5%.\n\nThe future looks remarkably bright for ASML, with forward revenue and EBITDA expected to be 19.4% and 27.6%, respectively. Much of the enthusiasm is due to ASML\u2019s EUV lithography machines and its powerful role in powering the AI industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks With the Potential to Pave Your Path to Riches",
        "content": "It was inevitable that tech stocks with massive potential and reach would be the titans of the digital age. Six out of seven trillion-dollar companies are in tech, as are some of the closest stocks to that trillion-dollar mark. Their growth, potential applications, capacity to lift entire markets, and massive global footprint make them some of the best investments in the market. Whether you\u2019re shooting for massive growth or bulking up your retirement funds, you need these tech stocks in your portfolio.\n\nThat said, we can\u2019t forget the possibility of overvaluation. We\u2019ve all learned our lessons during the dot-com bubble, and careful investors don\u2019t want a repeat. They know how to look for signs of good tech stocks with great potential.\n\nTo get my list of tech stocks to buy, I screened the market for\u00a0market cap at $200 billion and more, buy rating from analysts, consecutive increase in revenue in the last three fiscal years, and positive YOY earnings growth. This ensures I focus only on Wall Street favorites that consistently perform and grow despite market conditions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the leading semiconductor and infrastructure solutions providers today, and one of the best tech stocks with massive potential, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) specializes in cyber security and software licensing. It is currently valued at around $812 billion.\n\nThe company is expected to undergo a stock split on July 12 at a 10 to 1 split ratio. This means that stockholders will end up with more shares trading at lower prices, which companies usually do to lower the entry point for retail investors.\n\nIn some cases, the split helps the stock price grow higher despite having no change in its fundamentals, similar to how NVDA climbed around 30% after its split. With its acquisition of VMWare, boom in AI, and strong buy recommendation from analysts, I won\u2019t be surprised if investors jump in on AVGO after the split happens.\n\nOver the last few years, the massive boost in AI demands fueled Broadcom\u2019s impressive growth. Revenue started at $23.88 billion in FY2020, growing yearly and ending at $35.82 billion in FY2023.\n\nThis growth is reflected in the bottom line, with 2020 recording a $2.96 billion net income and 2023 reporting a massive increase to $14.08 billion, which reflects a 22.51% increase from 2022\u2019s $11.5 billion.\u00a0AVGO stock also has a strong buy rating, highlighting its potential as one of the best tech stocks to buy.\n\nOracle Corporation (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThis software juggernaut, valued at nearly $400 billion, stands toe-to-toe with the tech giants. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) offers a range of enterprise applications, technologies and cloud-engineered systems. The company\u2019s operations operate in three main segments:\n\nServices: provides its customers with various support that help maximize their Oracle applications products. Hardware: offers enterprise hardware and software, including servers, storage, and operating systems. Cloud and license: provides cloud-related products and licenses for enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies.\n\nThe company has a long-standing partnership with Microsoft, allowing Azure users access to Oracle\u2019s database.\n\nOracle recently released its FY2024 report showing total revenue reached nearly $53 billion. Oracle has continued its three-year streak of consistent top-line growth. This is impressive, considering the company\u2019s size. Net income also increased by 23% YOY in FY2024.\n\nAnalysts rate ORCL a strong buy, marking it as one of the top tech stocks with excellent growth potential.\n\nASML Holding NY (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML HoldingNY (NASDAQ:ASML) is a company that provides equipment for semiconductor fabrication facilities worldwide. The company offers photolithography equipment required for chip manufacturing, giving it a strong foothold in tech and making it a beneficiary of the AI boom. Their main products fall under two categories:\n\nExtreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography: allows manufacturers to increase transistor numbers in chip production Deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography: used for high-volume manufacturing\n\nLike the others on this list, ASML has experienced an impressive revenue growth streak, going from $17.1 billion in FY2020 to $30.4 billion in FY2023. Meanwhile, net income also nearly doubled from $4.34 billion in FY2020 to $8.659 billion in FY2023.\n\nAnalysts see ASML as one of the top tech stocks with potential multi-digit returns this year, rating it a strong buy. Investors interested in the stock might want to get in on the action before things kick off and the market buys ASML stock in bulk.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford\u00a0held long positions in ASML.

        "title": "7 Semiconductor Stocks Surging on the Back of the Tech Boom",
        "content": "These days, you don\u2019t need much extra motivation to consider the bullish case of surging semiconductor stocks. Yes, the spotlight is on the individual innovations, such as artificial intelligence or automated mobility. But these and other advancements must be fueled by something \u2013 that something is the underlying semiconductor architecture.\n\nIn the immediate sense, the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite index took a heavy blow on Thursday. Yes, the benchmark S&P 500 incurred an almost 1% dip. However, the Nasdaq suffered a nearly 2% erosion. Further, individual names within the innovation ecosystem suffered considerable damage. Over the long run, though, the red ink could end up representing a discounted entry point.\n\nFundamentally, computer chips represent the backbone of all modern electronic devices. Because of this reality, the entire chip-manufacturing supply chain is a vital component of the global economy. The next geopolitical flashpoint could even spark because of access to these chips. With that in mind, below are surging semiconductor stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nKnown as the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) has unsurprisingly performed well this year. Since the beginning of January, TSM stock gained nearly 82% of equity value. One of the pioneers in advanced process technologies like 3 nanometer (nm), Taiwan Semiconductor \u2013 abbreviated as TSMC \u2013 caters to high-demand sectors like AI and 5G.\n\nJust as well, TSM stock isn\u2019t just a strong performer in the charts; it\u2019s also delivering the goods in the financial statements. In the past four quarters, the tech specialist posted an average earnings per share of $1.32. This beat the analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.24, translating to a positive earnings surprise of 6.55%.\n\nNow, the one issue with TSM stock is the valuation. Right now, shares trade at 37X trailing-year earnings and 14.34X trailing-year sales. In contrast, between the first quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the aforementioned multiples hit an average of 16.28X and 7.65X, respectively.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate continued expansion, with EPS rising 22.16% to $6.34. Revenue could jump 22.1% to $84.74 billion. It\u2019s one of the top surging semiconductor stocks.\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Netherlands, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) offers multiple chip-related products. Its main product portfolio includes microcontrollers and application processors. Fundamentally, NXP represents one of the leading providers of secure connectivity solutions for embedded applications. The company distinguishes itself through automotive chips, which are used for driver safety systems along with autonomous systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the start of the year, NXPI stock gained over 24% of equity value. However, as with Taiwan Semiconductor, the good news isn\u2019t just focused on the charts. In the past four quarters, NXP posted an average EPS of $3.52. This figure beat out the average consensus view of $3.42, translating to an earnings surprise of just over 3%.\n\nOf course, the boost in value comes at a cost. Right now, NXPI stock trades at 26.1X trailing-year earnings and 5.55X trailing-year revenue. In the past year, the metrics averaged 19.39X and 4.25X, respectively.\n\nIt must be said that analysts expect some softness in fiscal 2024. However, in the following year, EPS could rise 14.39% to $15.90. Sales might enjoy a 9% lift to $14.24 billion. It\u2019s another solid idea for surging semiconductor stocks to consider.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAnother Dutch enterprise, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) falls under the semiconductor equipment and materials industry. Per its public profile, ASML develops, produces, markets, sells and services advanced chip-making equipment systems. Specifically, the company has gained fame for its lithography tech, which facilitates the printing of complex designs on silicon wafers. It\u2019s quite literally one of the most important companies in the world.\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, ASML stock gained over 48% of market value. That\u2019s not surprising in the least. On a financial note, the semiconductor specialist posted an average EPS of $4.85 over the past four quarters. In contrast, analysts estimated that EPS would land at only $4.50. This performance translated to an earnings surprise of 8.2%.\n\nOf course, with such a robust business, ASML stock does not offer a discount. Right now, shares trade hands at 56.18X earnings and 15.31X sales. However, the metrics averaged 35.61X and 10.8X, respectively, in the past year.\n\nExperts see a modest bump in business in fiscal 2024. However, by fiscal 2025, revenue may jump to $39.92 billion. If so, that would represent a 32.6% lift, making ASML one of the surging semiconductor stocks to consider.\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Chandler, Arizona, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) engages in the development, manufacturer and sales of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions in the Americas and other international regions. Fundamentally, Microchip is one of the most relevant of surging semiconductor stocks thanks to its vast portfolio of microcontrollers, analog and mixed-signal solutions.\n\nNow, it must be said that MCHP stock has only gained 6.4% YTD. However, in the past five years, it has more than doubled in value. Further, while the company hasn\u2019t exactly delivered resoundingly strong financials, it posted an average EPS of $1.23 in the past four quarters. Analysts estimated earnings of $1.22 per share during that time, translating to an earnings surprise of 1.1%.\n\nAs with other names mentioned here, MCHP stock is trading at a relative premium, though not to as great of a magnitude. Right now, MCHP trades at 27.58X earnings and 6.89X sales. In the past year, the metrics sat at 20.69X and 5.61X, respectively.\n\nAdmittedly, both earnings and sales could take a bit hit by year\u2019s end. However, a sizable recovery trek could begin in the following year, with EPS rising to $4.15 on sales of $6.86 billion.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest names among surging semiconductor stocks, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops and supplies various semiconductor devices. However, its main focus is on complex digital and mixed-signal solutions. Broadcom distinguishes itself with its strong presence in the wireless communication realm. It also serves the enterprise storage and broadband sectors.\n\nAlthough it took a recent hit in terms of volatility, AVGO stock gained over 57% of market value in the year so far. Over the past 52 weeks, the company also doubled in value. Even with rising expectations, Broadcom posted an average EPS of $10.89. This figure beat out the average consensus view of $10.63, resulting in an earnings surprise of 2.45%.\n\nOf course, AVGO stock comes at a premium. Shares trade at 75.17X earnings and 18.4X sales. In the past year, these metrics sat at 27.74X and 11.44X, respectively. That goes to show you the tremendous success that Broadcom achieved.\n\nHowever, there could be more growth on the way. Fiscal 2024 earnings could rise almost 13% to $47.58 per share. Revenue may sese a 43.7% boost to $51.46 billion.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Wilmington, Delaware, Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides data infrastructure solutions, spanning multiple sectors from the data center to the network edge. Primarily, the company develops and scales complex System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architectures. It\u2019s a key player in the storage, networking and connectivity ecosystems. In particular, it serves the cloud, enterprise and automotive markets.\n\nWith so many sectors integrating connectivity solutions, Marvell should see increased demand. Since the start of the year, MRVL stock gained 24%. Financially, it\u2019s not as remarkable as some of the other enterprises. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of 36 cents, matching the consensus view. However, the earnings surprise came in at 0.4%.\n\nStill, MRVL stock trades at a premium. Right now, the market prices shares at 54.35X earnings and 12.09X revenue. In the past year, these metrics sat at 32.37X and 8.67X, respectively. To be fair, experts see a rough road in the current fiscal year, with earnings and sales projected to dip modestly.\n\nHowever, a recovery could materialize in the following year, with EPS jumping 74.64% to $2.41. Sales might land at $7.18 billion, up 32.8%. Thus, it\u2019s one of the surging semiconductor stocks to monitor closely.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Boise, Idaho, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) designs, develops, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. It\u2019s relevant among surging semiconductor stocks thanks to being a leading provider of memory and storage solutions. Fundamentally, the company distinguishes itself through various flash memory innovations, and serve applications presenting indirect solutions for emerging innovations like AI and autonomous mobility.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, MU stock gained over 58% of market value. In the past year, it has more than doubled in price. Yet the underlying financial performance suggests more growth may be possible. Notably, in the past two quarters, Micron\u2019s EPS averaged 52 cents. In contrast, analysts were looking for only 13 cents.\n\nHowever, the valuation seems relatively reasonable. Currently, MU stock trades at 15.2X forward earnings, below the sector median 30.1X. While its price-to-sales multiple is elevated at near 7X, it\u2019s still not bad for what the company brings to the table.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts see a big rise in sales to $25.07 billion. If this projection holds true, it would mean a 61.3% lift from last year, making MU one of the surging semiconductor stocks to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Netflix results, retail sales, and a chip update: What to watch this week",
        "content": "The biggest economic event of July has come and gone.\n\nFor the balance of the month, investors will focus most of their attention on the corporate earnings calendar.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) will be the first Big Tech company to report quarterly earnings during the current reporting period, with the streaming giant set to release results after the close on Thursday.\n\nAnd with the AI trade continuing to dominate on Wall Street, investors will pay close attention to results from ASML (ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), set for release Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nASML is the leading manufacturer of lithography machines, which enable companies to actually imprint their designs onto new chips. TSMC is the world's biggest chip manufacturer.\n\nElsewhere on the earnings calendar, reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) will wrap up results from Wall Street's biggest banks, while Dow members Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Travelers (TRV) are all expected to report.\n\nPolitics will also be a top concern for investors after Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Business leaders were quick to react to the day's events, condemning political violence and praising the former president's \"courage under literal fire [Saturday night].\"\n\nThe Republican National Convention is set to be held this week in Milwaukee, which will see Trump formally named the Republican nominee for president.\n\nThe economic data calendar will be sparse, with Tuesday's retail sales report for June serving as the highlight. After May's results showed a surprise slowdown in spending, investors and Fed watchers will monitor the results for signs of further weakness in the US consumer.\n\nThe team at Oxford Economics expects retail sales to fall 0.4% in June, though this headline drop will be driven by a decline in gas prices. \"We expect a solid 0.3% rise in underlying control group sales, which, with prices declining in June, will translate into a strong rise in real consumption to round out Q2,\" the firm wrote in a note on Friday.\n\n\"The consumer is still in solid shape, underpinned by a labor market that is cooling, not collapsing, and the strong state of household balance sheets.\"\n\nThursday's inflation data turned markets upside down, with everything that had been working (read: \"Magnificent Seven\" names) coming under pressure and what had been left behind, most notably small caps, surging. Still, Friday's rally sent stocks into the weekend with another weekly gain across the board.\n\nStory continues\n\nJuly \u27a1\ufe0f September\n\nJune inflation data published last week appeared to almost cement the prospects of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates beginning in September.\n\nA multiyear low in annual inflation and the first monthly drop in headline inflation since 2020 pushed the odds north of 85% that rate cuts will start in the fall, data from the CME Group showed.\n\nIn June, headline inflation fell 0.1% from the prior month and rose 3% against the prior year. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy costs, consumer prices were up 0.2% from last month and 3.3% from last year.\n\nThe Fed targets 2% inflation.\n\nJune's jobs report published earlier this month raised the temperature on the Fed to act in September. The unemployment rate move up to 4.1% signaled the pace of cooling in the labor market appears to be accelerating and puts the labor market back in focus for the central bank after nearly two years of inflation being its primary concern.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell's appearance on Capitol Hill last week made clear the central bank's move this fall will be perceived as a political decision by critics on both sides of the aisle. But the economic basis for a rate cut has only grown clearer in recent weeks.\n\n\"On balance, the economic data are the most supportive of a rate cut that they have been all year,\" wrote Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Michael Pugliese in a client note this week.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre noted this week, the unemployment rate is now on the cusp of triggering the Sahm Rule, which measures the rate of increase in the unemployment rate and has been a leading indicator in each of the last nine US recessions.\n\nOn July 31, Powell will hold a press conference following the conclusion of the Fed's next two-day policy meeting. This event, along with Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late August, will give the chair plenty of opportunity to prime markets for a move come September.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has triggered a multi-year investment cycle across the enterprise. Additionally, generative AI is now permeating various consumer internet applications. These trends bode well for AI wealth-building stocks.\n\nIn Q1 of fiscal year 2024, a huge moment of clarity appeared on AI spending as cloud service providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) increased their capital expenditure plans. Indeed, it was a stark reminder of the heavy investment needed to make AI applications and products a reality. Bank of America projects capex for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon will increase by $37 billion in 2024 to $145 billion.\n\nMoreover, according to Capital Group, big tech giants are raising their capital expenditure budgets and will spend an estimated $500 billion over the next three years. This spending will go toward chips, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Plus, a substantial proportion will cover memory, servers and network equipment. This means more profits will flow to these three AI wealth-building stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCustom ASICs have emerged as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s H100 and B200 GPUs. After Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is the second-largest player in this fast-growing high-end market, with a 13-15% share.\n\nJPMorgan analysts are bullish on Marvell Technology as one of the AI wealth-building stocks to buy. They forecast that the high-end ASIC market will grow to between $20 and $30 billion. Additionally, due to demand from generative AI, this market will grow at a 20% compounded annual growth rate.\n\nBuoyed by this growth, the company\u2019s AI revenues could skyrocket. Notably, the chip maker is working with various big tech companies on custom silicon. It has been collaborating with Google on its 5-nanometer Axion ARM CPU chip and Amazon on its 5-nanometer Tranium chip. Additionally, rumors are buzzing that it\u2019s working with Microsoft on its Maia chip and Amazon on its Inferentia chip.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, JPMorgan analysts think MRVL could generate $1.6 to $1.8 billion in revenues from networking and custom ASICs this year. Moreover, they expect AI revenues to double next year. Additionally, most analysts are extremely bullish, with 28 buy ratings and a median price target of $90, representing over 20% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a 10% pullback, it is time to buy Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). The memory maker is among the best-positioned AI wealth-building stocks due to its high bandwidth memory (HBM). Importantly, HBM memory reduces bottlenecks, increasing training efficiency for large language models.\n\nAlthough Micron Technology tumbled after Q3 of FY 2024 earnings, the results were stellar. The company blew past estimates, reporting revenues of $6.81 billion for the third quarter against estimates of $6.67 billion. Data center drove the strength as AI demand led to 50% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) growth in the segment. Furthermore, the company grew its share in high-margin AI products such as data center solid-state drives and HBM.\n\nAnother impressive highlight was the company disclosing that HBM chips were sold out for 2024 and 2025. Due to robust demand, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sanjay Mehrotra noted in Q3 prepared remarks that Micron Technology was on track for record FY 2024 revenues. Besides, he expects this momentum to carry over into FY 2025.\n\nIndeed, MU is set for a banner FY 2025 due to AI demand, making it one of the top AI wealth-building stocks. Moreover, an ongoing shift from commoditized memory to high-margin AI products will boost profitability.\n\nASML Holding N.Y. (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAs demand for AI accelerates, semiconductor foundries and integrated device manufacturers are scrambling to increase capacity. This ramp-up spells opportunity for ASML Holding N.Y. (NASDAQ:ASML), the maker of EUV machines used to manufacture chips.\n\nSeveral reasons prevail for maintaining a bullish stance on ASML. First, AI-related revenue is soaring due to memory demand driven by advanced memories such as HBM and DDR5. As a result, the semiconductor equipment maker is seeing increasing orders from memory makers like Micron Technology.\n\nSecondly, the firm benefits from increased subsidies and grants to the semiconductor sector. Due to incentives and grants from laws such as the CHIPS and Science Act, chip manufacturers are opening new facilities. For instance, Micron Technology is constructing new fabs in New York and Idaho. In line with this expansion, it will spend $8 billion of capex in 2024 and increase it to a mid-30s percentage of revenue in 2025.\n\nThe outlook for ASML is very positive. Almost every foundry and integrated device maker is constructing new chip manufacturing facilities. Companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung Electronics and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have broken ground on new projects in the U.S. and Europe. These facilities will be filled with ASML equipment, making the stock a top buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Quarterly earnings season is about to quick start again, with key companies across the globe providing insights into how certain sectors are performing.\n\nInvestors next week will see updates from the mining world, with our focus staying on Anglo American, while Burberry will provide a gauge on the luxury goods industry after a slowdown in demand from China hit sales.\n\nIn Asia, semiconductor colossus TSMC is expected to come in above expectations, amid the artificial intelligence craze and ongoing demand for chips.\n\nAcross the pond, Netflix will try to convince investors it is as popular as ever, with revenue and earnings increases in the cards.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L) \u2013 Reports trading update on Thursday, 18 July\n\nAnglo-American was the target of a takeover bid by rival BHP (BHP.L) and it has announced its own restructuring plans in the aftermath of the failed mining mega-merger. So, investors will be sure to put the company\u2019s first-half figures under the microscope.\n\nAnglo is aiming to sell or separate its coal, platinum, nickel and diamond mining operations. What\u2019s left will be a streamlined business that contains the company\u2019s prized copper mines (BHP\u2019s main target), its premium iron ore business and the Woodsmith fertiliser project in North Yorkshire.\n\nAnglo is heavily exposed to copper and the industrial metal\u2019s price is just starting to pull back after a strong run.\n\nFor the actual earnings report, AJ Bell tells investors to look for any hints on production costs.\n\n\u201cThe details on the balance sheet, cash flow and profit and loss account will come with the actual first-half numbers, although do watch out for any changes in output forecasts and targets, as well as comments on cost of production and capital investment, since all of those will directly influence profits and cash flow,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How FTSE All-Share index listings are changing\n\n\u201cIn the unlikely event that [CEO Duncan] Wanblad discusses annual profits or the dividend ahead of the first-half results in the following week, the current consensus forecast is for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to come in broadly flat in 2024, at $9.7bn, while a cut in the dividend to $0.83 per share from $0.96 is expected.\u201d\n\nThe share price is still around 20% higher than it was before BHP\u2019s interest became public on 25 April.\n\nBurberry (BRBY.L) - Reports trading update on Friday, 19 July\n\nTrenchcoat-maker Burberry is not expected to impress investors next week, with retail same-store sales estimated to come in 16% lower in its fiscal first quarter, a slump made even starker by 18% growth in the same period last year.\n\nUBS expects the focus to be on Chinese sales \u201cas well as any signs of stabilisation/improvement among other consumer groups (i.e. Americans and Europeans)\u201d.\n\nJP Morgan has warned that the \u2018re-acceleration\u2019 of the luxury sector could be slower than anticipated, leading to downside risk for luxury stocks.\n\n\u201cThe troubled times continue for Burberry, which has engaged in a round of sweeping job cuts in order to reduce costs. Sales fell 4% for the year to the end of March, and it looks like demand in the key market of China will continue to weaken,\u201d IG said.\n\nShares in Burberry are down by more than half over the past year, to take them back to levels last seen in 2010.\n\nCompared to its five-year average PE of 17 times earnings, Burberry now looks cheap at 11 times earnings. IG analysts warned that while the dividend yield is a solid 7%, investors should be aware that the payout may be cut should the group\u2019s sales outlook continue to worsen.\n\nFor the year to March 2025, analysts currently expect sales to drop 6% to \u00a32.8bn.\n\nTSMC (TSM) \u2013 Reports quarterly update on Thursday, 18 July\n\nThe AI craze has pushed Nvidia as other Magnificent 7 stocks to new heights but there is no AI without chips. And they are (almost) all being manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\u2019s key tech giant clients such as Nvidia and Apple have almost nowhere else to turn for next-gen chip manufacturing.\n\nTSMC\u2019s anticipated order for next-generation two-nanometer technology will be a key catalyst in the second half, according to Citi analysts, who see AI and sovereign investment adding upside to the company\u2019s 2030 revenue target of \u20ac44bn to \u20ac60bn, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe Taiwan-based silicon giant disclosed in its latest monthly revenue report that net income for June was NT$207.87bn billion ($6.4bn), an increase of 32.9% compared with a year ago.\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFigures for May and April were NT$229.62bn ($7.04bn/) and NT$236.02bnn (\u00a35.41bn/$7.24bn), both up on the same period last year. TSMC is projected to grow sales by roughly 21% in FY24 and FY25.\n\n\u201cTaiwan Semiconductor is one of the most straightforward buy-and-hold options in all of technology alongside the likes of Nvidia and others because chips are the lifeblood of the economy and TSM is the semiconductor manufacturer,\u201d according to Zachs Research.\n\n\u201cAny near-term pullback down to some of Taiwan Semiconductor stock\u2019s key shorter-dated or longer-dated moving averages could mark a screaming buy signal for long-term investors,\u201d Zachs\u2019 analysts added.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) \u2013 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday, 18 July\n\nSynonymous with streaming services, Netflix will show investors how it is fighting to stay on top and prove it can keep attracting new subscribers amid fierce competition.\n\nNetflix expects its revenue to increase 16% year-over-year (YoY) to $9.49bn (\u00a37.3bn) in the second quarter of 2024 but analysts predict Netflix's Q2 revenue will be slightly higher at $9.53bn. In the first quarter of 2024, Netflix's revenue was $9.37bn, up 15% from the prior year.\n\nMorningstar equity analyst Matthew Dolphin provides a guide to what investors should focus on. \u201cWe're most interested in details on Netflix's ad-supported service, especially regarding how the firm is coming along in monetising it, as well as an update on the size of the ad-supported user base,\" he said.\n\n\u201cGenerally, we'll be looking to see if subscriber growth is slowing substantially after Netflix passed the tailwind from its password-sharing crackdown, and whether it will stop regularly disclosing this metric in 2025.\n\n\u201cWe will also be interested in international sales and subscriber growth. This will be a key driver for the company when/if domestic growth slows,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs AJ Bell writes, Netflix no longer gives specific guidance for quarterly net subscriber additions, although co-chief executive officers Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos did suggest at the first-quarter stage that net adds would come in below the first quarter\u2019s bumper 9.3 million (the best first quarter since the pandemic and lockdowns in Q1 2020). That took the total subscriber base to a fraction under 270 million, up from 233 million in Q1 2023 and 167 million before the pandemic swept the globe.\n\nMatt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, is also keen to look at subscribers: \u201cOne thing to watch for is the number of new paid subscribers in the second quarter. Management has already warned it\u2019ll be lower quarter-on-quarter due to the normal seasonal demand patterns. These have been a little skewed in recent years, but looking at 2018/19 numbers, net new subscribers were down 34% and 70% respectively across the first and second quarters \u2013 so don\u2019t be surprised to see something in that range.\n\n\u201cBest in class content is one of the reasons Netflix has been able to consistently deliver sector leading churn rates. It\u2019s expensive, but Netflix remains the only company set to increase content spend, giving a comparative advantage versus legacy media and its challengers.\u201d\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday, 15 July\n\nRobert Walters (RWA.L)\n\nOrkla (ORK.OL)\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS)\n\nBlackRock (BLK)\n\nTuesday, 16 July\n\nOcado (OCDO.L)\n\nIntermediate Capital (ICG.L)\n\nB&M European Value Retail (BME.L)\n\nBloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L)\n\nMcBride (MCB.L)\n\nRichemont (CFR.SW)\n\nNCC (NCC.L)\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH)\n\nBank of America (BAC)\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS)\n\nOmnicom (OMC)\n\nWednesday, 17 July\n\nRenold (RNO.L)\n\nHVIVO (HVO.L)\n\nBHP (BHP.L)\n\nASML (ASML)\n\nAssa Abloy (ASSA-B.ST)\n\nSvenska Handelsbanken (SHB-B.ST)\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ)\n\nCSX (CSX)\n\nUS Bancorp (USBC.VI)\n\nLas Vegas Sands (LVS)\n\nCitizens Financial (CZFS)\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL)\n\nAlcoa (AA)\n\nBank OZK (OZK)\n\nThursday, 18 July\n\nSSE (SSE.L)\n\nDiploma (DPLM.L)\n\nDunelm (DNLM.L)\n\nKier (KIE.L)\n\nQinetiQ (QQ.L)\n\nABB (ABBNY)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATCO-A.ST)\n\nVolvo (VOLV-A.ST)\n\nEQT (EQT)\n\nPublicis (PUB.PA)\n\nNokia (NOK)\n\nVolvo Car (VOLCAR-B.ST)\n\nSKF (SKF-B.ST)\n\nAbbott Labs (ABL.MU)\n\nBlackstone (BX)\n\nDR Horton (DHI)\n\nTractor Supply (TSCO)\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ)\n\nInterpublic (IPG)\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL)\n\nAlaska Airlines (ALK)\n\nFriday, 19 July\n\nBridgepoint (BPT.L)\n\nSchindler (SHLRF)\n\nKone (KNEBV.HE)\n\nSandvik (SAND.ST)\n\nSaab (SAABBS.XC)\n\nElectrolux (ELUXY)\n\nAmerican Express (AXP)\n\nSchlumberger (SLB)\n\nHalliburton (HAL)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "ASML Holdings ASML, a Dutch company, is the undisputed leader in photolithography machines, and a critical provider to the semiconductor industry.\n\nNot only does ASML enjoy a competitive advantage in its industry, which has led to tremendous sales, earnings and stock price growth over the last decade, but it also currently boasts Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.\n\nFurthermore, because of the continued expansion of technology and the digital world, as well as the boom in artificial intelligence, ASML Holdings makes for a very attractive stock to consider investing in today. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nASML Holdings Industry Dominance\n\nASML\u2019s machines are the secret sauce behind the tiny transistors that power our modern electronics. Its technology is crucial because it allows chipmakers to etch ever-more intricate patterns onto silicon wafers, cramming more power into smaller and smaller chips. This relentless miniaturization drives the constant improvement of our phones, laptops, and all sorts of tech.\n\nWhat makes ASML so important? They've cornered the market the highly advanced technology, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). EUV allows for the creation of super tiny circuits, a must-have for next-generation technologies.\n\nDeveloping EUV machines is incredibly expensive and complex, and ASML has a huge head start. They've poured years of research and billions of dollars into perfecting it, making them the only company that can produce these machines on a commercial scale.\n\nThis creates a nearly impenetrable barrier for any competitor hoping to challenge their dominance. Chipmakers rely so heavily on ASML's expertise that switching to a new supplier would be a risky and expensive gamble. This fosters strong, long-term partnerships, solidifying ASML's position as an essential player in the ever-evolving world of semiconductors.\n\nRobust Growth Forecasts for ASML\u2019s Sales and Earnings\n\nAnalysts have raised earnings estimates for ASML Holdings over the past two months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.\n\nAlthough analysts expect sales and earnings to sputter for FY24, with sales expected to decline 1.25% YoY and earnings to fall 6.5%, next quarter\u2019s sales and earnings and next year\u2019s sales and earnings are projected to snap higher.\n\nNext quarter sales are projected to jump 14.5% YoY and EPS are expected to climb 15.7%. Furthermore, FY25 sales are projected to increase 36.2% YoY and earnings are forecast to jump 55% higher.\n\nASML Stock Price Breakout\n\nASML stock has been showing bullish activity all year, and the current setup is no different. In the chart below, we can see that ASML has been building bullish technical patterns and breaking higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust last week, the stock broke out again after coiling for nearly a month. This move higher has pushed the stock to new all-time highs, and it appears it wants to continue to rally. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBottom Line\n\nASML Holdings presents a compelling investment opportunity at the intersection of technological innovation and strong financial performance.\n\nTheir dominance in photolithography positions them as a critical partner for the ever-expanding world of semiconductors. This, coupled with a top Zacks Rank and robust growth forecasts, makes ASML a stock with significant potential for long-term investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "China is still a decade behind the U.S. in chip technology\u2014but the world still needs the mature chips it\u2019s making, says ASML\u2019s CEO",
        "content": "\"Overcapacity\" is the recent buzzword from Western governments trying to criticize China's manufacturing policies, arguing that China is producing more than it can consume, and dumping the surplus in foreign markets. Officials apply the term to Chinese EVs, solar panels, and increasingly the \"mature\" chips used in everything from cars to consumer electronics.\n\nChristophe Fouquet, the CEO of Dutch semiconductor company ASML, has a different view. In an interview with German business outlet Handelsblatt, published Monday, Fouquet argued the world needs the legacy chips coming out of China. Demand for these components is rising, but chipmakers are loath to expand production due to their slim margins.\n\nEurope can't cover half the chip it needs, Fouquet said. \u201cThere is no point in stopping someone from producing something you need. With Russian gas, people have understood that alternatives must be found, but not yet with chips,\u201d he said.\n\nEconomies like Germany, the U.S. and Japan are offering subsidies to attract chipmakers to set up domestic operations. Yet China is overtaking them all: The country will have 18 chip projects starting operations this year for mature chips, more than any other country, according to the U.S. industry group SEMI.\n\nIn response to a question about further export restrictions, Fouquet said governments worried about China needed to build their own factories. \"It's not acceptable to make manufacturing more difficult for China and not create alternatives ourselves,\" he said.\n\nSubsidies may help attract some non-Chinese chipmakers to set up a local or regional supply chain. But analysts warn that legacy chip programs may not be economically sustainable due to lower margins in the industry.\n\nFouquet estimated that China is currently a decade behind the U.S. in chip technology. ASML is barred from selling its most advanced machinery to China, and even its less-advanced tools are now in Washington's crosshairs.\n\nU.S. chip controls may be pushing Chinese companies to be more active in the legacy chip sector, analysts previously told Fortune. Chinese chipmakers could be trying to insulate themselves from further sanctions, but they may also see less advanced chip production as a stepping stone to move up the value chain and replace Western technology.\n\nYet Fouquet, in his interview with Handelsblatt, thinks China will struggle to recreate ASML's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, currently the only way to make the most cutting-edge chips. (ASML is the only producer of EUV machines).\n\nStory continues\n\n'Friend of China'\n\nFouquet's predecessor Peter Wennink took to Dutch radio over the weekend to blast the current U.S.-China chip war as an exercise in \"ideology.\"\n\nWennink noted that ASML had to navigate a tightrope between the U.S. and China. ASML wanted to be able to keep selling to China, a major market, so Wennink had to lobby Western governments against tight export restrictions. Yet Wennink said he also had to complain to high-ranking Chinese politicians in order to protect ASML's intellectual property.\n\nThe former ASML CEO complained this juggling act led to Washington officials deeming him a \"friend\" of China.\n\n\"I'm a friend to my customers, to my suppliers, to my employees, to my shareholders,\" he said.\n\nChina was ASML's second-largest market last year, making up a quarter of its total sales. Yet Washington is reportedly pressuring the Netherlands and Japan to expand export controls on Chinese companies, which could affect ASML's business.\n\nWennink, who retired earlier this year after a decade running ASML, complained that geopolitics was making it harder to operate in China. \"These kind of discussions are not being conducted on the basis of facts or content or numbers or data but on the basis of ideology,\" he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Not all semiconductor stocks with skin in the AI boom are egregiously overvalued. Despite the hot run in chip plays, there\u2019s still value in neglected plays that many investors are shying away from for one reason or another. Whether due to unique risks, uncertainties, or other factors, some of the less-crowded and, in many cases, cheaper semiconductor stocks may still be worth snapping up.\n\nUndoubtedly, not every semiconductor firm is going to be the next coming of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The more-than $3 trillion behemoth seems so far ahead of everyone else these days that it\u2019s unrealistic to envision an up-and-comer that has any hope to catch it in the medium term or even the long haul.\n\nThe good news is other semiconductor firms don\u2019t need to become the \u201cnext Nvidia\u201d to make their shareholders money.

Not while it\u2019s enduring considerable challenges in an attempt to turn a corner and make up for ground lost.\n\nNow down nearly 35% year-to-date, INTC stock broke many hearts in the first half. Expensive foundry plans don\u2019t seem to be winning any contrarians. Still, Intel looks relatively affordable at 29.15 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), even if it\u2019s not one of the leaders in the race today.\n\nDespite the relative lack of table-pounding INTC stock bulls, Intel\u2019s management remains optimistic it has a chance to stand up to a giant in Nvidia. Despite impressive new data center chip releases (think the latest Xeon), investors aren\u2019t yet convinced Intel can hit back at Nvidia.\n\nPerhaps lower price points on comparable chips and greater clarity on the foundry front could help INTC stock bottom out. Either way, Intel is not a name to ignore, even after its latest share decline.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those seeking a better value, it can pay dividends to check out the leading semi equipment makers. Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) stock is coming off a parabolic run, with shares up 71% in the past year and 57% year-to-date.\n\nUndoubtedly, AMAT stock\u2019s momentum suggests overbought conditions and perhaps severe overvaluation. However, Applied Materials still looks like a pretty good deal, given the tailwinds that may be sticking around for a year or longer. At writing, shares of AMAT trade at 25.7 times forward P/E, making them appear cheaper than many low-growth consumer staple stocks on the market today.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the company\u2019s EPIC Center hub working on the absolute cutting edge of semi-innovation, the current multiple doesn\u2019t seem to do the stock justice. Perhaps most intriguingly, Applied Materials\u2019 new patterning solutions could pave the way for the industry\u2019s move from the \u201cnanometer era\u201d to the \u201cangstrom era.\u201d It\u2019s an exciting transition that Applied Materials will play a huge role in.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is another semi-equipment maker that has been making higher highs in recent weeks, thanks in part to AI tailwinds. Despite the impressive 50% past-year rally, ASML stock doesn\u2019t look all too expensive at 47.8 times forward P/E. Not when considering the European company\u2019s monopolistic positioning in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine market.\n\nLooking ahead, the big chip fabs will find the need to upgrade their latest etching machines to prepare for the next generation of chips. Indeed, the 2-nanometer process marks the next generation. Beyond that, 1 nanometer and, eventually, a process measured in angstroms.\n\nAs the AI boom continues roaring, I think it\u2019s just a matter of time before the heavyweight fabs start spending big money on ASML\u2019s latest and greatest. Lithography machines do not come cheap. However, as the AI boom rolls on, perhaps the fabs will be more willing to open up their wallets.\n\nNotably, foundry juggernaut Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) stands out as a firm that may put in orders for new ASML EUV machines. UBS analyst Francois-Xavier Bouvignies sees Taiwan Semi as a driving force for ASML the next year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

There is no point in stopping someone from producing something you need,\" Fouquet said.\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling, Editing by Louise Heavens)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 High Priced Stocks That Would Benefit From a Stock Split",
        "content": "Several high-profile stock splits have occurred recently. First, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) decided to implement a 10-for-1 stock split which took effect June 10. Shares are up slightly since then after a period of rapid price increases and subsequent cooling.\n\nThe stock more than doubled in 2024 causing the price to own a single share of Nvidia to surge above $1,000. Prices at that level tend to hurt demand, so splitting the stock is a logical choice.\u00a0Ownership becomes more accessible, increasing demand.\n\nNvidia is not the only high-profile company to recently enact a stock split. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) announced a similar 10-for-1 split that will take effect on July 12. It is expected to have similar positive psychological effects for investors. Broadcom shares currently trade for $1,592, putting them out of the reach of many investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all orchestrated stock splits in recent years. Let\u2019s look at seven companies that might be up next.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) seems to be an obvious choice among stocks that would benefit from a stock split. The company produces high-demand machines for which it is the only supplier globally. ASML can only produce a handful of the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines it manufactures on an annual basis.\n\nThe result is a very valuable firm and stock that has grown rapidly this year. ASML\u2019s EUV lithography machines are used to produce state-of-the-art semiconductors that have applications in artificial intelligence and other high-value sectors.\n\nDue to the extreme demand, ASML shares jumped from $700 in January to above $1,000 today. Those price increases haven\u2019t caused volume to decline but it makes sense for ASML to consider a stock split regardless: High-profile chip companies are splitting their stocks under the notion it will benefit their capital structure in the long run. ASML is a logical potential target to watch next for investors who believe in the power of stock splits.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is in my opinion one of the best combination stocks available to investors. The company is part emerging e-commerce champion, part rising fintech star. I\u2019m not the only one who appreciates MercadoLibre as it has become one of the more popular stocks overall. In the process, share prices have ballooned to spectacular highs and currently trade for nearly $1,700. If ever there were a stock in need of a split, MercadoLibre is it.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the company has maintained high prices for several years. That complicates the picture and suggests that the company may not implement a stock split. Prices approached $2,000 near the height of pandemic market madness. They dropped below $700 in the aftermath of austerity measures only to rise again to dizzying heights.\n\nAs with ASML, those high prices don\u2019t appear to be negatively affecting demand as measured by volume. That said, a stock split could prove to be the demand catalyst that MercadoLibre didn\u2019t know it needed.\n\nEven without a stock split, MercadoLibre stock should continue to impress based on its extremely strong fundamental growth.\n\nMicrostrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrostrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock represents a company less known for its enterprise analytics business than its Bitcoin (BTC-USD) holdings. The company has gained massive notoriety for its strong and continued investment into the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBy March 31, MicroStrategy had purchased $7.535 billion worth of Bitcoin, which was valued at $15.22 billion overall at the time. At that point the average cost paid by the company per Bitcoin was just above $35,000. Although Bitcoin prices have since cooled to $61,000, the company is clearly still in the black.\n\nMicroStrategy continues to accumulate more Bitcoin, recently adding an additional 11,931 BTC to its overall holdings.\n\nThe risky move seems to have paid off for the company, which is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin overall. Share prices have been pushed well above $1,000 in 2024. Arguably, the $1,000 threshold represents a strong psychological barrier for investors. Thus, Microstrategy is another potential target for a stock split.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nI bet the name Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) means very little to most stock investors. Very few people would know the company until they realize that it owns Hoka and Ugg.\n\nMany might then recognize the strength of the company as those brands are growing very fast. The company released its fourth quarter earnings report at the end of May showing sales grew by 21% during the period, reaching $959.8 million. The better-than-expected revenues led to per-share earnings of $4.95, more than $2 higher than analysts had anticipated. Sales of Hoka shoes accounted for $533 million in sales during the period, growing by 34%.\n\nDeckers Outdoor share prices are now approaching the $1,000 threshold. The stock sat in the $250 range two short years ago.\n\nDeckers Outdoor certainly doesn\u2019t need to implement a stock split in order to spike demand: The strength of Hoka and Ugg are doing more than enough. However, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to send a strong message to the market.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) could likely reach $1 trillion in market capitalization much quicker by implementing a stock split.\n\nThe company is currently the 10th most valuable stock as measured by market cap, with a value of $811 billion. The success of weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound has catapulted\u00a0 Eli Lilly into rarified air: pundits now expect Eli Lilly to reach $1 trillion in market cap at some point in the near future. It\u2019s likely Eli Lilly could reach that threshold quicker if it so chooses.\n\nAll the company has to do is to follow the lead of Nvidia, Broadcom, and others and announce a stock split. A similar 10-for-one split would give shareholders an additional nine shares for every share held and reduce prices to $90 per share.\n\nMany investors wonder whether a pharmaceutical firm is deserving of a $1 trillion valuation. A move by Eli Lilly to assert such confidence might be exactly what is needed.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) is another high-priced stock in the pharmaceutical sector. Currently, a share of REGN stock costs more than $1,000. While the company is nowhere near Eli Lilly in terms of market cap, both companies are potential stock split targets.\n\nA few things pop out about Regeneron Pharmaceuticals that suggest to me that a stock split makes a lot of sense. Simple arithmetic dictates that a 10-for-1 stock split results in updated share prices of approximately $100. That\u2019s an affordable share price that also suggests a lot of strength overall. However, the point I really want to make is that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals boasts per-share earnings of $33.86 over the trailing 12 months. Split by a factor of 10, that still results in impressive per-share earnings of $3.39.\n\nThe point here is that a lot of really strong companies develop monstrous fundamentals when successful. In the case of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals you could argue that EPS that high almost begs for a stock split.\n\nMettler-Toledo International (MTD) scientist wearing virtual reality headset interacts with futuristic holographic interface showing neurological data\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock\n\nMettler-Toledo International (NYSE:MTD) is perhaps the least likely stock on this list to enact a stock split in the near future. The healthcare firm provides diagnostics and research instruments primarily for the laboratory setting.\n\nThe reason I believe Mettler-Toledo International is probably the least likely company to enact a stock split is simple history. Share prices have consistently stayed above $1,000 since late 2020. Furthermore, healthcare stocks often trade for multiple hundreds of dollars and $1,000 is far from unheard of.\n\nAt the same time, a company like Mettler-Toledo International could choose to enact a stock split to drive demand. It would likely grab attention if done correctly. After all, healthcare stocks aren\u2019t exactly the flashiest investments. Point being, Mettler-Toledo International could differentiate itself through a stock split.\n\nIt too boasts strong trailing 12-month per-share earnings that could be split with the result being a remaining $3.57 EPS.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Cutting-Edge Tech Stocks to Supercharge Your Profits",
        "content": "Fundamentally, the bullish narrative for targeting cutting-edge tech stocks is rather straightforward. Outside of extraordinary circumstances, the innovation ecosystem always attempts to push society forward. Therefore, should you pick viable enterprises, you stand a better chance of accruing significant profits over the long run.\n\nEssentially, the concept undergirding cutting-edge tech stocks is permanently relevant. That doesn\u2019t mean that every idea selected from the broad tech umbrella will perform well. There are zero guarantees in the market and even robust and celebrated enterprises can always fail. That said, the unique backdrop of the current juncture makes individual innovators compelling.\n\nWith the advancement of artificial intelligence and related innovations, a surge of demand has entered the tech environment. Further, the resounding upside of names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have galvanized support among investors. Now, the focus has shifted toward alternative entities that can deliver the goods. On that note, below are cutting-edge tech stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest names among cutting-edge tech stocks, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plays a key role in multiple arenas. A significant money maker is the company\u2019s Azure platform, which is a leader in cloud-computing services. Further, Microsoft has invested heavily in AI, integrating digital intelligence across its products. It\u2019s also a huge name in the gig economy thanks to its Office 365 suite of business programs.\n\nWhat makes MSFT a particularly powerful player among cutting-edge tech stocks is predictability. Between the second quarter of 2023 and Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average earnings per share hit $2.82. This print translated to an average earnings surprise of 7%. Notably, it beat every bottom-line target for each of the past four quarters.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Microsoft posted net income of $86.18 billion or $11.53 per share. Revenue reached $236.58 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate over 20% expansion in EPS to $11.80. On the top line, they\u2019re targeting 15.6% growth to sales of $244.92 billion.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the top semiconductor manufacturing specialists, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) focuses on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These pieces of equipment are crucial for developing the most advanced computer chips. Essentially, the underlying technology enables operators to print intricate patterns on silicon wafers. Plus, ASML is unique \u2013 it\u2019s a one-of-a-kind enterprise, making it one of the top cutting-edge tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with Microsoft, ASML represents a predictable business. That\u2019s no surprise given its unique nature. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of $4.85. This print translated into an average earnings surprise of 8.2%. The company beat bottom-line targets in each of the past four quarters.\n\nDuring the TTM period, ASML posted net income of $7.11 billion or $19.25 per share. Revenue during the cycle hit $26.1 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts see mixed results, anticipating a slight dip in EPS and a very modest rise in revenue. However, fiscal 2025 could see a 56.5% leap in EPS to $32.21. Sales could soar 32.4% to hit $39.57 billion.\n\nHoneywell (HON) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t technically call Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) a pure-play example of cutting-edge tech stocks, the industrial conglomerate does feature a building controls business unit. Under this unit, Honeywell offers charging solutions for electric vehicles. Specifically, it markets its services to commercial real-estate operators looking to integrated EV charging to their properties.\n\nThat\u2019s compelling due to recent deals in the EV space. Basically, more automakers are focusing on securing demand from middle-income customers as opposed to affluent buyers. Well, long story short, a direct correlation exists between income and homeownership. And that means modest-income buyers will likely require public charging solutions. That\u2019s a huge plus for HON stock over the long run.\n\nPlus, Honeywell is a consistent player, beating its bottom-line targets in the past four quarters. Its average earnings surprise came out to 2.85%. For fiscal 2024, covering experts are looking for EPS to expand by 12.2% to reach $10.28. On the top line, they anticipate sales to rise by 5.6% to hit $38.7 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s not much growth but Honeywell also offers a forward yield of 2.02%.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) An image of a white, grey, and orange sign with the \"Intuitive Surgical\" logo and number \"1020\" on a patch of grass in front of a white, grey, and orange building on a sunny day.\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother name that\u2019s not quite a pure-play candidate for cutting-edge tech stocks, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) nevertheless deserves some consideration. Yes, it\u2019s more aligned with the healthcare sector. Intuitive develops and manufactures robotic products for minimally invasive surgeries. Ultimately, the underlying innovation should help improve patient outcomes. And that down the line benefits the broader economy.\n\nIndeed, society suffers when individuals \u2013 especially highly skilled and educated workers \u2013 must exit the assembly line (for lack of a better phrase) to take care of their health needs. So, minimizing the downtime is beneficial for the patient and society\u2019s bottom line. It\u2019s no surprise that Intuitive has been a consistent performer. In the past four quarters, its average EPS came out to nearly $1.50.\n\nFor the above print, the average earnings surprise was 6.2%. In the TTM period, Intuitive posted net income of $1.99 billion or $5.52 per share. Revenue reached $7.32 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for 10% EPS expansion to $6.29. On the top line, sales could hit $8.02 billion, up 12.6% from last year.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top names in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is vital to the wider economy. That\u2019s an easy statement to make because so much of business is conducted online and through cloud networks. It\u2019s critical to provide next-generation endpoint protection, which is CrowdStrike\u2019s specialty. It also offers threat intelligence and proactive threat hunting.\n\nWhile enterprises may be looking for costs to cut, cybersecurity may survive the budgeting axe. That\u2019s because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, especially in the digital age. Not surprisingly, CrowdStrike has been a stellar performer over the past four quarters, generating an average EPS of 86 cents. This print translated to an earnings surprise of 15.83%.\n\nIn the TTM period, the cybersecurity specialist posted net income of $131.66 million or 54 cents per share. Revenue reached $3.28 billion. For the current fiscal year, experts are seeking 29.4% growth in EPS to $4. On the top line, sales may see a 30.8% boost to $4 billion. It\u2019s easily one of the cutting-edge tech stocks to consider.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nMoving over to the riskier side of cutting-edge tech stocks, C3.ai (NYSE:AI) specializes in enterprise-level AI. It develops software applications for multiple industries along with government agencies. One of its main attributes is that it provides mechanisms for predictive maintenance. That can be especially crucial for both civilian and military uses, impacting safety and operational integrity.\n\nFurther, what makes C3.ai appealing to speculators is that the underlying innovation enables practical uses of AI to foster productivity. Still, it\u2019s a risky idea, with shares in red ink over a 52-week basis. Further, the company isn\u2019t profitable, producing a loss per share of 11.5 cents in the past four quarters. That said, the quarterly surprise during this period came out to just under 48%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, C3.ai posted a net loss of $279.7 million or $2.34 per share in the red. Revenue in the cycle reached $310.58 million. For the current fiscal year, analysts believe the loss per share may unfavorably widen by nearly 15% to 54 cents. However, sales could see a 23.4% jump to $383.39 million.\n\nVeritone (VERI) AI stocks to buy now, Graphic of letters \"AI\" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark background. ai stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Tex vector\n\nBased in Irvine, California, Veritone (NASDAQ:VERI) is an AI technology firm. Its main call to fame is its platform called aiWARE, which integrates AI solutions to process, transform and analyze audio, video and text data in real-time. In particular, media and entertainment agencies utilize Veritone\u2019s services for content creation, management and monetization.\n\nWith so much material moving to online platforms, Veritone could be able to carve out a powerful niche. However, the problem is volatility. After soaring to blistering heights in April this year, VERI stock has plunged badly. Therefore, it\u2019s undoubtedly a speculative entity. It\u2019s not profitable either, producing a loss per share of 23 cents over the past four quarters.\n\nIn the TTM period, Veritone incurred a net loss of $60.86 million or $1.63 per share. Revenue during the period reached $128.93 million. For fiscal 2024, experts do see a significant improvement in the loss per share to 35 cents. That\u2019s a far cry from $1.01 in the red. Also, revenue may pop 8.1% to hit $137.9 million.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "One way to analyze investments in a particular industry or sector is by understanding the supply chain. Dig deep into a given industry and the power players will soon emerge. In the case of artificial intelligence (AI), there are a handful of best stocks that also currently appear to have long-term viability. Exposure to the best AI supply chain stocks is likely to be a winning strategy.\n\nEach of these firms forms a vital link in the overall AI supply chain. The integral nature of these firms and their apparent long-term viability makes each an excellent choice for any investor seeking long-term exposure to the AI boom.\n\nThe long-term outlook for AI certainly looks strong. The overall value of the AI market rose from $50 billion in 2023 to $184 billion in 2024. It\u2019s expected to surge to $826 billion by 2030. That projected growth should translate into massive opportunities in each of the stocks discussed below. Each of those companies has an incredible opportunity to grow at an unprecedented rate.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock has grown quickly in 2024, surging from $100 to $175 today. That would raise some eyebrows normally but for investors worried I would look to current target prices.\n\nTarget prices range from a low of $168 to a high of $200. That seems to be a reflection of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s new reality. It is responsible for the manufacturing of 90% of the world\u2019s cutting-edge logic chips. That means 90% of the AI chips that get stamped with names like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are produced by TSM.\n\nThe company is one of the most integral links within the AI supply chain and it seems that more and more people are recognizing it these days.\n\nIt also looks like TSM is soon going to be charging many of its partners higher prices. The company has seen how much money Nvidia has been making and has suggested charging the company more. Nvidia seems to be on board with the reasoning, suggesting that price hikes will trickle down to other suppliers as well.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA logo on phone and blurred AI chip on the background. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nMention AI and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is almost certainly going to be the first name to come to mind. Nvidia has become synonymous with AI and for good reason. Over the past few years, the company has gone from one that derived most of its revenues from GPUs for computers to one driving the majority of its revenues from AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nApproximately 80% of Nvidia\u2019s $22.1 billion in first-quarter revenues were attributable to AI-related hardware. The shift has prompted not only massive overall growth at the company but also is indicative of Nvidia\u2019s AI prowess.\n\nCompanies of all sizes continue to scramble to secure their portion of Nvidia\u2019s chips. Those chips are in such high demand that Nvidia simply can\u2019t keep up. That\u2019s not such a bad place to be when it comes to pricing power but ultimately Nvidia would like to sell to all willing buyers I\u2019m guessing.\n\nShares continue to test new highs following the forward stock split. It will be surprising to no one if Nvidia soon sneaks above $140 and stays there.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is another of the most important AI stocks and one all investors should consider. The company produces advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that is state of the art.\n\nASML\u2019s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines are essential for the manufacture of the most advanced chips. The bus-sized machines etch electronic pathways onto silicon wafers. ASML is the only company in the world that can make those machines. Other firms have mastered deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography employing longer wavelengths of light but the result is wider wafer pathways.\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) purchased all five of the High NA EUV lithography machines ASML is slated to produce this year. Those machines are each valued at $370 million. That should give readers an idea of the value of ASML\u2019s technological capabilities.\n\nThe process of how patterns are etched onto silicon wafers it\u2019s extremely technical and interesting and includes a step in which a droplet of tin is heated to 220,000\u00b0 Celsius and optical systems that include the most accurate mirrors ever fabricated.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Wealthiest People in Netherlands, and in this article we will look at the richest individual.\n\nThe Future of the Dutch Economy\n\nAccording to a report by the European Union, the Netherlands reported slow economic growth in 2023, due to a decline in private consumption and exports. The Dutch economy is expected to reach a growth rate of 0.8% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025 due to an increase in real wages, which are expected to have a positive effect on consumer and government spending. On the other hand, business investment in the Netherlands is expected to remain weak and sluggish due to declining business confidence and labor shortage. While the labor market is still slow, it seems to be easing as available vacancies are expected to surpass the number of unemployed people in the country. The unemployment rate is expected to reach 3.9% in 2024 and 4% in 2025. Wage growth, on the other hand, may reach 5.9% in 2024 and 3.8% by 2025. While the Dutch economy corrected itself in the first quarter of 2024, skilled labor shortage in tech and science will remain a primary concern for companies and employers. You can also take a look at the wealthiest people in South Korea.\n\nThe Climate in the Netherlands' Semiconductor Industry\n\nOn March 6, Reuters reported that semiconductor startups in the Netherlands are receiving increasing funding from the Economic Affairs Ministry to improve tech entrepreneurship. Venture capital for chip startups reached EUR 216 million ($231 million) in 2023, growing for the fifth consecutive year. As per the report, Dutch startups are more likely to be acquired before they reach a valuation of EUR 1 billion ($1.07 billion), as compared to startups in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. To counter this, the Dutch government is focusing on improving its university-level research and increasing funding for deep tech companies. You can also read our piece on the wealthiest people in Germany.\n\nDue to its stringent business policies, the Dutch government is currently dealing with mistrust from companies. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) dominates the lithography business and is an important stakeholder in the Dutch economy. On March 6, Reuters reported that the Dutch government was in talks with ASML Holding, requesting it to not leave the country, as the company considers pursuing growth strategies abroad amid rising demand for chips. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is the largest tech company in the Netherlands and is crucial for the tech advancements in the country. Previously Unilever and Shell left the country due to stringent tax laws, which increases the threat of ASML Holdings leaving the Netherlands as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the flipside, on May 23, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and the Eindhoven University of Technology agreed to spend EUR 180 billion ($192.5 billion) on semiconductor research in the coming decade. While the company has been struggling with its expansion plans and meeting global demand, the initiative will increase the availability of PhDs and scientific research in the chip industry. The university plans to allocate EUR 100 billion ($107 billion) to run an advanced cleanroom facility for semiconductor research in physics, mechatronics, optics, and AI. ASML Holdings on the other hand will be investing EUR 80 billion ($85.6 billion). Previously in March, the Dutch government shared its plans to invest $2.7 billion in Project Beethoven, to improve housing, roads, and electric grids to ensure the semiconductor equipment giant does not move operations abroad.\n\nOne of the Largest Companies in the Netherlands\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is currently the world's biggest chip equipment maker. The company provides equipment to some of the largest chipmakers in the world, to make chips smaller, faster, and more sustainable. The company makes extreme ultraviolet lithography systems and deep ultraviolet lithography systems. It provides companies with hardware and software services to produce mass silicon using lithography machines. Its latest NXT machines can run over 6,000 wafers every day, a productivity rate increase of 5% over the past 12 months. ASML Holding's (NASDAQ:ASML) dry NXT system, TWINSCAN NXT:1470, is the first platform in the industry to produce more than 300 wafers per hour. Overall, the TWINSCAN product line produces 200 mm and 300 mm wafers, increasing productivity in the IoT, automotive, and industrial markets.\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) reported EUR 5.3 billion ($5.7 billion) in sales during the first quarter of 2024. Of those, EUR 1.8 billion ($1.93 billion) came from the sale of 12 extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems and EUR 4 billion ($4.28 billion) came from net system sales. 63% of net system sales came from logic and 37% were driven from memory. The company spent EUR 1.32 billion ($1.4 billion) on research and development during the first quarter of 2024, and net income reached EUR 1.2 billion ($1.28 billion), 23.1% of total sales. Net bookings in Q1 2024 were EUR 3.6 billion ($3.85 billion), of which EUR 656 million ($701.6 million) came from EUV bookings. In the last six months, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) logged EUR 13 billion ($13.9 billion) in net bookings and expects sales to range between EUR 5.7 billion ($6.1 billion) and EUR 6.2 billion ($6.6 billion) in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAhead of 2024, the company expects strong revenue growth for its EUV business. On the other hand, It expects logic revenue to report sluggish growth as customers get acquainted with its new lithography capacity developed in the past year. On June 3, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Imec announced the launch of a High NA EUV Lithography Lab in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. The lab is run by both parties involved. It has been under development and training for years and is now capable of providing memory chip makers and materials and equipment suppliers access to its prototype of the High NA EUC scanner along with processing and metrology tools. The lab will enable high-volume manufacturing of High NA EUV between 2025 and 2026. The scanner helps all stakeholders get acquainted with the new technology and develop high NA EUV use cases supporting them in their production fabs. The scanner will drastically improve the patterning ecosystem pushing High NA EUV to new heights.\n\nOverall the business climate of the Netherlands may be uncertain, however, companies like ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) are crucial to the success of the country. Despite current headwinds, the company expects sales to reach EUR 44 billion ($47.06 billion) to EUR 60 billion ($64.17 billion) by 2030, doubling from EUR 26.7 ($28.6 billion) billion in 2023.

        "title": "Too Late to Buy Nvidia? 3 Stocks to Double Down on Instead.",
        "content": "Is the AI rally over for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? The dominant AI chipmaker has fallen 10% from its all-time high and has now slipped back to the third most valuable stock on the market behind Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nInvestors, though, should probably just view it as the pause that refreshes. Nvidia stock is just taking a breather before its next run higher. With CEO Jensen Huang declaring \u201cwe are at the beginning of a new industrial revolution\u201d due to corporate demand for AI, there will be no let up in Nvidia\u2019s growth potential.\n\nYet, because the stock still trades at 71 times trailing earnings, 33 times next year\u2019s estimates and 37 times sales, Nvidia is not cheap. If you missed the run-up in the chipmaker\u2019s stock (sheepishly raises hand), don\u2019t worry. There are still other AI stocks to buy instead of Nvidia that can generate outsized returns for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat is why you just might want to double down on three stocks below. They might not generate 3,000% returns in five years as NVDA stock did but that doesn\u2019t mean you can create fabulous wealth with these AI stocks today.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first choice for any investor looking for AI stocks to buy instead of Nvidia would have to be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). It is the one chipmaker perfectly positioned to challenge the industry leader, and in many respects is already doing so.\n\nIn just the two months since AMD released its AI-driven MI300X accelerator for data centers, the chipmaker already generated some $1.5 billion in sales. That\u2019s not Nvidia-level revenue but AMD is only just getting started.\u00a0 Data center revenue surged 80% in the first quarter, jumping to $2.3 billion from the year-ago period causing segment operating profits to more than triple to $541 million.\n\nAnd not content to rest on its laurels, Advanced Micro already has the next iteration of the accelerator ready to go. In the fourth quarter the chipmaker will release the Instinct MI325X accelerator that will take its AI capabilities to the next level.\n\nA lot of AMD\u2019s growth will occur in the back half of the year. The semiconductor stock forecasts data center revenue will exceed $4 billion in 2024, up from its previous guidance of $3.5 billion. And the company is stealing market share from both Nvidia and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). It owns one-third of the market and it is quickly padding its share.\n\nExpect Advanced Micro Devices stock to accelerate growth later this year and then continue a meteoric rise thereafter.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nThe reason Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is the second AI stock to buy instead of Nvidia is because it is the chip foundry from where Nvidia gets its chips. If there is any company that will grow alongside the AI chip stock best it is TSM.\n\nMoreover, all the leading AI semiconductor manufacturers get their chips from Taiwan Semi, including Advanced Micro and Intel. The company has so much demand for its services that it can\u2019t keep up with it and has had to expand manufacturing capacity. There are three new chip facilities planned to come online in the U.S. over the next few years.\n\nI\u2019ve always liked picks-and-shovels-type investments. They are the behind-the-scenes stocks that allow you to avoid trying to pick the winners and losers. They are willing to sell to anyone wanting to pan for gold, so whichever stock emerges victorious they benefit from it and the others. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is just such a play, though arguably not in the same sense as most people think of these stocks.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue jumped 13% to $18.9 billion with rich profit margins across the board. Gross margins were 53%, operating margins were 42.1% and net margins came in at 38%.\n\nThe stock has doubled in value over the past year. Yet as AI demand maintains it white-hot pace look for TSM to achieve a trillion-dollar valuation of its own.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nI tend to not invest in exchange-traded funds (ETF) but in the same vein as Taiwan Semi is a picks-and-shovels stock on the AI chip trade, VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) is a top AI stock to buy instead of Nvidia. Or rather, you will be buying Nvidia and all the other AI chip stocks out there.\n\nWith ETFs, of course, you\u2019re buying a basket of companies. Just like TSM, you\u2019re not trying to pick winners and losers but buying all the players (generally speaking). It doesn\u2019t matter who wins because there will be many winners and VanEck Semiconductor will likely hold them all.\n\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia is SMH\u2019s largest holding, comprising 19.4% of the portfolio. The next biggest is TSM at 12.8% but it also owns hard-charging Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) (7.9%), Advanced Micro (5.2%) and clean equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) (4.8%).\n\nIn reality, any of those stocks would be a good AI stock to buy instead of Nvidia. But why worry that one will stumble? Just buy them up all at once with VanEck Semi. It has a relatively low expense ratio of 0.43% and has generated returns this year exceeding 48%. A $1,000 investment three years ago would be worth over $2,060 today, and would have been achieved at lower risk.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Finding potential trillion-dollar companies is a calculated risk that may significantly improve an investor\u2019s portfolio. The encouraging development paths of three businesses are on track to accomplish this goal. Investors hoping to profit from rising market leaders must comprehend the principles underlying these businesses\u2019 success. These businesses excel in cloud services, are leaders in semiconductor technology and have creative methods to integrate AI. These accomplishments underscore the strategic ambitions driving these businesses.\n\nHere is a thorough review of these firms\u2019 fundamentals, including their financial stability and strategic initiatives. The analysis explores why they are strong candidates for trillion-dollar values in the future. With an emphasis on identifying critical growth drivers and market positioning in pursuing future trillion-dollar stocks, the insights provided here\u00a0are intended\u00a0to provide readers with the knowledge necessary to make wise investment decisions. These businesses can be valued at trillions of dollars as they represent the tech industry\u2019s dynamic character and high potential for financial gain.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The logo for Oracle Corp (ORCL) is seen on the side of a tall glass building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers enterprise software and cloud services. In Q4 fiscal 2024, the company\u2019s financials point to strong growth potential. This is\u00a0especially\u00a0derived from its cloud services business. Oracle saw a considerable boost in cloud revenue in Q4 with total cloud revenue up 20% to $5.3 billion.\u00a0Indeed, solid leads in the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and software as a service (SaaS) sectors led to this expansion. Notably, IaaS sales increased by 42% to $2 billion. Meanwhile, SaaS revenue increased by 10% to $3.3 billion, which\u00a0reflects Oracle\u2019s successful execution in meeting market demand for its cloud products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, despite the overall sales increase, the company\u2019s cloud services and licensing support division had a 77% gross margin. It is a positive trend towards higher-margin cloud services. In Q4, non-GAAP operating income increased to $6.7 billion, up 9% from last year\u2019s period. Additionally, the operating margin increased from 47% to 44%. This enhancement demonstrates Oracle\u2019s capacity to develop its business effectively even as cloud revenues rise.\n\nTo conclude, Oracle\u2019s significant growth in cloud revenue highlights its robust positioning among future trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) is an edge semiconductor manufacturing technology. The business\u2019s strong backlog and order book further support its upward trajectory. Net system bookings in Q1 2024 were 3.6 billion euros, with the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system accounting for a sizable portion of those bookings at 656 million euros. The sustained demand demonstrates trust in ASML\u2019s technological plan and tactical placement in the semiconductor supply chain. By the end of Q1 2024, ASML had over 38 billion euro in backlog.\u00a0This\u00a0gives it significant insight into future sales and a robust platform for continued top-line growth.\n\nAdditionally, the business planned to invest around\u00a01.7 billion euro in Q2 2024, having committed 1.32 billion euro to research in Q1 2024. The primary goal of these expenditures is the development of EUV technology. Furthermore, ASML is positioned favorably for future growth cycles because of its proactive capacity ramp-up and strategic material intake.\u00a0Hence, this\u00a0highlights the company\u2019s ability to satisfy rising demand as global fabs develop.\n\nOverall, with a\u00a0strong backlog and substantial investments in research, ASML may hit increasing global demand and maintain its presence on the future trillion-dollar stocks list.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) leads in the semiconductor industry. AMD derived strong sales growth in the client division, up 85% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Strong demand for its Ryzen 8000 series CPUs was the main factor driving this growth. In particular, AMD\u2019s Ryzen Pro 8000 processors, meant for use in commercial PCs, have garnered positive feedback due to their embedded AI accelerators.\n\nFurther, strategic alliances with top original equipment manufacturers have made it easier to introduce new products and get people to use\u00a0AMD-powered devices. AMD\u2019s focus on meeting the need for AI-driven computing solutions\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in its partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and more than 150 independent software suppliers (ISVs) creating software for AMD AI PCs. Thus, AMD may use AI\u2019s adoption prospects across the PC ecosystem to increase its revenue share as the industry prepares for a possible growth cycle in 2024.\n\nTo sum up, AMD\u2019s focus on integrating AI capabilities into its Ryzen processors and strategic partnerships make it a prime candidate among future trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in ASML and AMD.

        "content": "At the time of writing, there are precisely seven trillion dollar stocks overall. One of them, Saudi Aramco, doesn\u2019t trade in US markets. Thus, there are effectively six trillion dollar stocks to buy currently available to most U.S. investors.\n\nThree of those six trillion-dollar stocks are each valued at more than $3 trillion. Those respective companies have grown in value rapidly, particularly due to the ongoing emergence of artificial intelligence.\n\nAI will likely continue to play a major role in the emergence of the next trillion-dollar stocks. However, there is clear potential for other trillion-dollar companies to emerge from other sectors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe continuing development and FDA approval of weight loss drugs is another massive opportunity to watch. Sales continue to grow rapidly and the global weight loss drugs market is expected to grow at nearly 50% annually between 2024 and 2029. That rapid growth promises to potentially create the next trillion-dollar stocks. There are lots of reasons for optimism overall, so let\u2019s get into the stocks themselves.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf AI is the next big thing, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) certainly has to be among the top picks for the next trillion dollar stocks. It is estimated that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing makes 92% of the world\u2019s most sophisticated chips.\n\nIn other words, it has a hand in the production of all of the chips from the very biggest companies in the world from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on down. It is indispensable to the AI opportunity.\n\nThe company also intends to charge Nvidia more for the chips it provides the firm. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems to be on board with the price hike, stating that TSMC delivers value. The point here is that TSMC\u2019s top-line performance is likely to improve moving forward given how integral it is to the entire chip sector.\n\nBeyond that, TSMC is already quite close to the $1 trillion market cap threshold. As I write this article, the company\u2019s market cap sits at $931 billion. If TSM stock reaches its high target price of $200, its market will push above $1 trillion.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock currently boasts a market cap of approximately $850 billion. It is currently expected that Eli Lilly will be worth $4 trillion in a few short years. $1 trillion seems to be a foregone conclusion.\n\nIf LLY stock reaches its high target price, it will rise above $1 trillion in value. Eli Lilly reported $34.12 billion in revenues in all of 2023. The company expects to report more than $70 billion in revenues by 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the current hurdles facing Eli Lilly is simply reinvesting revenues back into manufacturing in order to meet soaring demand for GLP-1 agonist drugs. Nevertheless, the company doesn\u2019t expect to be able to meet demand in 2024 and perhaps even in 2025. The point here is that Eli Lilly shares have strong growth catalysts to look forward to. Media outlets consistently wondered aloud whether a pharmaceutical company could ever be valued at $1 trillion. Eli Lilly is certainly going to get there, and probably first.\n\nInvestors should pay particular attention to the development of an oral weight loss drug. That delivery modality is much preferable to injections.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has to be high on the list of any investor seeking the next trillion-dollar stock to buy. It continues to emerge as one of the best AI shares for investors to consider.\n\nThe company released earnings on June 12 which contained a few important pieces of information. One, revenues were better than anticipated. Broadcom indicated that AI was responsible for the better-than-expected results. In the same report, Broadcom also announced a 10-for-one forward stock split.\n\n10-for-one forward stock splits are becoming a popular tool for high-priced tech stocks. Nvidia recently enacted such a stock split with very positive results. Its valuation has soared above $3 trillion, partially due to the positive effects of that split.\n\nAVGO share prices have risen from $1,495 to $1,802 in the week following the announcement. Split-adjusted trading will begin on July 15. One of the interesting things to pay attention to is whether the high target price will be adjusted from its current level of $2,050 to $205. Or, will it be adjusted above $205 to account for the effects of affordability on demand?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) stands out as the only share on this list which is neither a tech nor a pharmaceutical stock.\n\nIt\u2019s also arguably the safest stock on this list. The company and its shares benefit from the long-term value created by the Warren Buffett investment strategy. It\u2019s a strategy that relies on identifying durable competitive advantages found by scouring the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statements of companies, primarily in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s the opposite of finding the next big opportunity and instead identifying special companies that are already well-established but underappreciated.\n\nThe slow and steady approach creates predictability which is manifest in the steady market cap growth of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe company\u2019s valuation has grown from roughly $550 billion at the onset of the pandemic to nearly $900 billion today. Likely, Berkshire Hathaway will soon enter $1 trillion market cap territory. It\u2019s probably the best choice for investors who don\u2019t want to ride the emotional roller coaster that tech and pharma stocks are likely to offer while approaching $1 trillion.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building. NVO stock\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) stock is approximately 63% of the way to the one trillion club. Put another way, its market cap is $630 billion currently.\n\nNovo Nordisk is well-known today because of the emergence and FDA approval of weight loss drugs. Ozempic, of course, is one of the leading FDA-approved weight loss drugs which has made NVO stock very valuable.\n\nWhile the weight loss market opportunity continues to be huge and will certainly propel Novo Nordisk higher, the opportunity is much bigger. Ozempic and other formulations of the active ingredient semaglutide have wide-ranging efficacy for several costly and prevalent health conditions. The company announced the presentation of data related to semaglutide for conditions including diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease on June 18.\n\nThe value of Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock appears to go well beyond the current weight loss opportunity. Instead, it extends deeply into several of the most costly health conditions globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Novo Nordisk continues to develop an orally administered obesity pill called amycretin. There\u2019s certainly a huge untapped pool of demand for early administered obesity pills. The potential of that drug is another reason to assume Novo Nordisk is almost certain to eclipse the $1 trillion market cap threshold sooner or later.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is a lot like TSMC: Both stocks are dominant forces in the global semiconductor supply chain but are not nearly as well known as Nvidia, for example.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s plenty of reason to believe investors should place as much money in ASML as Nvidia. It all boils down to the fact that ASML is indispensable to the current AI opportunity.\n\nThe company has a monopoly on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine sector. Those machines are integral to the production of the most powerful chips used in AI and elsewhere. ASML is the only company in the space for the most part. The company\u2019s EUV revenues have increased 9X over the last seven years and are expected to exceed legacy system sales this year.\n\nRevenues are also expected to double between 2023 and 2028. ASML has a current market cap of approximately $420 billion. Given projected revenue growth, it\u2019s likely that the company will eclipse $1 trillion in market cap at some point in the next handful of years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has the farthest to go to reach one trillion of any of the stocks listed on this list. It is currently valued at $250 billion by market cap so it will have to quadruple in price to reach that level.\n\nRealistically speaking, it doesn\u2019t appear that will occur very soon. AMD reported approximately $22.7 billion in revenues in all of 2023. Those revenues are anticipated to double by 2027. So, logically speaking, there\u2019s no reason to believe the company\u2019s market cap will quadruple during the same period. That said, AMD\u2019s earnings growth is expected to be strong this year and through 2027. It should contribute to making share prices more than double. Thus, I do expect share prices to more than double during that period.\n\nSimply put, AMD should be the beneficiary of rapidly improving internal economics during that time frame.\n\nAgain, I still don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough to quadruple its share price within that time. But perhaps AMD will prove capable of bringing some unforeseen innovation to the AI chip space in that period. If so, AMD has every chance of quadrupling during that time frame.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Tech Stocks to Buy Without Any Hesitation",
        "content": "Tech stocks are hot right now. The S&P 500 is near its all-time high and megacap tech stocks dominate the index. Additionally, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index is just days away from its all-time high. Any way you look at it, it's a good time to be a tech investor.\n\nThis party won't last forever, though, and a pullback in tech stocks is inevitable at some point. This is why it's a smart strategy to identify the strongest businesses in the sector and put some investment dollars into them. Every stock slides at some point, but the stronger the underlying business, the quicker the recovery should be. With that in mind, here are three tech stocks you can buy without hesitation.\n\nASML\n\nDutch manufacturer ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) builds the lithography machines that are necessary to manufacture semiconductor chips. These machines cost hundreds of millions of dollars apiece and are the size of large shipping containers. For the most cutting-edge chip manufacturing, extreme ultraviolet lithography machines are necessary, and ASML is the only company in the world capable of supplying them.\n\nIn Q1, ASML's revenue fell by 22% year over year to 5.3 billion euros. For some companies, that sort of slide in revenue might be concerning, but the semiconductor industry is still in a cyclical downturn (despite all the artificial intelligence headlines), and this revenue result was expected by ASML.\n\nWhat's important is that ASML is continuing to invest heavily during this industry down cycle so it can be ready when the cycle swings back upward. Management views 2024 as a transition year, and expects to see a return to growth in 2025.\n\nDatadog\n\nBusiness software company Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG) helps businesses keep track of their computer systems, applications, and cloud services to ensure they're running smoothly. It does this through an integrated platform that removes the traditional silos that keep various aspects of monitoring separate from one another.\n\nFor investors who may not work in a field where this kind of software is necessary, the importance of this kind of software might not be immediately obvious. However, Datadog's results tell a clear story. In Q1, its revenue grew by 27% year over year, its bottom line improved from a loss of $0.08 per share to earnings of $0.12 per share, and the company generated $187 million in free cash flow.\n\nInvestors should keep an eye on Datadog's customer metrics. The number of customers contributing $100,000 or more in annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased by 15% in the quarter, and almost half of its customers now use four or more of its products. It takes less money to get current customers to spend more than it does to attract new customers, so as these metrics grow, its profitability should follow.\n\nStory continues\n\nServiceNow\n\nServiceNow(NYSE: NOW) sells software to enterprise customers that helps manage things like information technology, human resources, and customer service management. As with Datadog, because these products are not consumer-facing, their value and importance can be overlooked. But here too, the company's results should help investors understand just how critical these products can be.\n\nWhat sticks out about ServiceNow is how impressive its results have been over long periods. Consider revenue, net income, and free cash flow over the last five years. NOW Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nManagement expects this type of growth to continue. In its Q1 earnings report, the company raised the low end of its full-year revenue guidance and expects growth to be approximately 22%. It is guiding for a free cash flow margin of 31%. Consistency is what has made ServiceNow one of the best tech stocks to own over the past decade, and there's no evidence that it's poised to slow down in the near term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Executed a 10-for-1 Stock Split. 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could be Next.",
        "content": "Nvidia stock soared to record highs following its 10-for-1 split. Following that increase, it became the stock with the world's largest market cap. Another chip giant, Broadcom, is far from such an achievement but has shot higher since announcing its own split.\n\nGiven those reactions, such a move could be next for other AI stocks that announce stock splits. The question for investors is which stocks will make such a move. While the answer to that question remains to be seen, a similar increase could happen for the following stocks:\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) should emerge as a stock-split candidate. Despite a worldwide reach and a stock that has traded since 2007, it was a server manufacturer largely unknown outside its industry.\n\nThat changed when it and Nvidia announced a partnership. Consequently, Supermicro stock has outperformed Nvidia's over the last year. SMCI Chart\n\nThe increase briefly took its share price above $1,000 in March, and despite the surge, it could be undervalued.\n\nThanks to revenue growth estimated to reach 110% this year, analysts forecast nearly $24 per share in net income. That is quite a feat, considering that its share price was $24 as recently as four years ago.\n\nDespite that increase, Supermicro's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 52, which is a low valuation given the growth rate. That growth and the possible catalyst of a lower nominal share price after a split could be what Supermicro needs to keep moving higher.\n\nASML\n\nASML(NASDAQ: ASML) remains a relatively unknown semiconductor stock. Nonetheless, it is one of the most crucial chip companies because it builds the most advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines.\n\nHence, manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung need its machines to make their cutting-edge chips.\n\nMoreover, countries want to move more manufacturing away from Taiwan, the island that produces about two-thirds of the world's chips. That fear has led to tens of billions in subsidies going into ASML's industry.\n\nThe AI-driven demand for chips has become a boon to ASML as chip fabricators scramble to increase capacity. Investors looking to capitalize on the AI boom have bid its stock price higher, and it is up more than 430% over the last five years, taking its stock price to around $1,050 as of this writing.\n\nThe run-up has taken the P/E to a lofty 54. Nonetheless, the demand for EUV machines likely means its long-term growth continues, and a split in the near future improves the chances of ASML moving higher in the short term as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAs one of the largest cloud providers, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) plays a key role in running AI applications. It was one of the companies that built an alliance with OpenAI, whose ChatGPT platform makes it a more crucial AI company.\n\nThat led investors to bid the stock price higher by more than 30% over the last year, giving Microsoft the world's largest market cap for most of the year.\n\nAmid its rising value, the company still trades at around $450 per share, which might not inspire most companies to split shares in today's market.\n\nHowever, investors often forget that it is one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Since that is a price-weighted index, a higher nominal price gives Microsoft a disproportionate influence over the Dow. Thus, the index tends to pressure its members to split their stocks when the price becomes high.\n\nGiven the bump that benefited Nvidia and Broadcom, such pressure could be a blessing in disguise. A stock split could give Microsoft investors a reason to bid its stock higher despite its 39 P/E ratio, possibly meaning a split will happen sooner rather than later.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "SMH ETF: Exposure to Nvidia and Other Top Chip Stocks",
        "content": "It\u2019s hard to look past Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) these days, but it\u2019s important to remember that there are also plenty of other great semiconductor (chip) stocks out there. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) enables investors to gain exposure to both Nvidia and other attractive opportunities within the semiconductor space.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on SMH based on its strong portfolio of top semiconductor stocks, which are performing well and harbor significant long-term growth potential, as well as its incredible track record of generating strong returns for its holders. We\u2019ve covered SMH previously; it has performed well since then and continues to look like a compelling opportunity for the long term.\n\nWhat Is the SMH ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nSMH is the largest dedicated semiconductor ETF.\u00a0According to sponsor VanEck, SMH invests in the\u00a0\u201cMVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index (MVSMHTR), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment.\u201d\n\nVanEck highlights the fact that these are highly liquid stocks, industry leaders, and companies with global scale.\n\nPortfolio of Compelling Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSMH owns 26 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 76.2% of the fund.\u00a0Below, you\u2019ll find an overview of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nWhile the fund isn\u2019t particularly diversified, it gives investors substantial exposure to Nvidia (which has a large weighting of 24.6%) and other top semiconductor stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and more.\n\nWere it not for Nvidia\u2019s 209.6% gain over the past year, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019d be hearing more about Broadcom and its 111.8% gain. But the semiconductor and software infrastructure giant is now knocking on the door of becoming one of the world\u2019s 10 largest companies and is worthy of plenty of attention on its own accord. The stock is a long-term winner that has generated an incredible total return of 3,168% over the past decade.\n\nIt\u2019s also an underrated dividend growth stock that has increased its dividend payout for 13 straight years and grown this payout at an impressive 17.5% CAGR over the past five years. Additionally, like Nvidia, Broadcom has a stock split of its own coming up.\n\nThe company recently announced that it will execute a 10-for-1 stock split, which will go live on July 12th. While stock splits don\u2019t necessarily make a fundamental difference, they can drive considerable interest and momentum in a stock, as we recently saw with Nvidia. They can also make the stock more accessible to smaller investors and retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to Broadcom, Taiwan Semiconductor is another one of the many attractive chip stocks among SMH\u2019s top holdings.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world\u2019s largest and most advanced chipmaker. Leading semiconductor companies like the aforementioned Nvidia, Broadcom, Qualcomm, and others go to Taiwan Semiconductor to manufacture the cutting-edge chips that they design and develop. This makes Taiwan Semiconductor an attractive picks-and-shovels play within the semiconductor space. The $786.1 billion company has seen its stock gain a cool 75.2% over the past year and hit a new all-time high.\n\nNext, Qualcomm, which is up 93.8% over the past year, has made a name for itself, as the company is developing cutting-edge semiconductors for everything from smartphones to automobiles and Internet of Things devices.\n\nAdditional top 10 holdings, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), are among the few companies in the world providing the high-tech tools and equipment that are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process, making them crucial parts of the semiconductor value chain with wide moats (competitive advantages).\n\nOne thing that Broadcom, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Qualcomm all have in common is that they all feature \u201cPerfect 10\u201d Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Seven of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above.\n\nAdditionally, SMH boasts an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8.\n\nSensational Long-Term Performance\n\nSMH owns a strong collection of highly-rated semiconductor stocks, and it has also generated excellent returns for its holders for a long time, giving it a track record that\u2019s hard to beat.\n\nAs of May 31, SMH has delivered an enviable annualized three-year return of 25.5%. This stellar return easily trumps that of the broader market. The Vanguard S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:VOO) returned 9.6% on an annualized basis over the same time frame. It even beats the strong performance of the tech-focused Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK), which delivered an annualized return of 15.9% over the same time span.\n\nOver a longer five-year timeframe, SMH has generated a scorching annualized return of 38.6%. This number again handily beats the broader market and XLK (VOO returned an annualized 15.8% over the same time frame, while XLK returned an annualized 25.2%). Note that these are both great returns, and SMH still beat them by a considerable margin.\n\nEven going back 10 years, SMH has produced a phenomenal annualized return of 27.8%, again beating both the broader market and the tech-focused XLK. VOO returned an annualized 12.7% over the same time frame, while XLK returned an annualized 20.3%.\n\nHow High Is SMH\u2019s Expense Ratio?\n\nSMH features a reasonable expense ratio of 0.35%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $35 on a $10,000 investment annually.\u00a0This isn\u2019t the lowest fee out there, as many broad market index funds charge lower fees. However, it is on par with its peers and reasonable enough for a sector-specific ETF, especially one that is performing as well as SMH.\n\nIs SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $285.18 implies 7.5% upside potential from current levels.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019m bullish on SMH because it provides investors substantial exposure to Nvidia and top semiconductor stocks like Broadcom, Taiwan Semiconductor, and others. Plus, its phenomenal returns over the past three, five, and 10 years give it an unassailable track record.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "While it\u2019s easy to get locked into semiconductor stocks to buy thanks to the mercurial rise of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), there\u2019s more to the sector than just one enterprise focused on artificial intelligence. Fundamentally, the chip-manufacturing ecosystem is enticing because it represents the building blocks of innovation.\n\nWith progress always pointing in one direction \u2013 forward \u2013 investors ought to concentrate the growth portion side of their portfolio on semiconductor stocks to buy. Basically, the canvas provides the hardware by which various technologies will sprout. That\u2019s not to say you can blindly jump aboard the sector. However, this arena offers a greater probability of success than arguably most other competing sectors.\n\nThe numbers are mouthwatering. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global semiconductor market reached a valuation of $611.35 billion last year. Experts project that by 2032, the sector could be worth over $2.06 trillion. If so, that would imply a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.9%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou\u2019re not going to find too many markets that offer that kind of growth. With that, below are enticing semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce one of the juggernauts among semiconductor stocks to buy, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is almost treated nowadays as an afterthought. Unfortunately, the enterprise struggled with both internal and external shortfalls. Admittedly, it has fallen behind in certain key areas. Nevertheless, it commands a powerful brand reputation. It could also be poised for a comeback.\n\nSure, analysts overall are rather pensive on INTC stock, rating it a consensus hold. However, the average price target of $40.31 implies a nearly 32% upside potential. Plus, the most optimistic target calls for a per-share price of $100. Financially, during the trailing 12 months (TTM), Intel posted net income of $4.07 billion or 97 cents per share. Revenue during this period landed at $55.24 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts see earnings per share rising 3.8% to $1.09. On the top line, sales may see a 2.9% bump to $55.8 billion. That\u2019s rather modest. However, in fiscal 2025, EPS could fly to $1.95 on revenue of $62.64 billion. Combined with a forward dividend yield of 1.63%, INTC deserves some consideration for semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nA top-tier name among specialist chip manufacturers, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) focuses on wireless connectivity solutions. As well, it\u2019s also a relatively silent or underappreciated player in the digital intelligence game. Yes, Nvidia dominates the AI segment overall. However, such protocols are consuming energy at an alarming rate. Qualcomm is busy developing high-efficiency chips that may help address this consumption risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a holistic business opportunity, Qualcomm hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy. At the same time, QCOM stock gained nearly 62% since the start of the year. That means the average price target among experts sits at $198, implying almost 13% downside risk. However, the most recent targets call for positive growth. Further, the most optimistic view stands at $245.\n\nFinancially, Qualcomm posted net income of $8.45 billion, translating to EPS of $7.49. Revenue in the cycle hit $36.41 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate robust expansion of nearly 18% to $9.93 EPS. On the top line, sales may rise 7.2% to hit $38.42 billion. The company also provides a forward yield of 1.5%, making it one of the attractive semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Santa Clara, California, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) falls under the semiconductor equipment and materials sector. Per its public profile, Applied engages in the provision of manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. It\u2019s one of the critical \u201cstagehand\u201d enterprises that keep the tech ecosystem flowing.\n\nIt also hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by Wall Street analysts, who rate AMAT stock a consensus moderate buy. However, the market also has its eyes on Applied, sending shares up almost 61% since the beginning of January. As a result, the average price target of $239.91 implies more than 3% downside risk. However, on the positive side, the most optimistic view calls for $280 per share.\n\nFinancially, during the TTM period, the company posted net income of $7.3 billion or $8.70 per share. Revenue in the cycle reached $26.5 billion. For fiscal 2024, EPS may rise modestly by 4.2% to $8.39 on sales of $26.94 billion. However, the big boom can happen in fiscal 2025, when EPS potentially runs to $9.69 on revenue of $30.02 billion.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the most important semiconductor stocks to buy, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) falls under the computer chip equipment and materials segment. Per the corporate profile, ASML produces, sells and services advanced semiconductor solutions. Among these specialties is deep ultraviolet lithography, which allows enterprises to print complex patterns on silicon wafers. Given the essential nature of the aforementioned business, ASML deserves a close look.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy. While the average price target of $1,102.25 doesn\u2019t imply much growth, it\u2019s always possible for experts to modify their ratings based on present market dynamics. Financially, during the TTM period, ASML posted net income of $7.11 billion or $19.32 per share. Revenue reached $26.1 billion in the cycle.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts see a slight dip in EPS to $20.51. Further, revenue growth may be modest, up only 1.4% to $29.81 billion. However, fiscal 2025 could be a completely different story. By then, EPS could soar to $32.10. Also, revenue may jump 32.4% to hit $39.46 billion. Further, the blue-sky target calls for $42.81 billion.\n\nGlobalFoundries (GFS) In this photo illustration GlobalFoundries (GFS) Inc. logo is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Malta, New York, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) belongs on your list of semiconductor stocks to buy for the long haul. According to its public profile, GlobalFoundries provides a range of mainstream wafer fabrication and technologies. It builds various semiconductor devices, including microprocessors, mobile application solutions and network-related chips.\n\nOne of the core consequences of the Covid-19 crisis was of course the semiconductor supply chain disruption. Further, a realization occurred in that enterprises and agencies saw the vulnerability of having fabrication services conducted mainly in one region of the world. By bringing the foundry business closer to home \u2013 or at least diversifying the process \u2013 the entire value chain could benefit.\n\nTo be fair, analysts are not really looking for much this fiscal year. Indeed, EPS is projected to fall more than 40% to $1.34. On the top line, sales may erode 9.1% from last year\u2019s print of $7.39 billion to $6.72 billion. However, fiscal 2025 could see a turnaround, with EPS rising to $2.05. Moreover, sales could pop to $7.66 billion.\n\nSkyWater Technology (SKYT) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHeadquartered in Bloomington, Minnesota, SkyWater Technology (NASDAQ:SKYT) operates as a pure-play technology foundry. According to the underlying corporate profile, SkyWater offers development, manufacturing and packaging services in the U.S. Again, the company benefits from the same fundamental factors as GlobalFoundries: it\u2019s bringing the business closer to home and also providing sourcing diversification.\n\nFinancially, SkyWater posted a net loss of $32.21 million or 70 cents per share in the red. During this time, however, it managed to generate $300.22 million in sales. Its current quarterly revenue growth rate stands at 20.5%. Enticingly, SKYT trades at 1.2X trailing-year sales. Just in the three months ended March 31, shares were trading hands at 1.61X revenue.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe that SkyWater will incur a loss per share of 34 cents. Admittedly, that\u2019s an unfavorable expansion from last year\u2019s 17 cents in the red. Still, revenue may rise 16.7% to hit $334.56 million. And fiscal 2025 sales could jump again to $370.5 million. It\u2019s one of the semiconductor stocks to buy, with analysts rating it a unanimous strong buy.\n\nPixelworks (PXLW) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe riskiest idea among semiconductor stocks to buy on this list (at least in my opinion), Pixelworks (NASDAQ:PXLW) presents an intriguing profile. According to its profile, Pixelworks provides video and pixel-processing semiconductors and software. It also provides digital displays, projection devices and digital signage. It\u2019s one of the top-tier players in the form of entertainment broadcasting.\n\nTo be clear, PXLW stock is priced just under a buck at time of writing. Again, the emphasis here is that it\u2019s a high-risk, high-reward idea. Part of what makes Pixelworks so enticing is that the experts love it. Among those who cover the enterprise, it features a unanimous strong buy rating. Also, the average price target lands at $2.50, which implies over 160% upside potential. The high-side target calls for $3.\n\nDuring the TTM period, the company posted a net loss of $21.85 million or 39 cents a share in the red. However, it did generate $65.77 million in sales. Currently, its quarterly revenue growth rate stands at 61.1%. Finally, while fiscal 2024 calls for a down year, fiscal 2025 could see sales rise to $75.73 million. If so, that would imply 48.1% growth.\n\nIf you can handle the heat here, PXLW stock could be a tempting idea.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks That Follow Warren Buffett\u2019s Cardinal Rule",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is continuously seeking stocks \u2013 dividend and non-dividend \u2013 with durable competitive advantages as they ultimately end up standing the test of time. That\u2019s why their respective stocks make such good investments: Durable competitive advantages create strong pricing power. That leads to huge gains over time.\n\nHowever, maintaining competitive advantage in the fast-moving technology world is more difficult than in other sectors. The pace of innovation requires massive, sustained investments in research and development for one. Furthermore, there are always dozens of companies on the cusp of major innovation threatening to render leading tech firms obsolete, eliminating competitive advantage overnight.\n\nThe result is that maintaining an unbeatable competitive advantage in the tech world is very difficult.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBuffett is heavily invested in Apple but outside of that he\u2019s not tech heavy in general. This article looks at mostly tech dividend stocks exhibiting Buffett\u2019s cardinal rule.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to exhibit very strong competitive advantages which make its stock consistently buy worthy.\n\nCompetitive advantage is simply the ability to produce goods and services better than one\u2019s competitors. If that sounds a little bit subjective and touchy-feely it\u2019s because it is. However, we can identify competitive advantages on the income statement. It always shows up as high gross margins. Maintain those gross margins over time and your company is said to exhibit durable competitive advantage.\n\n40% is the general cut off for gross margins indicating a competitive advantage. Microsoft has consistently been in the 68 to 69% range over the past 5 years. Gross margins exceeded 70% on the most recent earnings print for the period ended March 31.\n\nIt appears that Microsoft\u2019s investment in artificial intelligence is having positive, appreciable effects on its competitive advantage.\n\nMicrosft exhibits durable competitive advantage and pays a modest dividend yielding 0.67%. Perhaps Buffett will buy it at some point in the future.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) arguably has an even better competitive advantage than Microsoft depending upon how you look at it. At the moment, Nvidia\u2019s gross margin is even higher than Microsoft\u2019s. That\u2019s all a product of pricing power which Nvidia clearly benefits from.\n\nNvidia has cornered the market for artificial intelligence chips. It enjoys tremendous pricing power as a result. In turn, gross margins surged above 72% in 2023. The question really becomes whether Nvidia can continue to sell its chips at extraordinarily high prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts anticipate that the upcoming Blackwell chip will be on par with the Hopper chip that it supersedes. However, those same analysts also believe certain Blackwell superchip iterations could fetch prices in the range of $60,000 to $70,000 each. That all suggests Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantage is only strengthening moving forward. Combine that with the recent stock split that has made shares more affordable and $150 share prices are easily within reach.\n\nNvidia has also been paying dividends for more than a decade which may surprise some.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is well known to be one of the most important companies within the semiconductor supply chain globally. The company produces the majority of the world\u2019s most advanced chips. Currently, the AI opportunity is sending its stock higher,\u00a0up nearly 70% year-to-date.\n\nThere\u2019s reason to believe that TSM\u00a0shares are going to move higher. For one, the company may charge Nvidia higher prices to manufacture Nvidia\u2019s AI chips. Recent comments from the CEO Andy Dinh have led many to speculate that the company intends to charge higher prices to Nvidia, which recently surpassed $3 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nHeadlines like that one should continue to impart the value of TSMC to the broader investment world. The company\u2019s chips enabled the development of PCs, mobile phones, and now AI. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing exhibits massive competitive advantages that show up as consistently strong gross margins that suggest durable competitive advantages. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also a dividend stock yielding 1.4%.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is another indispensable firm within the semiconductor supply chain. That continues to make its stock incredibly valuable and worth buying. The company continues to dominate the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography market.\n\nThe EUV devices that ASML produces are approximately bus-sized machines used in the manufacturing of the most advanced semiconductors. The company will produce five such machines in 2024. All five of those have been sold to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at a cost of $370 million a piece.\n\nASML offers a modest dividend that seems to be somewhat of a focus for the firm. I say that because the company changed it from an annual to a semi-annual dividend in 2019. It then changed the semi-annual payment to a quarterly dividend in 2022.\n\nASML is the only company that can produce EUV machines. Clearly, those machines are extraordinarily rare. They\u2019re also in high demand in light of the emergence of AI and the fact that it demands the highest technological capabilities in its manufacture. ASML is the sole producer of something in high demand for which extremely low quantities exist. That\u2019s an obvious recipe for extreme pricing advantages and success. That\u2019s exactly what is reflected in the company\u2019s financial reports: gross margins consistently hovering around the 50% mark.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) continued success is predicated on the competitive advantage of its products, primarily the iPhone. So, as iPhone sales go, so goes Apple\u2019s stock.\n\nUntil very recently that had been sideways at best. iPhone sales continue to fall per the most recent earnings report. The company has consistently been trying to supplant falling iPhone sales with services revenues but it has not made up the difference. The result is that overall sales continue to decline.\n\nWhy then has Apple stock turned around in the last few weeks? The unsurprising answer is AI. The markets continue to be forward-looking.\n\nSo, when Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI tools recently at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), perception shifted. Apple is no longer an AI laggard. Instead, the markets now perceive Apple to be very strong as it relates to artificial intelligence. It is also widely expected that the integration of AI into its iPhones will spike sales\u00a0as customers rush to upgrade.\n\nApple represents Buffett\u2019s largest individual holding so it\u2019s no surprise that it follows his cardinal rule. It does provide dividends and exhibits durable competitive advantages.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is deeply connected to Apple but don\u2019t let that confuse you, Apple needs Qualcomm as much as Qualcomm needs Apple. The company has long provided chips used in the iPhone. Apple has long tried to force Qualcomm to accept lower prices for those chips but Qualcomm has not budged.\n\nThe company recognizes the inherent strength it has due to its technological know-how. Qualcomm produces leading chips utilized for power management, connectivity, and computation. Beyond that, Qualcomm is also emerging as one of the better AI chip opportunities. Share prices have skyrocketed this year as a result. The markets are highly optimistic about Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon chips.\n\nAlthough Qualcomm is clearly well positioned and rife with competitive advantage, there are real risks. Share prices have risen extraordinarily quickly this year. There\u2019s an argument to be made that they are currently overpriced or fully priced. Furthermore, Qualcomm derives roughly 40% of its revenues from China. Qualcomm\u2019s competitive advantages are strong but it does face the potential for political retribution which is something to be aware of as an investor.\n\nAnyway, it is a strong tech stock in relation to its dividend and is arguably a tech stock Warren Buffett would consider.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) ko stock coca cola life\n\nSource: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is another dividend stock that Warren Buffett is famously known to hold.\n\nThat is news to very few. However, have you ever wondered what Warren Buffett likes about Coca-Cola so much? After all, it is the fourth largest position in his portfolio.\n\nThe answer is durable competitive advantage and sustainable pricing power. Coca-Cola has massive gross margins: It costs the company very little to sell its products reative to its competition.\n\nThat means the company has a lot of money left over. Its competitors have to spend massive amounts of money for research and development. Coca-Cola doesn\u2019t: The company has essentially perfected its recipe. It can sell products at high margins globally while competitors have to scramble to identify any openings. That costs them money, eroding their margins in the process.\n\nIf Coca-Cola wants to enter a new market it sets up manufacturing knowing margins will be high. The competition has no such benefit.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the dividend. It was last reduced in 1963. The durable competitive advantage I keep talking about manifests as an ultra-reliable dividend.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A senior American official is set to visit Japan and the Netherlands to ask the two countries to add fresh restrictions on China\u2019s semiconductor sector, including on its ability to make the high-end memory chips needed for artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\n\u2018I Live in Hell\u2019: Anti-Growth Fervor Grips US South After Pandemic Boom What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Nvidia Becomes World\u2019s Most Valuable Company as AI Rally Steams Ahead Nvidia\u2019s 591,078% Rally to Most Valuable Stock Came in Waves Stocks Rise as Bullish Nvidia Call Boosts AI Trade: Markets Wrap\n\nUS Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan Estevez will press his counterparts in Tokyo and The Hague to put more limits on the activities in China of Dutch supplier ASML Holding NV and Japan\u2019s Tokyo Electron Ltd., according to people familiar with the matter. Estevez\u2019s requests, part of an ongoing dialogue with allies, will highlight Chinese chip factories developing so-called high-bandwidth memory chips, said the people, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.\n\nASML and Tokyo Electron machines are used to produce dynamic random access memory dies, which are stacked together to make HBM chips. Chinese companies working on HBM chips include Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a subsidiary of China\u2019s leading memory chipmaker Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., according to China\u2019s corporate data provider Qichacha. Huawei Technologies Co. and ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc. are also reportedly developing HBM.\n\nThe Biden administration has tried for years to limit China\u2019s ability to buy and produce advanced semiconductors, arguing such steps are necessary for national security. Yet results have been mixed, with Huawei and others making significant advances. The US is seeking support from allies, who have implemented their own less stringent controls, to create a more effective global blockade.\n\n\u201cThe United States is the most critical player in the global semiconductor equipment industry, but it\u2019s far from the only country that matters. Japan and the Netherlands are also key providers of semiconductor equipment,\u201d said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe Netherlands and Japan have restrictions on exports but not on servicing, and that\u2019s a critical limitation in the overall technology controls architecture.\u201d\n\nEstevez is expected to repeat a standing US request for the two countries to tighten restrictions on ASML and Tokyo Electron\u2019s ability to maintain and repair their other advanced equipment in China as well, the people said. The US has already imposed such restrictions on American rivals, such as Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Research Corp.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US delegation\u2019s visit to the Netherlands is expected to take place after the new Dutch cabinet is sworn in the first week of July. Reinette Klever of far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders\u2019 Freedom Party is set to become the minister for foreign trade and development aid, a role that typically oversees the country\u2019s export control policies.\n\nThe Dutch and Japanese governments have been resisting the US pressure, people familiar with the matter said earlier. The two countries want more time to evaluate the impact of current export bans on high-end chip-making equipment and to see the outcome of the US presidential election in November.\n\nIt is uncertain how the new Dutch government led by Wilders will react to US demands for additional measures. Klever is co-founder of a far-right TV channel Ongehoord Nederland, which stirred controversy for its pro-Russian reporting and climate change skepticism. The outgoing Foreign Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher paid a farewell visit to the US last week to lobby for the interests of ASML. Dutch King Willem-Alexander joined Schreinemacher in a meeting with New York Governor Kathy Hochul.\n\nA representative of the US Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Dutch foreign trade ministry declined to comment. Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHBM chips are an indispensable part of the AI hardware ecosystem because they speed up access to memory, helping AI development. AI accelerators, made by Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., need to be bundled with HBM chips for them to work. US officials are having early-stage conversations about restricting the export of HBM chips, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nSK Hynix Inc. is the leading producer of HBM chips, with Samsung Electronics Co., and US-based Micron Technology Inc. pressing to catch up. SK Hynix relies on equipment from ASML and Tokyo Electron, according to Bloomberg\u2019s supply chain data.\n\nKorean equipment makers including Hanmi Semiconductor Co. and Hanwha Precision Machinery Co. also play a critical role in the HBM supply chain. Earlier this year, Washington asked Seoul to restrict the flow of equipment and technologies for making high-end logic and memory chips to China, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nChinese companies can no longer buy the most advanced AI chips from Nvidia, but Huawei is developing its own AI accelerators, called Ascend. It is unclear which company or companies are providing advanced memory chips to Huawei. SK Hynix, Samsung and Micron all stopped supplying Huawei with chips after the US tightened sanctions against the Chinese company in 2020.\n\nWashington officials have also grown worried about China\u2019s own progress in chipmaking equipment. Lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bipartisan bill to ban companies that receive US funding for chip factories from purchasing Chinese tools for those facilities.\n\n--With assistance from Jessica Sui and Yoolim Lee.\n\n(Updates with US bill on chip funding in final paragraph.

        "title": "ASML (ASML) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about ASML (ASML).\n\nASML currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.32, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.32 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy, representing 84.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ASML Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for ASML\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for ASML here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying ASML, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ASML Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for ASML, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $20.12.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ASML. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for ASML.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) The Best Hardware Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Hardware Stocks According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other hardware stocks.\n\nWith the first half of 2024 nearly over, artificial intelligence continues to play a dominant role in the stock market. Stocks that either design semiconductors that are used for AI applications, or those that use them to either streamline their internal operations such as coding or offer products to customers have also made significant gains. These show the optimism in Wall Street for accelerated computing technologies, which are collectively called artificial intelligence.\n\nIn fact, the impact of AI has been so strong that not only has it upended the status quo of the most valuable firms in terms of market capitalization, but it also allowed some of the top AI companies to post triple digit percentage share price returns over the course of the past twelve months. Some of the top performing AI stocks are up by 213% over the past twelve months and have appreciated by 773% since November 2022. Back then, the stock market was whimpering in the aftermath of rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which had hit technology stocks particularly hard since they benefit from a fast growth and low rate environment.\n\nHowever, AI's impact on the stock market has fueled the triple digit percentage gains in some stocks since then. At the same time, it has also meant that major indexes continue to demonstrate robust performance that is fueled by the share price performance of mega cap technology stocks.\n\nIn 2024, the market has moved forward from investing in AI companies that can change the world with their hardware or software to evaluating whether these firms are delivering. The first quarter of the 2024 earnings season was the clearest example of this phenomenon, and it saw Wall Street take an unforgiving approach to large and small firms that presented even the slightest hint of being unable to either grow their revenues by targeting AI or control the costs of investing in the new technologies.\n\nWithin the AI industry, there are different categories of firms. Most of these, such as OpenAI, operate on the software side. This industry subsegment develops applications such as chat bots and other assistants along with expanding the use of AI to existing software such as image editing tools. AI hardware companies power these applications, and when compared to the software firms, not only do they command stable valuations, but they also see investors take comfort in the fact that the demand for their products is far more stable and predictable when compared to software demand. Recently Goldman Sachs published a bullish report on hardware stocks due to AI, which we covered in 15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldman. In this article we are going to approach the same theme from a different angle and there are vast differences between both rankings of hardware stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top hedge fund hardware stock picks, we ranked personal computing, semiconductor, and computer hardware by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024. Out of these, the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were selected. Basically our article listed the best hardware stocks to buy according to the 900+ equity hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA technician in a clean room working on a semiconductor device, illuminated by the machines.\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 75\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the most consequential computer hardware companies in the world even though it does not sell any hardware products directly to businesses or consumers. This is because growth in hardware demand means chip manufacturers need more machines to build semiconductors, which benefits ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) since it is the only firm in the world that makes the equipment. June 2024 was a crucial month for the firm, as BofA set a new street high share price target for ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) at \u20ac1,302. The upgrade came on the back of the bank upgrading the firm's 2025 and 2026 by 6% to 9% on the back of strong performance by ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)'s advanced EUV chip making machines.\n\nFor their first quarter of 2024 investments, 75 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had bought stakes in ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML). Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management owned the biggest stake which was worth $3 billion.\n\nThe strong demand for its machines, the fact that it is the only company that makes them, and an expected surge in AI demand means that investors expect ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) to outpace the broader market when it comes to growth. This is because its forward P/E ratio of 46 is higher than the market's 21. Polen Capital mentioned the firm in its Q4 2023 investor letter where it shared:\n\nNetherlands-based ASML and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world\u2019s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.\n\nOverall ASML ranks 13th on our list of the best hardware stocks to buy. You can visit 15 Best Hardware Stocks According to Hedge Funds to see the other hardware stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ASML but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Best Stocks to Buy From the Fantastic 5",
        "content": "Wall Street loves coming up with cute little phrases, whether that be \u201cFANG\u201d or the more recent Magnificent 7. However, Thornburg portfolio manager Nicholas Anderson would like investors to be familiar with a new concept: targeting the best Fantastic 5 stocks for potentially blistering upside.\n\nFocused on European mega-capitalization plays, these five enterprises have delivered market-beating performance recently. We\u2019re talking about companies with a market value exceeding $200 billion. Yet even with this tremendous weight, these select firms have nimbly risen above the muck. Even better, many investors still aren\u2019t giving these ideas the time of day.\n\nThat could spell opportunity for the astute investor looking for the next arena in which to grow their funds. By moving in now, people can building a position before the crowd wakes up. With that in mind, below are (possibly) the best Fantastic 5 stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN) The AstraZeneca plc (AZN) logo is displayed on three waving red flags.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the world\u2019s biggest biopharmaceutical firms, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) focuses on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of prescription medicines. Fundamentally, AstraZeneca represents one of the best Fantastic 5 stocks thanks to the perpetually relevant narrative. Basically, wealth accrual means little without health. Therefore, the sector should command perpetual investment dollars. And AstraZeneca features an enviable product portfolio along with advanced acumen.\n\nEven better, the performance of AZN speaks for itself. Since the second half of April this year, shares have been flying. In turn, analysts rate AstraZeneca a unanimous strong buy with an $85.80 price target. Further, the high-side target lands at $97.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), the company posted net income of $6.33 billion, translating to earnings per share of $2.03. Revenue during the cycle reached $47.61 billion. For fiscal 2024, covering experts are looking for EPS expansion of 11% to hit $4.03. On the top line, sales may rise to $52.01 billion, implying 13.5% upside.\n\nIt has the key ingredients to rank among the best Fantastic 5 stocks.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nBased in the Netherlands, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) develops, produces, markets, sells and services advanced semiconductor equipment systems for chipmakers. Most notably, the company focuses on specialty solutions, including lithography, metrology and inspection systems. Without ASML, tech firms would have difficulty producing the intricate silicon wafers that undergird so many of our innovations. Thus, it\u2019s one of the best Fantastic 5 stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nLargely, the results speaking for themselves. Between the second quarter of last year to Q1 2024, ASML posted earnings per share of around $4.86. This print resulted in an average earnings surprise of 8.28%. While it\u2019s not the most remarkable performance out there, here\u2019s the thing: ASML beat its bottom-line targets all four times.\n\nDuring the TTM period, the tech giant posted net income of $7.11 billion, translating to EPS of $19.45. Revenue in the cycle hit $26.1 billion. For fiscal 2024, covering experts are looking for ESP of $20.64, which admittedly is a 2.7% decline from last year. Also, sales of $29.99 billion represents a modest 2% growth.\n\nHowever, EPS and revenue may jump to $32.29 and $39.69 billion, respectively, in fiscal 2025. Thus, patience may pay off.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nFalling under the biotechnology sector, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) easily ranks among the best Fantastic 5 stocks to buy. Per its public profile, the Danish enterprise operates in two segments: Diabetes and Obesity Care and Rare Diseases. Both units are critical for the broader healthcare industry. However, it must be said that the former category has seemingly attracted all the attention.\n\nNovo Nordisk has been riding the wave of success of its weight-loss drugs, particularly Wegovy. Even better, the company enjoys a burgeoning addressable market. For example, in the U.S., the rising obesity rate has become a public health crisis. What\u2019s more, this trend didn\u2019t just materialize yesterday. No, it was decades in the making and it may take decades to resolve.\n\nCynically, that may mean sustained upside for NVO stock. During the TTM period, Novo Nordisk posted net income of $89.28 billion, translating to EPS of $2.88. Revenue hit $244.24 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate EPS of $3.47 on sales of $42.3 billion. We\u2019re talking earnings growth of 30.5% and sales growth of nearly 28%.\n\nNVO is easily one of the best Fantastic 5 stocks to add to your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Technology stocks have been powering the market higher in recent years, led by powerful trends such as artificial intelligence (AI). Let's look at three of these tech stocks and discuss the reasons why they might be good options to buy and hold for the long term.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNo company has been a bigger winner from AI than chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and there is good reason to believe that the company and its shareholders will continue to benefit from current AI trends well into the future.\n\nNvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) are the main force powering AI training and inference needed to power AI applications. While not the only GPU maker, the company's chips have become the industry standard as programmers are generally trained using its CUDA software platform. This in turn has helped create a wide moat for the company, as it would be time-consuming and thus costly to have programmers learn other platforms. Image source: Getty Images\n\nWith AI still in the early innings and demand for its chips booming, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue riding the AI wave well into the future. The company is seeing huge demand from data center customers, although the technology is likely to move to other areas as well, such as automotive. Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed that his company's vehicles could be used as a distributed computing network given how much computing power will go into them.\n\nOn top of that, the company is innovating quickly, pushing out new and improved GPU architecture designs such as its recently introduced Blackwell while already announcing its next-generation GPU architecture Rubin slated for next year.\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 48, the stock looks inexpensive given its current growth and future prospects, making it a great stock to buy and hold for the long term. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nAnother company set to ride the boom in AI chips is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC for short. The company is a leading semiconductor contract manufacturer and produces chips for Nvidia and other semiconductor companies in its foundries.\n\nWith demand for AI chips outpacing supply, TSMC is in the process of expanding capacity. The company is expanding and building out new fabrication facilities (fabs), while also pushing new technological innovations, such as moving to 2-nanometer production technology. As chip density is improved, more chips can fit on a wafer, increasing capacity while also improving the performance and power consumption of the chips as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven Nvidia's success, more and more companies have been developing their own AI chips to try to get a piece of this huge market, from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices to cloud computing companies such as Amazon and Alphabet. This puts TSMC in a strong spot as chipmakers try to secure limited capacity, giving the company nice pricing power. In fact, the company has indicated it will be raising prices soon.\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27, the stock is attractively valued given the long runway of growth in front of it, and a solid stock to buy and hold for the long term. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nTSM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\n3. ASML\n\nContinuing the theme of tech stocks set to benefit from the AI chip boom leads to ASML(NASDAQ: ASML), which makes the equipment that companies like TSMC use to make semiconductors. With the need for more AI chips and fab expansion also comes the need for more equipment used to make those chips.\n\nASML is set to benefit from the increasing demand for its semiconductor equipment, as well as from the introduction of its latest technology, the high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet lithography system, or high NA EUV. The new system will allow manufacturers to make transistors smaller and be able to put more of them onto silicon wafers. ASML says its new high NA EUV technology will improve manufacturing productivity as well as lower production costs while improving chip functionality.\n\nThe company is set to ship its latest systems to its three largest customers by year-end. At a price tag of $380 million, the systems are not cheap and will be a nice revenue driver for ASML as chip manufacturers look for the newest technology to produce the most chips to help meet the insatiable demand for AI chips. ASML PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nASML trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of about 49 times, but with the new system, revenue, and earnings growth is expected to surge next year, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) expected to climb from an estimated $20.48 this year to $31.79 in 2025. That would lower its valuation to an attractive forward P/E of 32 times. Given the AI chip boom, that's an attractive valuation and makes ASML another strong stock to buy and hold over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Catapult Your $100K Into a Cool Million: June 2024",
        "content": "These so-called \u201cmillionaire-maker\u201d stocks have the potential to turn a $100,000 investment into $1 million over the next decade. As legendary Fidelity fund manager Peter Lynch explained, a \u201ctenbagger\u201d stock appreciates 10 times its original purchase price, generating a 1,000% return for early investors.\n\nLynch made a fortune for mutual fund investors by spotting tenbaggers early. Today\u2019s forward-thinking stock pickers aim to identify the next stocks poised for +1,000% upside over the next 10 years.\n\nThe key is finding reasonably valued stocks tapping into massive market opportunities. According to value investor Mohnish Pabrai, the \u201cmagic\u201d compound growth rate is 26% annually. At that rate, money doubles every 3 years. So a stock growing earnings at 26% for a decade can easily become a tenbagger.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe 3 stocks in this article exhibit strong growth drivers that could potentially catapult a $100K investment to over $1 million by 2034. With vision and rigorous analysis, ordinary investors may uncover millionaire-maker stocks in everyday observations. The next tenbagger could be under the radar right now.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a reputation that engenders great expectations, and this is a confidence that is not misplaced. This tech titan just keeps growing \u2014 both its top and bottom lines. Thanks to the incredible loyalty of its customers and its ecosystem of products and services, Apple\u2019s earnings per share shot up 280% over the past decade.\n\nAnd this growth seems far from over. For example, Apple continues to expand into new areas like financial services, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, streaming entertainment and more. These initiatives have already started bearing fruit \u2014 Apple hit over $23 billion in fiscal Q2 2024 from services alone. As a result, service-generated revenues accounted for slightly over 20% of the $90.8 billion total revenue.\n\nShareholders are also benefiting from Apple\u2019s massive buyback program. The company just approved another $110 billion of share repurchases, an impressive increase over the previous $90 billion. By reducing the total share count, buybacks boost earnings per share. So as Apple keeps raking in profits, a shrinking share base will help EPS climb even more steeply. With leadership in multiple massive markets, immense brand value, and a fast-growing services business, Apple is clearly among the top millionaire-maker stocks.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) has already seen a significant surge, but it still has plenty of room to grow. As a result, it easily makes the list of the top millionaire-maker stocks, allowing investors to at least get close to 10Xing their investment.\n\nASML is the world\u2019s leading supplier of chip-making equipment, holding over 90% market share in lithography systems for advanced nodes below 10nm. Its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools are critical for cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing, enabling smaller and more powerful chips.\n\nIn Q1 2024, ASML generated \u20ac5.3 billion in total net sales and \u20ac1.2 billion in net income. For the full year 2023, sales grew 30% to \u20ac27.6 billion with 51.3% gross margins. ASML also returned \u20ac3.3 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, with an additional \u20ac12 billion slated for additional repurchases by the close of 2025. Importantly, ASML ended 2023 with a massive \u20ac39 billion order backlog.\n\nWhile 2024 will be a transition year amidst the semiconductor downcycle, secular growth drivers and expanding applications for chips bode well for multi-year growth. ASML expects the industry to double over the next decade. To capitalize, ASML is investing to expand capacity and prepare for the strong ramp expected in 2025-2026.\n\nWith advanced lithography technology driving the bleeding edge of Moore\u2019s Law, no company is better positioned than ASML to be among the top millionaire-maker stocks.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nDespite recent mishaps, such as AI overviews in Google search bombing, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) is still among the top millionaire-maker stocks. The tech giant delivered strong first-quarter 2024 results, with revenues of $80.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Operating margins also expanded, highlighting Alphabet\u2019s ability to reengineer costs amid growth.\n\nDriving gains is Alphabet\u2019s leadership in AI research and infrastructure. As the company enters the \u201cGemini era\u201d over the next decade, its global product footprint positions it to benefit tremendously from the next wave of AI innovation. Already, Alphabet is integrating its Gemini AI models into advertising and enterprise products, creating new revenue streams.\n\nEqually promising, Alphabet recently announced a $0.20 per share quarterly dividend, its first ever. The Board also authorized a sizable $70 billion increase to the company\u2019s share repurchase program. These shareholder-friendly moves confirm Alphabet\u2019s consistent cash generation and intent to return capital when possible.\n\nLastly, Alphabet onboarded a top-tier CFO in Anat Ashkenazi, poached from pharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). With Eli Lilly shares up over 50% annually over the past three years amid blockbuster obesity drugs, Ashkenazi joins Alphabet at an ideal time to optimize investments into groundbreaking growth engines like generative AI. With strong growth and profits already in motion, shareholder returns improving, and top talent leading the financially disciplined charge into the AI era, Alphabet checks all the boxes as one of the attractive millionaire-maker stocks over the next decade.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrea van Schalkwyk held long positions in AAPL and GOOGL.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks That Are Worthy Challengers to Nvidia",
        "content": "Today, we will explore three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks challenging Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), each poised with distinct strengths and growth potential for investors. With its cutting-edge GPUs and AI hardware, Nvidia has become the dominant force in the AI space. As a result, NVDA shares are up over 150% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAccording to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 65% of organizations have embraced generative AI, nearly doubling adoption rates in the past ten months. As the AI ecosystem evolves, numerous companies are emerging as strong competitors. With the global AI market projected to surge at a compound\u00a0annual growth\u00a0rate (CAGR) of over 35% from 2024 to 2030, opportunities are boundless. If you are looking for AI stocks challenging Nvidia, these three picks could be your ticket to generous returns in 2024 and beyond.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe first pick among AI stocks challenging Nvidia is ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the world\u2019s largest producer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Dutch company dominates the market in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, essential for advanced semiconductor nodes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, in the first quarter of 2024, ASML\u2019s revenue dropped 22% year-over-year (YOY) to 5.3 billion euros, with net bookings at 3.6 billion euros compared to 3.8 billion euros in the previous year. Earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter also declined by 37% YOY to 3.11 euros, reflecting the impact of weaker-than-expected sales on profitability.\n\nManagement sees 2024 as a transition year, investing in capacity and technology for an anticipated market recovery. Key customers are likely to upgrade their systems in 2025. Analysts highlight ASML\u2019s significant AI exposure in Europe, predicting a major increase in AI-related bookings next year.\n\nFitch Ratings has upgraded ASML\u2019s long-term issuer default rating to A+ from A. The report cited ASML\u2019s market dominance, technological leadership in EUV tools and strong cash flow despite industry risks.\n\nSince January, ASML stock has returned over 40%. Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46.3x and a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 14.6x. Wall Street maintains a favorable outlook, with a 12-month median price forecast of $1,076 for ASML, implying a 2% upside potential. Interested readers may regard a decline toward the $1,000 level as a potential entry point.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong today\u2019s AI stocks challenging Nvidia is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). It emerges as a leading player in high-speed networking, providing cutting-edge solutions for modern digital infrastructure. Broadcom maintains a stronghold in custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) as one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 12,\u00a0Broadcom reported consolidated net revenue of $12.5 billion for the second quarter, a 43% increase year over year. Excluding the contribution from the VMware acquisition, revenue was up 12%. Management noted that Broadcom was making strong progress in integrating VMware and accelerating its growth.\n\nBroadcom has demonstrated significant organic growth, leveraging robust AI momentum through its diverse product range. As a result, revenues from AI was very strong at over $11 billion. The company stands to benefit from increased capital expenditure by major cloud giants. Meanwhile, management raised its fiscal 2024 revenue guidance to $51 billion. Finally, Broadcom announced a 10-for-1 stock split. This move could make the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors, potentially increasing demand.\n\nInvestors are pleased that Broadcom has expanded its partnership with Google Cloud. According to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Broadcom recently won a lucrative contract with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) for its next-gen ASIC chips.\n\nSo far this year, AVGO stock has gained nearly 35% and offers a 1.3% dividend yield. Shares are trading at 30.7 times forward earnings and 16.2 times sales. In contrast, Nvidia boasts a forward P/E ratio of 47.1x and a P/S ratio of 38x, making AVGO a comparatively cheaper option.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe conclude our discussion on AI stocks challenging Nvidia with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Positioned at the forefront of the AI revolution, Microsoft\u2019s significant R&D spending, strategic acquisitions and partnerships have driven substantial growth across its business segments.\n\nIn late April, the tech giant reported solid third quarter 2024 results. Revenue rose 17% year over year to $61.9 billion, fueled primarily by a 23% increase in cloud revenue. Net income surged 20% year over year to $21.9 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s Azure cloud platform has been a key driver of growth, with revenue growing by 31% YOY. Microsoft is leveraging this growth to introduce AI-as-a-service features on Azure, capitalizing on the demand for AI solutions. Wall Street highlights that Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0partnership with OpenAI underscores its growth potential by integrating OpenAI\u2019s technology into its products.\n\nYTD, MSFT stock is up more than 16%. Meanwhile, shares change hands at 32 times forward earnings and 13.5 times trailing sales. Finally, analysts have a 12-month price target of $480 for MSFT, implying a potential upside of 9%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Ready to Split",
        "content": "Stock splits are back in the spotlight after Nvidia took this step recently. Investors should remember that this is simply a cosmetic move that doesn't change the value and fundamentals of a company. What a stock split does is increase the number of outstanding shares while reducing the price of each share. So, the overall market value of the company remains the same.\n\nHowever, there is a belief that a stock split might increase demand for a company's shares because more investors would be able to buy them, with each share now available at a lower price.\n\nThat's probably one reason why the likes of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) could consider splitting their shares. Let's check why these two companies, which are playing a crucial role in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, look ripe for a stock split.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nThe stock of Super Micro Computer (also known as Supermicro) has tripled in value over the past year and is now worth just over $760 a share. However, it's still down 34% from the 52-week high that it hit in March, which is why management might consider splitting the stock to attract investor interest.\n\nSupermicro has never executed a stock split. Management probably didn't feel the need to do so because shares were trading at around $80 at the end of 2022. However, the booming demand for its AI server solutions has led to an 858% increase in its share price since the beginning of 2023. That means Supermicro has jumped by a multiple of more than 9 in less than 18 months.\n\nThat's why the time looks ripe for a stock split at Supermicro. However, because a split is nothing more than a cosmetic move, now would be a good time to buy its shares regardless of a split to take advantage of the recent pullback in the stock's price.\n\nAfter all, the demand for Supermicro's AI servers is so strong that its revenue tripled in the third quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31) to $3.85 billion, and adjusted net income quadrupled year over year to $6.65 per share.\n\nManagement has guided for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $5.3 billion and expects adjusted earnings to land at $8.02 per share at the midpoint of its guidance range. The company reported $2.18 billion in revenue in the same quarter last year along with adjusted earnings of $3.51 per share. If it meets its forecast, the top and bottom lines are set to more than double once again in the current quarter.\n\nAnd Supermicro can sustain its healthy growth in the long run since the AI server market that it supplies is forecast to grow 26% annually for the next five years. AI server sales are predicted to increase from just over $12 billion in 2023 to more than $50 billion in 2029.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are some more-ambitious estimates as well, with contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn expecting AI server sales to hit $150 billion in 2027.\n\nSupermicro's recent results indicate that it is growing faster than the AI server market, a sign that it is gaining ground in this space. In all, the company's lucrative AI-related opportunity and its rapid growth are solid reasons to buy the stock now. What's more, Supermicro is trading at just 21 times forward earnings, a discount to the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 28 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).\n\nSo, investors have a nice opportunity to buy this AI stock, and they should consider taking advantage, considering its healthy prospects are not going to be affected by a stock split.\n\n2. ASML Holding\n\nASML Holding is another company that could consider splitting its stock, with each share now trading at just over $1,040. The last time the Dutch supplier of semiconductor-manufacturing equipment executed a split was in October 2007, and its shares have surged 2,250% since then.\n\nThese impressive gains are a result of the central role that it plays in the semiconductor industry, and not because of its split almost 17 years ago.\n\nASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines allow foundries to make chips for a variety of applications. And AI is a catalyst that has customers lining up to buy its EUV machines to manufacture advanced chips using process nodes of 7 nanometers (nm), 5nm, 3nm, or smaller. The smaller the process node, the more powerful and efficient the chip is.\n\nAs the need for AI chips grows, ASML is witnessing robust demand for its EUV machines, and the company was sitting on an order backlog worth 38 billion euros ($40.9 billion) at the end of the first quarter of 2024. That's higher than the company's 2024 annual revenue forecast of $29.6 billion, which is in line with its revenue in 2023.\n\nManagement forecasts an acceleration in revenue growth in the second half of 2024 thanks to the recovery in the semiconductor market. Moreover, the company is set to start delivering its new machine, priced at $380 million, to semiconductor suppliers this year to help them manufacture advanced AI chips.\n\nThe market for those chips is forecast to clock annual growth of 38% through 2032, so ASML should continue to witness healthy demand for its EUV machines. And because it is the only manufacturer of these machines, it's no surprise to see its earnings growth being predicted to accelerate significantly next year. ASML EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSo even if the company doesn't split its stock to lower the value of each share, its prospects suggest that it is built for more upside in the long run. Investors looking for a semiconductor stock with a mission-critical role in the AI revolution can consider buying ASML Holding before its growth accelerates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "ASML (ASML) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned +13.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, to which ASML belongs, has gained 10.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nASML is expected to post earnings of $3.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -6.6%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.19 indicates a change of +55% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ASML is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ASML _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of ASML, the consensus sales estimate of $6.35 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -15.6%. The $29.43 billion and $40.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.3% and +36.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nASML reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.6%. EPS of $3.38 for the same period compares with $5.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.32%. The EPS surprise was +19.01%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nASML is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ASML. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "These Could Be the Next Monster AI Stock Splits After Nvidia",
        "content": "If you've been wanting to buy Nvidia at a cheaper price, you now have the opportunity. The tech giant conducted a 10-for-1 stock split after the market close on June 7, 2024. Nvidia's share price is the lowest it's been in years.\n\nWhich AI leaders could have monster stock splits on the way after Nvidia? Here are two top candidates and one definite pick.\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nIn one sense, Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) has never split its stock. Avago acquired the \"old\" Broadcom in 2016 and retained its name. The \"old\" Broadcom had conducted three stock splits before being acquired. However, Avago had never split its shares -- and neither has the \"new\" Broadcom.\n\nBroadcom's share price currently hovers around $1,440. That's well above Nvidia's share price when it split its stock. Although the company's management team hasn't hinted at a stock split so far, the timing could be right for one -- perhaps a 10-for-1 split along the lines of what Nvidia did.\n\nBroadcom's networking products are enjoying strong demand in AI data centers. The company isn't resting on its laurels, though. It recently announced a new portfolio of ethernet adapters specifically designed for AI infrastructure. Broadcom believes its latest product launch \"revolutionizes the AI networking landscape.\"\n\n2. ASML Holding\n\nASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) has conducted five stock splits in its history. This number includes two reverse stock splits, one in September 2007 and another in November 2012.\n\nThere's a good case that another conventional stock split is due. ASML's share price tops $1,040 and has remained above $800 throughout most of 2024 so far. However, the company has given no indications that a stock split is in the works.\n\nASML stands as the only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines used to make the most advanced chips. How important is this advantage? Goldman Sachs believes that chips made using EUV \"will enable the next wave of AI.\"\n\n3. Lam Research\n\nLam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX) has had two stock splits. However, the most recent one -- a 3-for-1 split -- came way back in March 2000.\n\nUnlike Broadcom and ASML, Lam definitely has a stock split on the way. Last month, the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split scheduled for after the market close on Oct. 2, 2024. This split makes a lot of sense considering Lam's shares are trading above $1,000.\n\nLam is a leading provider of wafer fabrication equipment used in making semiconductors. The company's AI edge is in storage. AI apps require fast, high-density storage. Lam's technology enables manufacturing enterprise solid-state drives that are 50 times faster and up to five times more power efficient than hard disk drives, which currently store over 80% of enterprise data.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre these potential stock-split candidates buys?\n\nI wouldn't buy any of these stocks solely because of their scheduled (for Lam Research) and possible (for Broadcom and ASML) future stock splits. Stock splits have zero effect on companies' underlying businesses or growth prospects.\n\nThat said, I think all three of these stocks could deliver fantastic gains over the long term as AI continues to drive demand for high-powered chips and the equipment required to make these chips. Broadcom, ASML, and Lam Research should remain at the forefront of the AI chip market.\n\nTo be sure, all three of these stocks trade at premium valuations. It's possible that they could be more volatile than most stocks. However, Broadcom, ASML, and Lam should be good picks for aggressive growth investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia\u00a0Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA): Cheaper after the Stock Split, Yet Priceless",
        "content": "AI prodigy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0stock has risen colossally from $15 (split-adjusted) when I first wrote about it to almost $121 currently. It surpassed Apple to become the world\u2019s second-highest-valued company. I also predicted that NVDA could go for a stock split, and it just did. The stock continues to surprise with newer highs (+144% YTD) after its spectacular earnings beat. Nonetheless, my thesis remains intact: NVDA is attractive for the long term based on its undeniable AI leadership and exponential AI growth potential.\n\nNVDA Reports Blowout Earnings Over and Over Again\n\nOn May 22, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q1 result on May 22, driven by robust continued computing and accelerated generative AI demand momentum.\u00a0Adjusted earnings of $6.12 per share handily beat the consensus estimate of $5.60 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+461%) than the Fiscal Q1-2024 (ended April 2023) figure of $1.09 per share.\n\nImpressively, Q1 revenue jumped 262% year-over-year to $26.04 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $24.59 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 13.8 percentage points to an unbelievably new high at 78.4% from 64.6% a year ago.\n\nConcurrent with the earnings report, the company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split. While the stock split does not change the valuation or the performance of the company, it does mean that NVDA will now be more available to retail investors, creating short-term momentum in the share price.\n\nOn top of that, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis. NVDA shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis today. Markedly, this is Nvidia\u2019s sixth stock split.\n\nImportantly, NVDA\u2019s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, soared 427% year-over-year to $22.6 billion. The segment makes up 86% of the firm\u2019s total revenue. As expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that \u201cbusiness in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, the Q2 guidance appears promising, with its revenues expected to hover around $28 billion, ahead of expectations. However, adjusted gross margins are forecast to be around 75.5% versus 77% projected for Q1 three months ago. Nonetheless, it still remains far ahead of chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), with gross profit margins of 50.6% and 41.5%, respectively, in the past year.\n\nNVDA Continues to Innovate and Retains Its Top-Notch AI Leadership Status\n\nNvidia continues to innovate in the AI\u00a0space, keeping its leadership status quo intact by innovating newer, cutting-edge AI products. NVDA\u2019s latest GPUs & CPUs, backed by both its hardware and software capabilities, remain top-of-the-line in the AI industry.\u00a0As the preferred choice in high-computing data centers worldwide, NVDA commands superior pricing power.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe scope and expansion of AI continue to grow manifold, and the demand clearly continues to outpace supply. During the earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, \u201cBeyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, Sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\u201d\n\nAt the Computex conference held in Taiwan on June 2, Huang unveiled Nvidia\u2019s latest AI architecture, Rubin, which is expected to begin shipping in 2026. This follows the launch of the Blackwell platform less than three months ago in March. Blackwell, designed for high-performance AI and scientific computing, succeeded the Hopper platform, which was optimized for AI inference and training and launched less than a year ago.\n\nBlackwell is now in full production and expected to ramp up in Q3. Meanwhile, Hopper continues to see strong demand.\n\nFurther, Huang said that NVDA will launch a new family of chips every year, compared to its initial plan of releasing new models every two years. This accelerated pace of innovation and rapid transition to newer models and chip enhancements has allowed Nvidia to retain a 70% to 95% market share (according to estimates from Mizuho Securities) in the AI chip market.\n\nHowever, competition in the AI space is heating up. Competitors like AMD (with its Ryzen AI 300) and Intel are launching newer AI chips at lower prices. Despite this, Nvidia\u2019s first-mover advantage in AI technology keeps AMD and Intel several quarters behind NVDA.\n\nNVDA Valuation Still Isn\u2019t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Prowess\n\nHaving overtaken Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.\n\nOn the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive. Currently, it\u2019s trading at a forward P/E ratio of 44.7x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, NVDA\u2019s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, AMD, is trading at a forward P/E of 47.8x,\u00a0while Netherlands-based semiconductor stock\u00a0ASML (NASDAQ:ASML)\u00a0is trading at a forward P/E of 51x.\n\nInterestingly, its current valuation is still hovering around its five-year average of 46.6x despite the earnings, margins, and stock price having grown multifold. These are attractive price levels and likely present a reasonable buying opportunity, in my view, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan Nvidia.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy or Sell, According to Analysts?\n\nNVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 37 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the\u00a0average Nvidia stock target price of $123.62 suggests that the shares will return 2.2% over the next year.\n\nConclusion: Consider NVDA Stock for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nNvidia has climbed to become the second most valuable stock in the world, with a market cap of $2.98 trillion, a significant leap from just under $100 billion less than five years ago. NVDA has earned its stature by leading the AI industry to unprecedented heights.\n\nDespite increasing competition, NVDA continues to enjoy a\u00a0sizeable market share in the AI industry, which will continue to grow by leaps and bounds in the coming years.\u00a0Therefore, I will continue to buy NVDA at current levels. While some critics warn of waning demand after the initial wave of AI installations, I believe this is at least several quarters away. Therefore, I will continue to buy NVDA at current levels.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Toby Sterling\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The city council of Eindhoven, Netherlands, on Tuesday voted in favor of an initial agreement with computer chip equipment maker ASML to start planning a major expansion in the city's north.\n\nIn a 34-6 vote, the council said they would support a plan unveiled by ASML and the city government in April to develop new facilities large enough to support up to 20,000 new employees in a relatively undeveloped area in the north of Eindhoven near the city's airport.\n\nASML, Europe's largest technology company, needs additional space to grow along with the semiconductor industry, which is expected to double in the coming decade.\n\nThe company in January began threatening to shift major operations outside the Netherlands if it did not receive assurances it would be able to grow at home. That prompted the country's national and regional governments in March to pledge $2.7 billion to improve transport and housing in the Eindhoven region in a plan dubbed \"Project Beethoven.\"\n\nOpponents of the city's agreement, including representatives of the Socialist Party, said they had not been given enough time to consider the consequences of the expansion, and that residents should have a chance to vote on it in a referendum.\n\nThe Eindhoven Metropolitan Region is expected to grow from a population of 850,000 to more than 1 million in the coming decade as ASML and other tech industry firms expand.\n\nAlderman Stijn Steenbakkers, one of the architects of the city plan, said retaining ASML was of importance for the Netherlands and Europe and it would change Eindhoven.\n\n\"It's fantastic that we...have pulled ourselves out of the slump of the 1990s and have the chance to be able to choose something like this,\" he said in a debate before the vote.\n\nIn the 1990s Philips laid off tens of thousands of workers in Eindhoven before moving its headquarters to Amsterdam.\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, ASML Holding fair value estimate is \u20ac738 ASML Holding's \u20ac963 share price signals that it might be 31% overvalued The \u20ac1,003 analyst price target for ASML is 36% more than our estimate of fair value\n\nDoes the June share price for ASML Holding N.V. (AMS:ASML) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for ASML Holding\n\nThe Method\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF (\u20ac, Millions)  \u20ac5.38b \u20ac9.31b \u20ac11.9b \u20ac14.9b \u20ac17.0b \u20ac18.5b \u20ac19.7b \u20ac20.6b \u20ac21.4b \u20ac21.9b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x14 Analyst x13 Analyst x9 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.77% Est @ 6.40% Est @ 4.75% Est @ 3.59% Est @ 2.77% Present Value (\u20ac, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0%  \u20ac5.0k \u20ac8.1k \u20ac9.8k \u20ac11.4k \u20ac12.1k \u20ac12.3k \u20ac12.3k \u20ac12.0k \u20ac11.6k \u20ac11.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = \u20ac106b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (0.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = \u20ac22b\u00d7 (1 + 0.9%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 0.9%) = \u20ac362b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= \u20ac362b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= \u20ac184b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is \u20ac290b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of \u20ac963, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ASML Holding as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.329. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for ASML Holding\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Dutch market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

        "title": "3 Semiconductors to Buy as Nvidia Insiders Take Profits",
        "content": "As Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth goes hyperbolic, the semiconductor industry seems left behind. After all, much of Nvidia\u2019s excitement and value generation comes from its dominance in the graphic process unit sector of semiconductor technology. However, Nvidia is a fabless company. This means it relies on highly sophisticated manufacturers, which, in turn, rely on suppliers to produce the GPUs that drive Nvidia\u2019s market dominance. With Nvidia\u2019s growth looking unlikely to slow down, according to analysts, keeping an eye on where it spends its money could be lucrative.\n\nFurthermore, this means there\u2019s money to invest in the supply chain that puts Nvidia\u2019s products on the market. That\u2019s because Nvidia is a rising tide, raising several stocks alongside it and bolstering the value of the S&P 500. As such, here are three semiconductor stocks to buy due to their close relationship with how Nvidia dominates the market.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia\u2019s premier partner in chipmaking, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), has seen its value grow due to its relationship with Nvidia. Through its mastery of various semiconductor and microchip fabrication processes, TSM has become an asset to the tech industry beyond NVDA.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIts reputation for exceptional quality, timeliness and efficacy has kept major firms returning for repeat orders worldwide. Of even higher importance, the company has continued to improve the nanometer size of its manufacturing offerings, going from seven nanometers to two in just five years. This is exceptionally important as the smaller the manufacturing process, the more transistors it can fit on a wafer, making the resulting chip more computationally powerful.\n\nWith this push for innovation, TSM remains on the leading edge of the semiconductor manufacturing industry, which keeps its customers coming back while recruiting new ones with novel technological designs.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the critical web of suppliers to Nvidia\u2019s product, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) has continued to impress investors. Though its recent Q2 2024 earnings report saw minimal revenue growth year-over-year (YOY), the company rewarded shareholders with a boost to its earnings per share. Yet, this temporary slowdown in growth is more likely an aspect of AMAT waiting for demand to catch up to its supply.\n\nMoreover, AMAT\u2019s Applied Global Services division reported its 19th quarter of YOY revenue growth. This news came alongside another record quarterly revenue for the division, hinting at its importance to the company\u2019s business model. That\u2019s because the company\u2019s 17,000 machines earn recurring revenues through maintenance fees like Taiwan Semiconductor at all of its customers. These maintenance services also boast a 90% contract renewal rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor investors looking for the best semiconductor stocks to buy, AMAT represents a strong position as a supplier and maintainer of the industry\u2019s building blocks.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the biggest innovators in chipmaking technology, ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) specializes in the extreme engineering needed to create nanometer-level manufacturing. The company commands the market for photolithography machines by continuously pushing the edges of what is physically possible in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nSpecifically, the company\u2019s newest machine, the high-NA extreme ultraviolet system, is proving to be a strong revenue opportunity. For example, ASML recently confirmed selling and shipping a $380 million high-NA extreme ultraviolet machine to TSMC. This machine allows for transistor lines of the highest precision to be printed onto semiconductor boards, further cementing its importance to the industry\u2019s future as the push to get smaller and more powerful processors forces its necessity.\n\nFurthermore, some analysts are predicting another $6.13 billion in the remaining three quarters of 2024, which could push ASML\u2019s sales to $43 billion for the year. This would mark a 48% increase over 2023\u2019s full-year sales of $29 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Run-Up? My Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy and Hold",
        "content": "The stock market has handsomely rewarded Nvidia's dominant position in artificial intelligence (AI) chips with stunning gains of more than 222% in the past year. And the company has justified this red-hot rally with terrific growth quarter after quarter. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nSuch phenomenal growth in Nvidia's revenue and earnings comes down to the fact that it controls a whopping 98% share of the AI chip market. Market research firm Gartner estimates that the AI semiconductor market could generate $71 billion in revenue in 2024. If Nvidia manages to keep its stranglehold over this market, it could witness a huge jump in its data center revenue from the previous fiscal year's levels of $47.5 billion.\n\nSo there is a solid chance that Nvidia could continue to head higher and remain a top AI growth stock going forward. However, if you missed Nvidia's terrific run-up in the past year and are worried about the stock's valuation, there is a solid alternative to buy: ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML).\n\nLet's look at the reasons ASML is one of the best AI stocks to buy right now.\n\nASML Holding's machines have made Nvidia's AI dominance possible\n\nASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines may be the biggest reason Nvidia has dominated the AI chip market. These machines allow Nvidia's foundry partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, also known as TSMC, to manufacture chips using advanced, smaller process nodes.\n\nAccording to ASML, \"chipmakers use our NXE systems to print the highly complex foundation layers of their 7 nm, 5 nm, and 3 nm nodes.\" Nvidia's massively popular H100 AI GPU (graphics processing unit) is manufactured on a 5-nanometer (nm) process node, while the upcoming Blackwell generation of chips is reportedly going to be manufactured on a 4nm process from TSMC.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's recently announced Rubin chips, which are expected to be launched in late 2025, are expected to be manufactured using a 3nm process. Not surprisingly, chipmakers and foundries are lining up to buy ASML's advanced chipmaking equipment to fulfill robust AI-driven demand. The Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer will ship its latest EUV machine to Intel and TSMC later this year.\n\nPriced at a whopping $380 million, this machine will allow ASML's customers to manufacture chips that will be 1.7 times smaller than the previous generation of machines. These chips are expected to be deployed for AI-related workloads. The transistors are more closely packed together on chips manufactured using smaller process nodes, allowing electrons to move faster and resulting in more computing power. Also, as the electrons have to travel a smaller distance, the heat generated in these advanced chips is lower and they are more power efficient.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, chipmakers' investments to expand their production capacities will be a tailwind for ASML. For instance, a TSMC-backed chipmaker recently announced that it will invest $7.8 billion in a new chip plant in Singapore. Moreover, the growing demand for AI chips is likely to encourage chipmakers to buy more EUV lithography equipment.\n\nData Bridge Market Research estimates that the global EUV lithography market could generate $40.5 billion in revenue in 2031 as compared to $9.4 billion last year. Given that ASML has a monopolistic position in the EUV lithography market, the company seems in a position to keep growing at a healthy pace over the long run.\n\nThe company's growth is set to accelerate\n\nASML finished 2023 with revenue of 27.6 billion euros, an increase of 30% from the previous year. The company is expecting a similar level of revenue this year as the semiconductor industry's revenue fell in 2023, prompting ASML's customers to hold off on new equipment purchases this year as they work through the bottom.\n\nASML is expecting to return to growth from 2025, and its huge order backlog of 38 billion euros is going to play a key role in driving that turnaround. The following chart indicates that ASML's top line could shoot up by 30% next year. ASML Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAnalysts are expecting the company to deliver healthy bottom-line growth as well, thanks to the impressive momentum that its business is expected to gain. ASML EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nShares of ASML have gained 44% in the past year, which is lower than the 52% gains clocked by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index. However, the situation could change going forward thanks to catalysts such as AI that could drive stronger demand for the company's offerings.\n\nWith ASML trading at 14 times sales right now, which is a big discount to Nvidia's sales multiple of 38, investors can get their hands on this AI stock at a relatively attractive valuation.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nEvercore: Nvidia stock split could be a catalyst for volatility\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock will begin trading on Monday on a split-adjusted basis, and according to Evercore analysts, the 10-for-1 split could act as a potential catalyst for increased market volatility.\n\nFollowing Nvidia\u2019s earnings report on May 22, which included the announcement of the stock split effective June 10, Nvidia shares surged by 20.9% over four sessions while the S&P 500 index dropped by 0.75%. Evercore\u2019s team said this divergence in performance between the pair had \"no precedent whatsoever.\"\n\nThe investment firm pointed out that similar past events also resulted in notable momentum shifts and higher volatility. One such \u201cextreme\u201d episode happened on August 31, 2020, amid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla\u2019s stock splits, when a similarly strong Nasdaq 100-led market rally. Analysts said the momentum shifts around the split-effective dates were substantial.\n\n\u201cThe result in late 2020 was increased downside, market volatility, and a rotation of leadership from NDX/Growth to Small Cap stocks,\u201d they wrote.\n\nNow, with the potential for Nvidia\u2019s June 10 split to \u201cshift the narrative\u201d along with other catalysts such as new jobs report, CPI and FOMC data, and the Trump sentencing, Evercore advised investors to brace for higher volatility.\n\nBank of America hikes ASML stock price target to a Street high\n\nBank of America analysts on Thursday raised their price target on ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) to a new Wall Street high of \u20ac1,302, saying they are growing more confident that the European semiconductor giant can achieve \u20ac40 billion in revenue by 2025.\n\nASML, which is also a Top Pick at BofA, was described as a \"critical enabler\" of the AI infrastructure buildout.\n\nBofA increased its calendar year 2025 and 2026 revenue and EPS estimates for ASML by around 6% to 9%, reflecting \"higher confidence in higher demand for EUV tools as well as higher GM.\"\n\n\"Our new CY25/26E revenue estimates are 10-7% above css while our EPS ests are 15-9% above css,\" BofA analysts wrote.\n\n\"ASML remains our top pick in EU Semicaps,\u201d they added.\n\nBofA acknowledged concerns about foundry orders through year-end but believes that investment from leading hyperscalers and enterprise customers in AI infrastructure signals a clear need for significant capacity additions at the leading edge.\n\nStory continues\n\nArgus upgrades HPE to Buy on growing opportunity in AI space\n\nAnalysts at Argus Research upped their rating on HP (NYSE:HPQ) Enterprise stock from Hold to Buy, setting a price target of $26.\n\nThe investment firm cited the company's strong positioning and growing opportunity in the AI space as key factors for the upgrade.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), an edge-to-cloud solutions provider, exceeded consensus revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) estimates for fiscal Q1 2024 and offered positive forward guidance.\n\nArgus analysts said HPE continues to generate strong revenue from AI servers, and its overall compute business is now showing signs of recovery. Cumulative AI systems and services orders totaled $4.6 billion as of mid-year fiscal 2024.\n\n\u201cAlthough HPE continues to anticipate a low double-digit year over year decline in FY24 earnings, the company expects to grow revenue and, in our view, is positioned for sales and profit growth ahead,\u201d they wrote.\n\nDeutsche Bank lifts Adobe price target despite underwhelming GenAI monetization\n\nAlso this week, design software maker Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) received a vote of confidence among Deustche Bank analysts, who reiterated their Buy rating on the stock and hiked the price target to $650.\n\nThey note that Adobe is heading into its Q2 earnings on June 13th, with the stock currently under pressure due to competitive concerns and underwhelming near-term generative AI (genAI) monetization.\n\n\u201cWe expect some DM NNARR [Developed Markets Net New Annual Recurring Revenue] outperformance, with F2Q estimates currently subseasonal, though have less conviction around the magnitude of upside given pricing noise and lack of Generative Credit monetization,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts said.\n\n\u201cWe expect investors will key in on commentary around ex-pricing NNARR growth to get a sense of underlying momentum given y/y net pricing headwinds remain in F2Q,\u201d they added.\n\nDeutsche also pointed out early positive momentum in Express for Enterprise and the strong early growth in monthly active users (MAUs) for the recently released Express mobile app with Firefly, which supports the expansion of Adobe's top-of-funnel efforts.\n\nDespite this, the bank does not expect significant contributions from generative credit packs until more consumption-heavy generative models, such as 3-D, Video, and Animation, become widely available.\n\nBofA: Semiconductor industry set for multi-year growth as AI boom marches on\n\nBank of America is predicting a multi-year boom for the semiconductor industry, fueled by surging demand for AI. Observations from Computex, a tech trade event, pointed to a global push towards AI across various sectors, BofA analysts noted.\n\n\"We see the semiconductor industry is set for multi-year growth, with the tech titans being all in for AI at Computex,\" they said.\n\nThe bank noted AI's increasing presence in data centers, edge computing, PCs, and smartphones, necessitating larger semiconductor dies to handle the growing data and processing power. The rapid pace of innovation supports this demand, as evidenced by AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA's annual product development cycles.\n\nMoreover, BofA also highlighted ARM's projection of a substantial surge in AI-ready devices, anticipating over 100 billion ARM units capable of running AI by the end of 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: ASML receives new Street-high price target, HPE upgraded\n\nVolvo shifting EV production to Belgium to avoid China tariffs, The Times reports\n\nJefferies Report: Margin Expansion of IT Cos. in FY25 Faces Significant Hurdles\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Next Stage of AI Hype",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence is here to stay. With every new product that leverages AI to improve productivity or bring new capabilities, the skeptics\u2019 case is weakening. Many tech stocks to buy will profit from this seismic shift in technology.\n\nThe main question in the AI race remains: Which companies will reap the benefits? Obviously, semiconductor companies providing chips to support AI and accelerated computing are already profiting. Alongside the chip producers, semiconductor equipment makers like ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) and foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) are also winners.\n\nMakers of AI servers have also joined the AI boom. Indeed, Super Micro Computers (NASDAQ:SMCI) and Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) are among the best-performing tech stocks riding the demand for AI servers higher. However, when it comes to software, the environment has been murkier. There is a fear that AI could disrupt some SAAS companies and diminish their revenues.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStill, there are plenty of tech stocks to buy for the AI hype. These three stocks are bargains and present substantial upside as their AI dominance takes root.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is leading the AI revolution, with its graphic processing units enabling large language model training and inference. Despite the substantial gains over this year, it remains one of the tech stocks to buy for the AI hype. Its dominance in AI chips is almost unassailable, and the stock is a bargain based on historical multiples.\n\nOnce again, Nvidia has proven why it will continue to dominate the AI chip market with over 80% market share. Ahead of the COMPUTEX tech conference in Taipei, it unveiled its new AI chip architecture, Rubin. This comes after the announcement of the Blackwell architecture at its GTC conference in March.\n\nAt this rate of innovation, competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) can barely catch up. Nvidia has stepped up to a one-year product cycle from its historical two to three years. Given its head start, it\u2019s inconceivable that competition will catch up soon.\n\nLastly, earnings are growing faster, supporting the bullish case for the stock. Based on Bank of America estimates, NVDA stock trades at 46 times FY2025 EPS and 33 times FY2026 EPS. They maintain a $1,500 price target, presenting over 20% upside.\n\nHP (HPQ) HP sign with blue sky and autumn leaves as backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAfter reporting earnings on May 30, HP (NYSE:HPQ) soared over 10%. It is a stealth AI play that the market hasn\u2019t caught up to and presents substantial upside. AI PCs will be a growth tailwind, making it one of the best tech stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at the Q2 results, the markets were pleased by the PC and print market recovery. However, the main catalyst going forward will be AI PCs. Canalys believes a major transition from normal to AI-capable PCs has begun. They expect AI-capable PC shipments to exceed 100 million units in 2025, accounting for over 50% of all PC shipments.\n\nHP will tremendously benefit from the demand growth of its AI PC portfolio. In addition to AI-PCs, it\u2019s also launching AI-enabled devices and accessories for gaming, room solutions and advanced workstation solutions. Management has stated that these products will have higher average selling prices and lean toward the premium segment.\n\nDespite the upcoming AI products, HP is still one of the cheapest tech stocks to buy. The market isn\u2019t appreciating the potential revenue upside. At 10 times forward earnings, HPQ stock is a bargain option to participate in the AI hype.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nLately, investors have been dumping software stocks, leading to significant declines for the sector. Questions about how AI might disrupt SaaS have created uncertainty. Unfortunately, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) hasn\u2019t been spared, especially after it lowered Q2 guidance slightly. However, after a 20% selloff, CRM stock is now a cheap way to play AI.\n\nIn the application layer, Salesforce will emerge as an AI winner, making it one of the tech stocks to buy. Today, Salesforce is a top customer relationship management SaaS that serves most large enterprises. Its platform holds the largest repositories of front-office enterprise data and metadata. Moreover, everyday users on the platform are creating petabytes of data.\n\nWith AI, this treasure trove of data can become a valuable asset for enterprises. Salesforce hopes to help customers leverage AI to draw insights from their data. To this end, it has launched data cloud to power AI insights for customers. And with Einstein, it\u2019s giving enterprises predictive capabilities and enabling them to create personalized customer experiences.\n\nWith these AI tailwinds, the post-earnings selloff was overdone even though management lowered Q2 fiscal 2025 guidance. If anything, management maintained their FY2025 guidance of 8% \u2013 9% revenue growth. At 23 times FY2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $9.86 \u2013 $9.94, Salesforce is among the tech stocks to buy for an AI boost.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "After Nvidia's Stock Split, Could This Chip Stock Be Next?",
        "content": "Stock splits are back in vogue.\n\nAfter several years with hardly any stock splits on the market, big companies now seem to be eager to reverse course. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), for example, just became the fifth of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks to split its shares in less than four years, announcing a 10-for-1 stock split that's set to go into effect on June 7.\n\nNvidia shares are up roughly 20% since the announcement, benefiting from a strong earnings report, and it's joined Walmart and Chipotle as stock-split winners this year.\n\nWith all three stocks posting significant gains following the stock-split announcements, it's only natural to ask which company might be the next to follow suit, and one semiconductor equipment manufacturer seems like an obvious candidate. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWill this chip stock be the next to do a stock split?\n\nWith its share price hovering near $1,000, ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) seems like a good candidate to be the next big tech stock to split its shares.\n\nAfter all, ASML has the components that usually help trigger a stock split. It's experienced significant price appreciation in recent years, up more than 400% over the last five years and more than 1,000% over the past decade, and its individual share price is high more than $1,000. In fact, ASML's recent price of $965.48 (as of Monday's close) is above where Nvidia's was when it announced its 10-for-1 stock split, and it's climbed since. Management also seems increasingly confident that the company is about to enter a new demand cycle.\n\nASML, which makes the equipment that chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing use to produce chips, has had three stock splits in its history, but it hasn't done one since 2000. The company even had an unusual 8-for-9 reverse split in 2007, which was enacted in combination with a plan to return 960 million euros to shareholders.\n\nASML has not given any indication that it plans a stock split, but it seems as though one is likely if its stock price continues to rise.\n\nIs ASML stock a buy?\n\nASML has a history of delivering strong results for investors due to its steady growth and high profit margins. It also has one of the widest economic moats in the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe company is the leading maker of lithography systems used to make semiconductors, and it is the only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which make advanced chips that are as small as 2 nanometers. ASML says that its EUV tech prints microchips with light at a wavelength of 13.5 nm, which is nearly X-ray range.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML makes highly technical machines that are very expensive, and it only sells about 100 of them each quarter. Because of that, its results tend to be cyclical, and revenue recently declined on a year-over-year basis.\n\nHowever, management says it's in the middle of a transition year as its non-EUV business declines, and the company expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of this year and into 2025. Among the catalysts it sees in 2025 are secular growth in semiconductor end markets, including green energy, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, there's a broader cyclical upturn in the chip sector, as well as a large number of new fabs planned that are going to rely on ASML's equipment.\n\nRegardless of whether ASML announces a stock split anytime soon, the shares still look like a buy. Demand for semiconductors is only growing, and with it, the demand for the advanced chips that ASML's systems specialize in making, and that should help widen its economic moat.\n\nFor patient investors, buying ASML stock now should pay off once its next growth cycle arrives later this year and into 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

There is no clearer indication of Nvidia\u2019s dominance than the prices it charges for its chips.\n\nThe H100 AI processor cost anywhere between $25,000 to $40,000. It was introduced in 2022. Demand continues to be incredibly strong today. The company also spent $10 billion developing the H100\u2019s successor, Blackwell B200 chips. Those chips are expected to sell for between $30,000 to $40,000. They\u2019re also expected to be four times as powerful as their predecessors.\n\nThat led to another blowout earnings period for the company. The story really hasn\u2019t changed for Nvidia: Demand continues to outstrip supply and Nvidia bears continue to be proven wrong.\n\nShare prices have risen above $1,100. That\u2019s sure to incite more talk of overpricing and calls to sell Nvidia and take profits. However, Nvidia continues to prove the doubters wrong and there\u2019s no reason to believe that it won\u2019t continue to do so throughout the month of June.\n\nGoogle (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently returned to form following a very strong earnings report. Most importantly, ad revenues are again strong. Google reported nearly $62 billion in ad revenues during the period. Those ad revenues accounted for the majority of overall revenues at $80.5 billion.\n\nAI continues to be one of the most important catalysts for Google stock but ad revenues are the main driver of the company. The strong report is positive not only because ad revenues jumped from $54 billion to $62 billion. First and foremost, those ad revenues are a proxy for economic strength overall. The resurgence bodes well for the macro economy. Furthermore, those strong ad revenues provide fuel in the form of capital for AI investments at Google.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle has recently begun to invest more heavily in AI. The company is applying AI to its dominant search function in the hopes that it can further strengthen the product. Investors should be positive about Google\u2019s AI investment simply for the fact it is a hyperscaler with significant resources. Investors should consider buying the stock because ad revenues are again strong and the AI narrative is continuing to strengthen at the company.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvancved Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to play second fiddle to Nvidia in the AI chip war. A lot has been written about that and most of it concludes that it is a fine position for AMD and its stock: it is the value play in AI chips and the only realistic competitor to Nvidia\u2019s dominant position at this time.\n\nAMD is also a company that benefits from high demand on a global scale. Recent reports show the U.S. is scaling back export issuance licenses for AMD and Nvidia. While the assessment period required for license issuance will temporarily slow demand, it indicates a greater opportunity. Companies around the world are going to continue to demand AMD chips.\n\nWhile the U.S. continues to lead in research and funding, other companies are also beginning to ramp up their investments in AI.\n\nThat simple truth is another reason to consider investing in AMD this month, next month, and beyond.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are multiple positive factors suggesting Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is a great choice to buy in June for long-term growth. The simplest of which may be the fact shares currently trade for $1,264 with a consensus target price of $1,517.\n\nPundits anticipate that Broadcom may undertake a stock split to make its share price more accessible to investors. That would increase liquidity which could spike demand, raising prices in the process.\n\nThose prices will probably continue to rise anyway given that earnings surged by 34% during the first quarter. Broadcom is also expecting $10 billion in AI chip sales in 2024. The company is clearly one of the more important AI chip stocks overall.\n\nFrom the perspective of long-term growth, Broadcom makes a lot of sense as an investment. It is one of the better AI chip dividend stocks available with a yield of 1.54% at present.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) headquarters\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantirTechnologies (NYSE:PLTR) continues to impress investors in 2024 following a strong 2023.\u00a0 Last year, Palantir stock burst onto the scene following a quicker-than-anticipated progression to profitability. It then rattled off and continues to rattle off profitable quarters that suggest significant growth ahead.\n\nThe thing that continues to impress me about Palantir from the perspective of investment worthiness is its focus on Enterprise AI. The company is primarily interested in the development of AI business applications rather than those geared toward the individual consumer where there is much more there\u2019s a much bigger opportunity in that space at the moment.\n\nPalantir\u2019s core product is its Foundry platform. That platform allows firms to adapt AI into their operations. The company is also impressive from the perspective that it is rapidly growing its private side business segment. Palantir has long enjoyed a strong relationship on the government side but is quickly growing its corporate relationships.\n\nIt all suggests that Palantir stock is well positioned for long-term growth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another company that has the resources to hyperscale AI. However, the stock had been something of a laggard in relation to AI as the other tech giants struck first in 2023.\n\nThen, in 2024, Amazon upped its AI investment. That manifested in the completion of a $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic, which continues to be one of the most promising artificial intelligence companies of the future. The company is primarily using Amazon\u2019s AWS Services as its cloud provider. Anthropic will use AI chips developed by Amazon to train its algorithms.\n\nThe thrust of the agreement is very similar to that between OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Some would argue that Amazon is late to the game but in any case it now has better overall prospects in generative AI.\n\nThe company also recently received FAA approval allowing it to expand its drone deliveries for online orders.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) essentially has a monopoly position within the AI chip supply chain. The Dutch company is a gatekeeper as the leading manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography systems. The stock has benefited tremendously because of this positioning and will continue to do so throughout June and beyond. Those EV systems are crucial for the production of the most advanced AI chips.\n\nDemand for the most advanced AI chips is only going to grow from here. That simple truth is very evident in the hype and excitement surrounding the Blackwell chip release, just as one example.\n\nASML continues to struggle with significant issues, primarily export bans to China. The company recently reported that EUV systems located in Taiwan could be disabled in the event that China attacks the independent nation and major chip manufacturing hub.\n\nASML stock will continue to be an obvious choice for all of the facts mentioned above. It essentially has a monopoly position and can act as a gatekeeper exerting substantial influence across the AI chip supply chain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "ASML (ASML) shares soared 9.5% in the last trading session to close at $1,041.34. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 4.7% gain over the past four weeks.\n\nASML Holding extended its rally, driven by the fact that it has become Europe\u2019s second-biggest listed company. Moreover, its biggest client called Taiwan Semiconductor is gearing up to receive the high-NA extreme ultraviolet machine by the end of this year, which bodes well for ASML.\n\nThis equipment supplier to semiconductor makers is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.87 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -27.9%. Revenues are expected to be $6.35 billion, down 15.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWhile earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor ASML, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on ASML going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

TSMC is a key technology supplier for Nvidia\u2019s AI chips.\n\nNvidia looks to boost its investments in Taiwan, including constructing another supercomputer in Taiwan following the launch of Taipei-1 in 2023.\n\nInterestingly, Nvidia has also tapped Samsung Electronics Co for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip supply and is eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier as TSMC struggled with supply chain constraints.\n\nTSMC, which won the crown of the leading global foundry with a 62% market share, indicated 10% annual growth in the semiconductor industry, excluding memory chips.\n\nAnalysts don\u2019t see the fizzling of the AI demand anytime soon, hailing Nvidia as the key beneficiary.

        "title": "Why Applied Materials, ASML Holding, and Taiwan Semiconductor Stocks All Popped on Wednesday",
        "content": "Wednesday is shaping up to be a good day for semiconductor investors, as good news from China (and a potential money grab in Taiwan) lifts share prices of Applied Materials(NASDAQ: AMAT), ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM).\n\nAs of 10:30 a.m. ET, Applied Materials stock is up 4.9% and ASML 7.4%. TSMC bounced back from yesterday's decline with a 6.9% gain today.\n\nGood news for semiconductor equipment stocks\n\nStarting at the top of the supply chain, Applied Materials won an upgrade from Barclays this morning. As analyst Tom O'Malley explained, he's seeing a \"robust uptick\" in orders for foreign semiconductor manufacturing equipment in China, as that nation spends heavily to make itself self-sufficient in chips manufacturing. At the same time, O'Malley predicts semiconductor companies will spend \"aggressively\" on capital investment in the U.S. as they rake in subsidies from the U.S. CHIPS Act.\n\nWhat's good for Applied Materials should be just as good for its competitor ASML -- so both stocks are rising side by side this morning.\n\nBarclays also boosted TSMC stock today, raising its price target on the overweight-rated stock to $170. The analyst highlighted demand for 2 nanometer chips as a \"very, very big\" profits driver for TSMC (as well as an impetus to spend on chips manufacturing equipment). This news follows a report yesterday that TSMC may raise prices on its chip manufacturing contracts -- to try to grab a bigger share of the beaucoup profits that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been raking in on artificial intelligence chips.\n\nWhich semiconductor stock should you buy?\n\nAnd so we have three solid chip stocks to consider today. Which one would I buy?\n\nNone of the three looks cheap, with TSMC stock costing nearly 30 times earnings, Applied Materials 24 times, and ASML stock twice as much as that -- 48 times trailing earnings. Of the three, though, TSMC has the fastest growth rate at a bit more than 20%, giving it a PEG ratio of 1.5, versus PEGs of 2.4 for both Applied Materials and ASML.\n\nThis makes TSMC the closest to a \"buy.\"\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ASML shares rose on Wednesday after a Jefferies analyst report cited comments from CFO Roger Dassen which suggested he was positive about the possibility of orders coming through from top customer TSMC in the coming quarters.\n\nAn ASML spokesperson confirmed the CFO had spoken at a Jefferies-hosted call with investors.\n\nASML's shares rose 6.3% to 927.10 euros ($1,008.78) by 1314 GMT.\n\nASML, the world's biggest semiconductor equipment maker, makes lithography tools, which use beams of light to help create the minute circuitry of computer chips, while TSMC is the world's biggest maker of advanced chips.\n\nThe Jefferies report said Dassen \"sounded optimistic\" that commercial talks with TSMC were nearing conclusion, with \"significant\" 2 nm-related orders coming through, starting in Q2 or Q3.\n\nASML has previously said it targets 2025 sales in the 30-40 billion euro range, helped by booming demand for cutting-edge logic chips used in smartphones and for AI.\n\nThe Jefferies report said the company sees demand continuing to be strong into 2026, helped by government-subsidised factories being built around the world.\n\nThe report said TSMC expects to receive one of ASML's new High NA extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines, which cost more than 350 million euros each, sometime this year.\n\nIntel was the first to purchase one of the machines, with the other installed in an ASML-Imec laboratory that opened this week.\n\nASML has orders for more than a dozen of the High NA tools from all the customers who use its current EUV line, which includes: Intel, TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron.\n\nThe Jefferies report also said ASML does not believe it will face competition in EUV technology from either Chinese lithography company SMEE or Huawei \"in the foreseeable future due to the complexity of the technology itself as well as the ecosystem.\"\n\n($1 = 0.9190 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling.

        "title": "1 Top Semiconductor Stock for Massive AI Growth",
        "content": "When it comes to all things accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has rightfully stolen the spotlight. But an entire supply chain ecosystem is hard at work helping Nvidia bring its AI systems to market. And a company called Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) is one of those critical pieces of the supply chain.\n\nApplied is the largest U.S.-based supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment -- Netherlands-based ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) being the biggest manufacturing equipment provider overall, but a specialist in lithography equipment. Applied is a generalist, with a broad and deep portfolio of tech that enables crafting high-end chips of all kinds. And a new wave of growth might be just around the corner.\n\nLast quarter was just OK, so why Applied now?\n\nApplied recently reported its earnings results for its second fiscal of 2024 (the three months that ended in April 2024). Revenue was just shy of $6.7 billion, flat year over year. Earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted EPS, however, were up 11% and 5%, respectively.\n\nMuch of the semiconductor industry is either still in a cyclical slump or just emerging from the bear market of the last couple of years. Nvidia's AI and accelerated compute systems have been an obvious exception, since data centers used specifically for AI training are a brand new market.\n\nAs a result, Applied's recent revenue performance looks lackluster. It did, however, sidestep a serious downturn that many of its peers suffered since 2022 by pivoting to \"mature\" chip manufacturing geared toward things like the auto industry and its electric vehicle initiative. Along the way, management has continued repurchasing stock and controlling costs, which is what has led to EPS outperformance even as revenue has flatlined. That's truly impressive, and an indication of business model strength. AMAT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nBut in the second half of 2024, the semiconductor industry is expected to surge higher. Those new AI chips are of course leading the charge, and more manufacturing capacity will be needed to meet data center construction demand. But all the other end markets that have been down in the dumps (smartphones, PCs, and industrials like autos) are expected to join in on the party as well.\n\nTo help meet this surge, lots of chip fabs (facilities that make chips) are under construction right now, and will need to be filled with new equipment. Industry group Semi.org forecasts record sales of advanced equipment starting in 2025 and lasting through 2027. Applied is ready.\n\nPutting deep tech know-how to work\n\nApplied already has a wide and deep equipment portfolio that addresses nearly every step of the electronics manufacturing industry. And the last couple of years, it has been rolling out new equipment that deepens its hooks in this new AI race.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, in March 2023, the company officially announced a new machine called Centura Sculpta. It acts as an extension to ASML's lithography equipment used in high-end chipmaking, helping save manufacturers on cost during critical steps in the manufacturing process. Several more advanced chipmaking equipment lines were announced earlier this year addressing other parts of the chipmaking process. Applied is well entrenched in this industry.\n\nThe end result of this? The second half of the year could finally bring rekindled revenue growth for Applied, and even higher resulting EPS growth. Shares aren't as cheap as they were last year, but perhaps rightfully so, if the company delivers on the coming wave of fab spending. The stock currently trades for 25 times trailing-12-month earnings. I'm happy to continue holding my position, as well as one in ASML and some of Applied's other peers, as the next chip market growth cycle powered by AI nears.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Applied Materials right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Applied Materials, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Applied Materials wasn\u2019t one of them.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ASML is expected to post earnings of $3.87 per share, indicating a change of -27.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -6.6%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $30.65 indicates a change of +52.3% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ASML.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ASML _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor ASML, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.35 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -15.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.43 billion and $40.1 billion estimates indicate -1.3% and +36.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nASML reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.6%. EPS of $3.38 for the same period compares with $5.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.32%. The EPS surprise was +19.01%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nASML is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ASML. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Where Will ASML Holding Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have been in red-hot form on the market for more than a year now, but things haven't been all rosy of late. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector index picked up some momentum in May following a tepid performance in March and April, and that's not surprising as some major names in this sector have witnessed a pullback in their share prices, including ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML).\n\nLet's see why that has been the case and check why investors would do well to buy ASML stock right away while it is still down.\n\nASML could regain its mojo despite near-term headwinds\n\nDutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML Holding gave the market a big shock with its first-quarter 2024 results. The company -- known for selling lithography machines that allow chipmakers and foundries to manufacture chips -- delivered mixed Q1 results. Its revenue was down 24% year over year to $5.63 billion last quarter, missing the consensus estimate of $5.87 billion.\n\nThe company's earnings also fell to $3.31 per share from $5.44 per share last year. While ASML management had already warned of a steep drop in its fiscal Q1 numbers, all eyes were set on the bookings the company receives for its manufacturing equipment. That's because ASML's net bookings indicate whether chipmakers are ready to invest in more equipment to meet the end-market demand. Yet the company reported a disappointing number on this front.\n\nASML received net bookings worth 3.6 billion euros in Q1, down sharply from the 9.2 billion euros worth of bookings it received in the fourth quarter of 2023. That was well below the analyst estimate of 4.63 billion euros. Not surprisingly, ASML stock has been pulling back of late. Shares of the company are down 11% from the 52-week high they hit on March 7.\n\nIf ASML stock continues to pull back and becomes available at a cheaper valuation as compared to its current price-to-earnings ratio of 47, investors should consider buying it hand over fist. That's because the company has maintained its full-year revenue guidance and expects its business to pick up significantly in the second half of the year. Moreover, it has a huge backlog of 38 billion euros, which should allow it to meet its 2024 revenue target of 27.6 billion euros, followed by another solid year in 2025.\n\nMore importantly, ASML's machines are mission-critical to manufacturing AI chips. That's because the company has a monopoly in the EUV lithography market, and these are the only machines that can produce chips on manufacturing nodes of 7nm and below. The likes of Nvidia, Intel, and AMD are all using the 5nm node for making AI chips, and they are expected to move to even smaller process nodes to make more advanced processors.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the market for AI chips forecasted to grow at an annual rate of 36% through 2030, ASML should ideally witness more order inflow and be able to convert its backlog into revenue. That's why it would be a good idea to use the pullback in the stock to buy more shares and look beyond the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in its bookings, especially considering that its revenue growth is set to accelerate strongly from next year.\n\nThe stock could turn out to be a solid long-term play\n\nASML reported $29.4 billion in revenue in 2023. As the following chart shows, the company is expected to deliver almost negligible growth this year. However, the semiconductor bellwether's growth is set to pick up strongly from 2025. ASML Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nASML Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\nAccording to the chart above, ASML's top line could jump to $42.9 billion in 2026. The company's robust backlog and the new orders that it could receive thanks to the AI boom should allow it to hit that mark.\n\nIt is worth noting that ASML is currently trading at 12.7 times sales, which is why it would be a good idea for investors to capitalize on any pullback and buy more shares of this semiconductor company. Moreover, it won't be surprising to see the market rewarding ASML with a richer sales multiple once its growth starts accelerating, and that could allow the stock to deliver stronger gains in the future.\n\nAll this indicates that investors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolios should consider buying ASML as it could head higher over the next three years once its growth starts improving.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Most investors who buy tech stocks do so for the potential for high growth and share price appreciation. Considering that the biggest winners over the past decade have been tech stocks, this makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, some investors prefer dividend-paying stocks. In some instances, it might be worth giving up some growth potential for steady, reliable dividend income.\n\nHowever, what might not be as well-known is that many high-growth tech stocks also pay a dividend. These stocks could present the best of both worlds. Investors looking for growth and stock price appreciation can also get some dividend income along the way, improving total returns over time. With this in mind, here are three dividend-paying stocks worth buying right now.\n\nASML\n\nDutch company ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) makes the lithography machines necessary for the manufacture of semiconductors. For the most cutting-edge chips, ASML is the only company in the world that sells these machines. For a company that is integral to a vital product like semiconductors, it's not a surprise that the stock is up 1,170% over the past 10 years, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 241% total return.\n\nCurrently, ASML's dividend yield is 0.71%. That's not impressive sounding at first, but when you look back at the stock's performance over the past 10 years and include dividends, the picture changes. A $1,000 investment in ASML 10 years ago would be worth $11,590 today without dividends and $12,730 with dividends.\n\nManagement is expecting 2024 to be a slow growth year as much of the semiconductor industry is in a down cycle. But ASML has enough orders to fill that it should be able to get through the year with no issues, and it expects to return to growth in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nLong known for its Windows operating system and suite of office software, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has been in the news lately because of its move into artificial intelligence (AI). With its substantial investment in OpenAI, Microsoft has begun integrating generative AI into many of its products.\n\nThe company is also seeing increased cloud revenue for its Azure cloud computing business as other companies need extra computing power for their own AI ambitions.\n\nMuch like ASML, Microsoft has been a market-beating stock over the last 10 years, with a total return of 1,160%. Without dividends, that return would have been 972%. The dividend currently yields 0.69%.\n\nMicrosoft is expecting its cloud infrastructure business Azure to grow by 30% to 31% in the current quarter, driven by AI spending by its customers. This is in line with the recently reported third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet\n\nTechnically, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) isn't a dividend stock -- yet. Shareholders as of June 10 will receive Alphabet's first-ever dividend payout on June 17.\n\nThis new dividend program was announced alongside the company's first-quarter earnings in April. The initiation of a dividend isn't a total surprise considering Alphabet generated $16 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter and has more than $110 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet.\n\nTo start, Alphabet's dividend yield won't be much to write home about: approximately 0.5% based on the share price at the time of the first-quarter earnings release. But the company generates lots of cash so it's plausible that the payout could increase over time. This is worth considering for those who might want more dividend income in the future as they approach retirement.\n\nThe dividend announcement might have been the headline out of the first-quarter results, but the rest of the business performance was impressive. Revenue increased by 15%, the operating margin was up by 7 percentage points, and earnings per share grew by 62%.\n\nAlphabet is also making moves in the world of AI. At a recent event, the company highlighted its Gemini AI as it looks to keep pace with Microsoft's ChatGPT. Users of Alphabet's popular Google products such as Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Search can expect to see more integration of AI over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

Here are three semiconductor stocks to buy that I think deserve more attention in this AI-driven market right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nFounded over 40 years ago, Netherlands\u2013based ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) aims to revolutionize and advance semiconductor tool systems. The company is large in the metrology, inspection systems and lithography sectors. ASML stock surged 40% in the past year, surpassing the S&P 500 Index\u2019s gains. Despite a dip in post-Q1 earnings, it rose 26% year-to-date, outpacing the SPX.\n\nThe Dutch semiconductor equipment leader revealed its dividend increase plans in late April. ASML\u2019s board declared a final dividend of \u20ac1.75 per ordinary share, resulting in an annualized dividend of \u20ac6.10 and about a 0.60% yield. With a prudent 32.5% payout ratio, ASML retains room for growth and potential dividend boosts.\n\nMoreover, the company also revealed its share buyback program, targeted to repurchase its shares until late 2025.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a reasonably valued chipmaker with a 28.02 P/E ratio boasts a 1.69% yield and 22 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Over the past decade, it has maintained a 7.3% annual dividend growth rate.\n\nOn Wednesday, Qualcomm unveiled its latest innovation, the Snapdragon X Plus laptop processor, integrating AI capabilities to enhance competition in the market. With over 37% assurance in faster CPU performance and 54% less power consumption, the chip will work well on any QCOM\u2019s Snapdragon X series. That also includes the AI-powered Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nThe Snapdragon chip was recently commended for its AI enhancements for both video and photo capabilities. The advancements put the company in a great light amid growing demand for AI chips.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nWith a 54% year-to-date, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) remains a chip yet undervalued favorite. The company is also in demand for its advanced tech in 3mm and 5mm chips. As AI-capable phones, like the anticipated iPhone 16, drive sales, TSM\u2019s potential in the semiconductor market shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the 2024 North America Technology Symposium on April 24, TSMC unveiled its latest semiconductor advancements, including the A16\u2122 technology with nanosheet transistors for enhanced logic density and performance by 2026. Additionally, the company introduced System-on-Wafer (TSMC-SoW\u2122) technology to meet AI demands in hyperscaler data centers.\n\nThe company also serves as a cornerstone in the semiconductor sector, supplying many companies directly. Despite concerns about the \u201cChina threat\u201d and onshoring, its robust financials and $40 billion investment in U.S. chip manufacturing suggest resilience. With strong revenue growth, solid margins and high demand for advanced nodes, TSM remains a top pick for semiconductor exposure.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, ASML Holding achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 26% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 39% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 48.69.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for ASML Holding the TSR over the last 5 years was 444%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that ASML Holding has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 30% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 40% a year, is even better. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

        "content": "Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s latest portfolio to see some of his top AI stock picks.\n\nSince ASML Holding NV (ASML) ranks 6th in our list of the 10 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen, the stock deserves a detailed look.\n\nBillionaire\u00a0Steve Cohen is one of the few hedge fund managers who almost always dazzles with his outperformance and prescient bets. Cohen, who also owns The New York Mets, founded SAC Capital back in 1992, and since then through 2009 lost money only once. A Bloomberg report earlier this year said that Point72 Asset Management has been able to raise so much cash recently that it\u2019s starting to decline external money. The fund has reportedly raised about about $12.8 billion since 2020.\n\nPoint72\u2019s main fund returned about 11% in 2023, and 12% in the previous year.\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management runs a highly diversified portfolio. As of the end of the March quarter, the portfolio\u2019s net worth was over $41.2 billion, with tech stocks accounting for 17% of the total portfolio.\n\nUnlike long-term value investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, Cohen moves with speed and adapts quickly. He\u2019s been like this for decades. When he was in Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he would often skip classes to watch stock movements at a local brokerage. He took pride in predicting stock movements based on their direction.\n\nASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nSteve Cohen's Q1'2024 Stake: $250,626,789\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management upped its stake in ASML Holding NV\u00a0(NASDAQ:ASML)\u00a0by 14% in the March quarter, concluding the period with a $251 million stake. ASML Holding NV\u00a0(NASDAQ:ASML)\u00a0has a near monopoly in the semiconductor industry as it machines used by chip manufacturers use to make physical chips.\n\nASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) supplies ultraviolet lithography photolithography machines used to manufacture \u00a0advanced 3nm and 5nm chips. Jim Kelleher of Argus has set a $1,000 price target on the stock. Over the past one year ASML Holding NV\u00a0(NASDAQ:ASML)\u00a0shares have gained about 35%.\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNetherlands-based\u00a0ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world\u2019s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML) ranks 6th in the list of the 10 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen.\n\nClick to see the complete list of\u00a010 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and A New Dawn Is Coming to US Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

ASML is investing 80 million euros.\n\nUniversity President Robert-Jan Smits said the partnership was the largest ever for the university, and would help cement Eindhoven's importance as a \"semicon hotspot.\"\n\nThe Dutch government in March said it would spend $2.7 billion on what it dubbed \"Project Beethoven\" to improve roads, housing and the electric grid around Eindhoven to ensure that ASML did not follow through on a threat to move significant operations abroad.\n\nIn April, ASML signed a letter of intent with the city of Eindhoven for an expansion in an undeveloped area near the city's airport large enough to house 20,000 additional employees.\n\nAt the end of 2023 ASML, based in the Eindhoven suburb of Veldhoven, had 42,000 globally, with 23,000 of them in the Netherlands.\n\nThe company has a long-range forecast of 44-60 billion euros in annual sales by 2030, roughly doubling from 26.7 billion euros in 2023.\n\n($1 = 0.9241 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; editing by Diane Craft)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks continue to be a hot corner of the market. As the technology that enables artificial intelligence applications and models, demand for shares of companies that design and fabricate microchips and semiconductors is growing exponentially.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the worldwide market for chips and semiconductors is forecast to reach $2 trillion by 2032, up from $681 billion this year.\n\nGiven the explosive growth, it makes sense for investors to hold some semiconductor stocks in their portfolio. And there are more stocks to consider than just Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). While those stocks seem to get all the attention, the chip sector is diverse with plenty of names to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere is the 2030 millionaire\u2019s club: three semiconductor stocks to buy now.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs is typical, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) just delivered strong financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. The microchip-equipment maker, whose components are used by companies like Nvidia and AMD, announced earnings per share of $2.09 for its second fiscal quarter. That was ahead of analysts\u2019 consensus estimates that called for a profit of $1.99 a share.\n\nRevenue in the quarter totaled $6.65 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $6.54 billion. The company also raised its forward guidance. For the current quarter, Applied Materials said it expects $6.65 billion of revenue and $2.19 in EPS.\n\nAnalysts had penciled in for the company sales of $6.59 billion and a profit of $1.98 a share. Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson said the company is seeing increased demand for its products from chipmakers as the AI buildout accelerates.\n\nAMAT stock has increased abiyt 74% over the last 12 months and is up about 457% in the past five years.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nTo Europe with ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML). The Dutch microchip company specializes in making photolithography machines that are used to produce computer microchips. Like Applied Materials, ASML\u2019s equipment is in hot demand as the industry works overtime to produce chips to power the AI revolution.\n\nAs a result, ASML stock is up about 29% this year and up about 388% through five years. The company\u2019s stock is one of the best performers among European equities.\n\nThat said, the share price fell briefly in mid-April after the company reported financial results that missed the mark in terms of revenue figures. The downturn didn\u2019t last long and ASML stock quickly recovered. In the last month, the share price has risen 6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are finally signs of life at Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). After a long-term underperformance, TXN stock is up 22% in the past month after the legacy semiconductor company delivered better-than-expected financial results for this year\u2019s first quarter.\n\nFor Q1, Texas Instruments reported EPS of $1.20. That was ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $1.07 per share. Revenue came in at $3.66 billion, which topped analyst estimates of $3.60 billion.\n\nThe earnings beat has Texas Instruments\u2019 stock marching higher. The company primarily makes microchips and semiconductors for use in the automotive industry and industrial applications.\n\nIn terms of guidance, Texas Instruments forecast Q2 revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion and profits of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. The outlook aligned with Wall Street forecasts.

        "content": "ASML and Taiwan Semi Prep for Potential China-Taiwan Conflict with Remote Shutdown Feature\n\nASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) can remotely turn off their sophisticated chipmaking machines if China invades Taiwan, Bloomberg reports.\n\nU.S. government officials have discussed with Dutch and Taiwanese authorities the potential consequences if China\u2019s aggression towards Taiwan escalates into an attack. These discussions have raised\u00a0concerns\u00a0given Taiwan\u2019s critical role in global semiconductor production,\n\nAlso Read: Pay More for Chips Made Outside Taiwan as AI Demand Soars and Global Expansion Continues: Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nDuring a meeting with the Dutch government, ASML confirmed its ability to deactivate these machines remotely despite the threat. The Netherlands has conducted invasion simulations to better evaluate the risks.\n\nThis remote shutdown capability is specific to ASML\u2019s line of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines. It is crucial for producing the smallest and most advanced microchip transistors, with TSMC being the primary client.\n\nThese EUVs, essential for AI and sensitive military technologies, are the only ones of their kind and are produced exclusively by ASML in Veldhoven.\n\nASML\u2019s EUV machines, each costing over 200 million euros, are tightly regulated. Influenced by U.S. pressures, the Dutch government restricts ASML from selling these machines to China due to the potential advantages it could give in the global semiconductor competition.\n\nU.S. influence has also led to the Dutch government\u2019s recent actions to stop exports of ASML\u2019s highly sophisticated chipmaking machines to China.\n\nBefore this, U.S. officials had already influenced ASML to cancel certain deliveries to Chinese firms.\n\nASML anticipates that the latest export-control measures will impact up to 15% of its sales to China this year.\n\nPrior reports indicated Huawei Technologies Co\u2019s self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) patent bypassed the need for ASML\u2019s EUV machines, which\u00a0are\u00a0restricted\u00a0by\u00a0U.S.\u00a0embargo.\n\nIn November, Huawei outbid\u00a0Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) for a significant artificial intelligence chip order from Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) as U.S. sanctions took effect.\n\nSimultaneously,\u00a0Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and other Chinese companies reportedly planned substantial cuts in their Nvidia chip orders. Chinese cloud companies expect to reduce their orders for high-end AI chips from Nvidia.\n\nDespite a 5.5% decrease in overall imports in 2023, China\u2019s imports of chipmaking machines surged by 14% to nearly $40 billion, the highest since 2015. This spike included a notable increase in imports from the Netherlands, driven by anticipation of stricter export controls.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: ASML shares traded lower by 1.21% at $928.04 premarket\u00a0at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced\u00a0with the help of\u00a0AI tools and\u00a0was\u00a0reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via ASML\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR (TSM): Free Stock Analysis Report ASML HOLDING (ASML): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article ASML and Taiwan Semi Prep for Potential China-Taiwan Conflict with Remote Shutdown Feature originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Ready to Split",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence revolution has caused a growth surge for the technology's enablers, most of which reside in the semiconductor sector.\n\nIn fact, the stock movements for these companies have been so strong that many now trade at very, very high stock prices, setting these AI beneficiaries up for a potential stock split.\n\nStock splits don't create or destroy any value on their own. After all, if a company has twice as many shares but half the stock price, the company's total market cap remains the same. However, stock splits can help certain people afford shares if they don't have a broker that allows fractional share buying. Moreover, splits can increase a stock's liquidity, which can help lower-bid-ask spreads for trading purposes, and therefore attract larger funds to a stock.\n\nTherefore, even though the following five stocks have already had very strong runs, a split could potentially drive these AI winners to even further upside.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nFirst and most obvious on the list is AI GPU leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Not only is Nvidia currently leading the entire AI revolution with its best-in-class AI chips and software ecosystem, but it also has a history of stock splits. While Nvidia split its stock a few times in the early 2000s, its most recent was a 4-for-1 split in July 2021.\n\nOf course, with the stock having quintupled since that split a mere three years ago and its share price reaching $944 as of this writing, it's not a stretch to the think the company may choose to split its stock again.\n\nNvidia anticipated the AI revolution well before other peers did, giving it a long multi-year lead. In fact, Nvidia has been investing in its CUDA software ecosystem since 2006. CUDA allows developers to program Nvidia's graphics processors for data processing, thus enabling AI. Fast forward to the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, and that foresight looks like a stroke of genius. The 17-year head-start on the competition has allowed for some nice network effects, with AI developers building most of their applications with CUDA and making it difficult for competitors to make inroads.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels; last October, management declared it would double the speed at which it introduces a new chip architecture, from once every two years to once per year. On that note, management introduced its new Blackwell architecture in March, which will be hitting the market in late 2024. These new AI chips offer a big leap forward over even the current Hopper architecture, offering 2.5 times the training performance and up to five times the inference performance over its predecessor.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has its Q1 earnings release tomorrow on Wednesday, May 22, and all indicators point to its strong AI-fueled hypergrowth continuing. Will Nvidia split its stock again? Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nOne AI stock that has had even better returns than Nvidia over the past three years is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Sure, a lot of Super Micro's recent success is owed to Nvidia's AI chips, but SMCI's returns in the stock market have actually been far superior. Since July 2021, the last time Nvidia split its stock, Nvidia is up by five times. But Super Micro's stock has increased a whopping 25 times over in less than three years. As a result, Super Micro's stock price has appreciated to about $900 per share as of this writing, setting it up for a potential split.\n\nA good part of that outperformance was a result of Super Micro's starting from a significantly lower valuation. In the past, its server products were thought of as \"commoditized\" with a lot of other competitors in the space.\n\nBut the AI revolution has exposed the business model strengths CEO Charles Liang had been cultivating for 30 years. Architecting its servers out of, \"building blocks,\" or creating the smallest possible modules or server components independently, then being able to build servers out of any combination of these components, Super Micro has mass-customization capabilities that enable it to satisfy virtually any customer modification request. Not only that, but the architecture also saves on costs, as parts of a server can be refreshed instead of having to replace an entire system.\n\nMoreover, Liang has stressed energy-efficiency in its server design for some 20 years, far before it was fashionable. But with the enormous electricity needs and costs of AI servers, Super Micro's efficient designs are finding even more favor today. And with offices right in the heart of Silicon Valley close to Nvidia and other chipmakers, Super Micro is often able to stay ahead of competitors with the latest in-demand features such as liquid cooling, and is often first-to-market with servers containing the latest and greatest chips.\n\nWhile Super Micro's P/E ratio has ballooned from the single digits to 50 over just the past few years, it's also displaying the growth to back it up, with a stunning 200% growth last quarter. As such, I'd expect Super Micro's share price to at least maintain these valuation levels, with a stock split potentially in the cards. Super Micro stock has seen the biggest gains from the AI revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nAnother AI beneficiary is Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), thanks to two main factors. First, Broadcom makes the world's leading networking and routing chips with its Tomahawk and Jericho brands, and data center networking needs are exploding thanks to the data-intensive nature of AI.\n\nSecond, Broadcom has application-specific integrated chip (ASIC) design IP that third parties can use to make AI accelerators. In this area, Broadcom has landed some big fish, with both Alphabet and Meta Platforms using the company's ASICs to design their own in-house AI accelerators.\n\nAs a result of its highly cash-generative business and AI-fueled growth, Broadcom has seen its share price rally to over $1,400 per share. That definitely puts it in the running for a stock-split.\n\nOf course, the AI boost has only been the most recent catalyst pushing Broadcom's stock. Even before the AI revolution, Broadcom was an impressive winner thanks to CEO Hock Tan's visionary acquisition strategy. Over the past 18 years under his tenure, Tan has sought to acquire strong semiconductor franchises, then cutting costs as these defensible niche technologies are folded into the Broadcom corporate umbrella.\n\nThen in 2018, Tan expanded Broadcom's reach when it bought its first software company, California Technologies, diversifying the chipmaker into software, albeit still within its main enterprise infrastructure market. After buying cybersecurity firm Symantec in 2019, Broadcom made its biggest purchase yet in VMware, a software leader that enables hybrid cloud capabilities and data center virtualization. VMware should also benefit from the growth of AI as customers use many clouds with unique capabilities while striving to keep their data safe in their own data centers. As a result of the VMware acquisition, which closed late last year, Broadcom's software mix has grown to roughly 40% of revenues.\n\nNow, Broadcom isn't just a chipmaker, but a diversified technology platform company with many ways to win. Look for its profitable growth to remain strong in the years ahead. Both chipmakers and equipment stocks are all benefiting from the AI revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. ASML Holdings\n\nThe path to making every leading-edge semiconductor, Nvidia GPUs included, runs through ASML Holdings(NASDAQ: ASML). This is because the Netherlands-based lithography company has a monopoly on key extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology needed to make today's most advanced chips.\n\nEUV technology took some 20 years to develop with significant buy-in from ASML's customers to fund leading research, so don't think that EUV capabilities can be copied anytime soon. The resulting technology allows for chipmakers to draw extremely fine transistor designs with light wavelengths that do not occur naturally on earth. And ASML's latest version of EUV, called \"high-NA\" EUV, can print designs down to widths of just 8nm. ASML is set to rake in the dough from high-NA, just introduced late last year, as these machines currently go for between $300 million and $400 million a pop!\n\nEUV only began to be used commercially in 2018, with the first EUV-enabled products coming out in 2019. So, we are still only at the beginning of the EUV era. As such, ASML has seen its stock rocket 367% over the past five years, reaching $940 per share, thus making it a candidate for a stock split.\n\n5. Lam Research\n\nLike ASML, Lam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX) is a semiconductor equipment leader that has also seen shares rally over the semiconductor bull market. But whereas ASML is the de facto leader in lithography, which draws designs on a silicon wafer using extremely fine light, Lam's technology does the exacting and painstaking work of etching the printed design and then depositing semiconductor material in extremely intricate patterns to construct the chip.\n\nWhile Lam doesn't have a clear monopoly over etch and deposition technology like ASML does with EUV, Lam actually does have a monopoly over certain process steps in the chipmaking process. More specifically, Lam dominates the deposition technology crucial to \"stacking\" chip components in a vertical fashion. Over the past decade or so, that has led to Lam benefiting from the production of 3D NAND flash chips, in which memory-makers stack storage modules in a \"3D\" fashion in greater and greater numbers of layers with every generation.\n\nNow, logic and DRAM chips crucial for AI are also \"going vertical,\" including high-bandwidth memory DRAM that is currently seeing such strong demand from AI applications. In fact, on its January conference call with analysts, Lam management noted it had a 100% market share in certain technologies needed for stacking DRAM modules. And with new gate-all-around transistors and 3D designs making their way into logic chips, look for Lam to get a further AI boost in the years ahead.\n\nThat's why shares have rocketed 385% over the past five years to $941 per share as of this writing, setting this strong compounder up for a possible stock split as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have ways to disable the world\u2019s most sophisticated chipmaking machines in the event that China invades Taiwan, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy Iran State TV Says \u2018No Sign of Life\u2019 at Helicopter Crash Site Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is \u2018Well on the Way\u2019 One of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks Florida\u2019s 125% Surge in Property-Insurance Bills Sows Havoc\n\nOfficials from the US government have privately expressed concerns to both their Dutch and Taiwanese counterparts about what happens if Chinese aggression escalates into an attack on the island responsible for producing the vast majority of the world\u2019s advanced semiconductors, two of the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nASML reassured officials about its ability to remotely disable the machines when the Dutch government met with the company on the threat, two others said. The Netherlands has run simulations on a possible invasion in order to better assess the risks, they added.\n\nSpokespeople for ASML, TSMC and the Dutch trade ministry declined to comment. Spokespeople for the White House National Security Council, US Department of Defense and US Department of Commerce didn\u2019t respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\nThe remote shut-off applies to Netherlands-based ASML\u2019s line of extreme ultraviolet machines, known within the industry as EUVs, for which TSMC is its single biggest client. EUVs harness high-frequency light waves to print the smallest microchip transistors in existence \u2014 creating chips that have artificial-intelligence uses as well as more sensitive military applications.\n\nAbout the size of a city bus, an EUV requires regular servicing and updates. As part of that, the company can remotely force a shut-off which would act as a kill switch, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Veldhoven-based company is the world\u2019s only manufacturer of these machines, which sell for more than \u20ac200 million ($217 million) apiece.\n\nASML\u2019s technology has long been subject to government interventions aimed at preventing it from falling into the wrong hands. The Netherlands prohibits the company from selling EUV machines to China, for instance, because of US fears they could lend its rival an edge in the global chip war.\n\nIt was at the behest of the US that the Dutch began this year to halt exports of ASML\u2019s next-most sophisticated chipmaking machines. Even before that ban took effect, US officials had asked ASML to cancel some previously scheduled shipments to Chinese customers, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company expects as much as 15% of this year\u2019s sales to China will be affected by the latest export-control measures.\n\nEvidence suggests the restrictions may have come too late to stem Chinese advances. Huawei Technologies Co. last year produced a smartphone to rival Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone using chips made with older ASML printers in combination with tools from two US suppliers, Bloomberg News reported in October after conducting a break-down of the phone.\n\nBeijing has made technological self-sufficiency a national priority and Huawei\u2019s efforts to advance domestic chip design and manufacture have received government backing.\n\nChina has long claimed that the island of Taiwan is its territory, with President Xi Jinping both advocating for unification and refusing to rule out a military intervention. The superpower has been building its military and nuclear arsenal on a scale not seen since World War II and a top US admiral testified in March that it\u2019s readying to be able to invade Taiwan by 2027.\n\nThe US Congress last month approved $8 billion in aid to enhance the island\u2019s defenses. The Biden administration is also looking to boost semiconductor production on American soil, promising $39 billion in grants to chipmakers to hedge against any future supply-chain disruption.\n\nThe stakes are high, with around 90% of the world\u2019s most advanced chips made in Taiwan. On May 20, Taiwan inaugurated Lai Ching-te as president in the global chip hub, putting in power a man Beijing has branded an \u201cinstigator of war.\u201d\n\nRead More: Taiwan\u2019s New President Calls On China to End Threat of War\n\nThe EUV machine has helped turn ASML into Europe\u2019s most valuable tech stock with a market capitalization topping $370 billion \u2014 more than double that of its client Intel Corp.\n\nASML has shipped more than 200 of these machines to clients outside China since they were first developed in 2016, with TSMC snatching up more of them than any other chipmaker.\n\nEUVs require such frequent upkeep that without ASML\u2019s spare parts they quickly stop working, the people said. On-site maintenance of the EUVs poses a challenge because they\u2019re housed in clean rooms that require engineers to wear special suits to avoid contamination.\n\nASML offers certain customers joint service contracts where they do some of the routine maintenance themselves, allowing clients like TSMC to access their own machines\u2019 system. ASML says it can\u2019t access its customers\u2019 proprietary data.\n\nTSMC Chairman Mark Liu hinted in a September interview with CNN that any invader of Taiwan would find his company\u2019s chipmaking machines out of order.\n\n\u201cNobody can control TSMC by force,\u201d Liu said. \u201cIf there is a military invasion you will render TSMC factory non-operable.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Justin Sink, Mackenzie Hawkins, Nick Wadhams and Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "content": "While the innovation ecosystem has rightfully commanded much of the attention on Wall Street, investors may want to consider profitable tech stocks. As circumstances become more challenging, it\u2019s the substantive enterprises that may last for the long haul.\n\nThat\u2019s not to take anything away from the growth-oriented enterprises. Certainly, the often-smaller companies that eschew profits for expanding their market can potentially see enormous returns. At the same time, they carry tremendous risks.\n\nWith inflation still high and consumers still struggling, it may be prudent to have some exposure to established names. On that note, below are intriguing ideas for profitable tech stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Santa Clara, California, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) focuses on the infrastructure software space. Per its public profile, the company provides cybersecurity solutions worldwide. In particular, it offers firewall appliances and software. It also brings to the table Panorama, a security management solution. Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $335.32 average price target.\n\nFinancially, it\u2019s a consistent performer. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 15.53%. On a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, the company has printed net income of $2.28 billion. That said, the company just became profitable.\n\nStill, experts anticipate that the trend will continue to evolve in the right direction. For the current fiscal year, they\u2019re targeting earnings per share of $5.51 on revenue of $7.99 billion. Last year, the company posted EPS of $4.44 on sales of $6.89 billion. For fiscal 2025, earnings could rise to $6.16 on sales of $9.13 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the profitable tech stocks to consider, especially amid the rising cybersecurity threat profile.\n\nGlobalFoundries (GFS) In this photo illustration GlobalFoundries (GFS) Inc. logo is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Malta, New York, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) operates in the semiconductor space. Per its corporate profile, GlobalFoundries provides a range of mainstream wafer fabrication services and technologies worldwide. It also manufactures various semiconductor devices, including microprocessors, mobile application processors and radio frequency (RF) modems, to name but a few. Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $59.33 average price target.\n\nOn a TTM basis, GlobalFoundries features a net income of $899 million. Per Yahoo Finance, the company\u2019s profit margin stands at 12.66%. Its return on equity comes in at 8.31%. In the past four quarters since the end of the first quarter of 2024, GlobalFoundires\u2019 average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 16.38%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts believe that EPS will land at $1.34 on revenue of $6.68 billion. That\u2019s disappointing compared to last year\u2019s results of $2.24 EPS on sales of $7.39 billion. However, by fiscal 2025, the trend could improve, with EPS possibly rising to $2.07 on revenue of $7.64 billion. Given the importance of semiconductor supply chain diversification, GFS ranks among the top profitable tech stocks to buy.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nHailing from Palo Alto, California, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is another semiconductor powerhouse. Per its public profile, the company designs, develops and supplies various computer-chip-related devices with a focus on complex and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor devices and analog-based products. One of its mainline specialties involves System on Chips (SoCs). It\u2019s a strong buy, with experts projecting a price target of $1,571.55.\n\nFinancially, Broadcom isn\u2019t exactly exciting; rather, it simply gets the job done. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 2.78%. Net income on a TTM basis stands at $11.58 billion. Further, its profit margin comes in at just under 30%, with an operating margin of 31.76%.\n\nAnalysts believe that for fiscal 2024, the company will post EPS of $46.92 on revenue of $50.35 billion. That\u2019s a sizable lift from last year\u2019s print of earnings of $42.25 on sales of $35.82 billion. Further, in fiscal 2025, EPS could improve again to $57 with a top line of $57.27 billion. As a key building block in the innovation space, AVGO is one of the profitable tech stocks.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nA company that really needs no introduction, tech juggernaut Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) involves itself in myriad circles. Most recently, the company has made waves for its huge investments in artificial intelligence, which is paying off handsomely. However, Microsoft also forms the bread and butter of business applications, especially with its Office 365 software. Unsurprisingly, analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $489.90 price target.\n\nOver the past four quarters since Q1 2024, Microsoft\u2019s average positive earnings surprise stands at 6.98%. Net income on a TTM basis comes in at $86.18 billion. Currently, quarterly earnings growth is clocking in at an impressive 19.9% on a year-over-year basis. Further, its profit margin is 36.43%, with an operating margin of 44.59%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts believe EPS will rise to $10.91 on sales of $226.53 billion. That would be another decent performance compared with last year\u2019s results of $9.81 EPS on sales of $211.91 billion. Further, fiscal 2025 EPS could jump to $12.26 with a top line of $259.13 billion. It\u2019s easily one of the profitable tech stocks to buy.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nBased in the Netherlands, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) ranks as one of the most important tech enterprises. Falling under the semiconductor equipment and materials category, ASML develops, markets, sells and services advanced manufacturing systems for chipmakers. Specifically, it\u2019s best known for its lithography systems. Given the massive pertinence of the business, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy. The average price target is $1,093.50.\n\nFinancially, as you might expect, it\u2019s a consistent performer. In the past four quarters since Q1, the average quarterly earnings surprise comes in at 8.18%. On a TTM basis, net income lands at $7.11 billion. Further, the company\u2019s profit margin clocks in at 27.23%, while its operating margin is 26.3%. Notably, its return on equity shoots up to 60.28%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe that EPS will come in at $20.68 on revenue of $29.96 billion. That\u2019s somewhat disappointing compared to last year\u2019s EPS of $21.22 with a top line of $29.4 billion. However, fiscal 2025 could be a big year, with EPS flying to $32.27 on revenue of $39.7 billion. It\u2019s one of the profitable tech stocks to keep on your radar.\n\nAkamai (AKAM) building facade with akamai (AKAM) logo on it. representing tech stocks\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) specializes in the infrastructure software ecosystem. Per its corporate profile, Akamai provides cloud computing, security and content delivery services in the U.S. and international markets. Specifically, it offers cloud solutions to keep infrastructure, websites and applications protected from cyberattacks. Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $116.62 average price target.\n\nAs with other profitable tech stocks on this list, Akamai\u2019s financials aren\u2019t astounding. It gets the job done. In the past four quarters since Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average positive surprise came out to 5.48%. Net income on a TTM basis lands at $625.94 million. Profit margin is up at 16.12% while the operating margin lands at 16.97%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts are looking for EPS of $6.31 on revenue of $3.99 billion. That\u2019s a modest bump up from last year\u2019s print of $6.20 EPS on sales of $3.81 billion. However, in fiscal 2025, the bottom line could hit $6.76 per share with a top line of $4.29 billion.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nBased in San Jose, California, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a powerhouse in the infrastructure software category. Together with its subsidiaries, Adobe operates as a diversified software firm. It operates through three segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. With the gig economy expanding, the company could be an intriguing idea. Analysts believe so, rating shares a moderate buy with a $624.83 price target, implying over 29% upside potential.\n\nFinancially, Adobe\u2019s key to success is consistency rather than outright blistering performances. In the past four quarters since the three months ended Feb. 29, 2024, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise landed at just under 3%. Nominally, net income on a TTM basis reached $4.8 billion. The profit margin stands at 24.08%, with an operating margin of 36.8%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts anticipate EPS of $18.03 on revenue of $21.46 billion. That would be a sizable improvement over last year\u2019s results of $14.81 EPS on sales of $17.89 billion. Further, in fiscal 2025, EPS could rise to $20.37 on revenue of $23.93 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search ASML Holding N.V. (ASML): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "ASML (ASML) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned +3.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, which ASML falls in, has lost 3.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nASML is expected to post earnings of $3.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -12.7%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -6.9%. This estimate has changed -1.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $30.52 indicates a change of +52.3% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ASML is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ASML _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of ASML, the consensus sales estimate of $6.35 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -15.6%. The $29.43 billion and $40.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.3% and +36.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nASML reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.6%. EPS of $3.38 for the same period compares with $5.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.32%. The EPS surprise was +19.01%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nASML is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ASML. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy and Hold for a Lifetime of Profits",
        "content": "Pursuing long-term prosperity often leads one to investigate blue-chip stocks, which are industry leaders in stability, resiliency, and potential for long-term growth. Indeed, there are three major opportunities in this field. With its strategic focus on capacity expansion and technological progress, the first one may capitalize on emerging market opportunities. Moreover, its leadership in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems shows its technological superiority and revenue resilience.\n\nConversely, the second is a shining example of sound financial management and effective operations. As a cornerstone investment in the semiconductor sector, the company\u2019s dedication to shareholder returns and its planned worldwide manufacturing development strategy strengthen its reputation. It also boasts numerical solid measures, such as a gross margin and a great return on equity (ROE).\n\nLastly, the third company is leveraging AI to revolutionize user experiences and boost income through targeted advertising. Its leadership in interactive media and service monetization possibilities is driven by AI-powered recommendation systems that significantly enhance ad interaction. These companies are embracing fundamentals that have the potential to shape the industry for decades to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) focuses on strategic investments in capacity ramp and technological innovation. This is to edge on the upcoming market shifts (like AI chips). Notably, H2 2024 will be better, continuing the upward trend of the semiconductor sector. Furthermore, secular market trends and rising demand for advanced semiconductor nodes continue to support ASML\u2019s\u00a0positive\u00a0growth forecast.\n\nAdditionally, the EUV systems of ASML are essential to its ability to generate income. The business supplied 12 EUV systems in Q1 2024, bringing in EUR 1.8 billion in revenue. Furthermore, the order book shows net system bookings of EUR 3.6 billion during the same time, showing consistent demand. The industry\u2019s transition to more sophisticated semiconductor production techniques and ASML\u2019s technological capabilities are demonstrated by the growing deployment of EUV systems. Because of their higher capabilities, EUV systems fetch premium pricing, considerably boosting ASML\u2019s revenue and profit margins.\n\nLastly, the company\u2019s strong bottom line exceeded projections in Q1 2024, with a gross margin of 51%. Operational efficiency and a good product mix are credited for this profit growth. Thus, the business made EUR 1.2 billion in net profits or 23.1% of total net sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nQ1 2024 saw an improvement in TSMC\u2019s (NYSE:TSM) gross margin to 53.1% and operating margin to 42%. Further, ROE hit 25.4%, while EPS was at TWD8.7. TSMC has a competitive lead and sharp cost management, indicating solid margins and smooth operations. Fundamentally, a high ROE suggests that the company may make significant profits.\n\nMoreover, by making large expenditures in fabrication facilities located in Arizona, Japan, and Europe, TSMC is proactively growing its manufacturing footprint. Notably, 2024\u2019s capital budget may fall between\u00a0$28 billion and $32 billion. By diversifying its manufacturing sites and utilizing its global flexibility, TSMC hopes to reduce geopolitical risks. It will also improve responsiveness to customer demands and seize new growth possibilities. This development strengthens the company\u2019s lead in semiconductors and aligns with its long-term growth plan.\n\nFinally, TSMC\u2019s cash from operations in Q1 was\u00a0TWD436 billion.

        "content": "Taiwan Semi Flags High Costs of ASML's Latest Chip Machines\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), one of ASML Holding NV\u2019s (NASDAQ:ASML) significant clients, has expressed concerns about the high costs of ASML\u2019s new advanced chip machines.\n\nAt a technology symposium in Amsterdam, TSMC Senior Vice President Kevin Zhang remarked on the sticker price of the high-NA extreme ultraviolet system, which can imprint lines as thin as 8 nanometers and costs \u20ac350 million ($380 million) each, Bloomberg\u00a0reports.\n\nAlso Read: Biden Targets Chinese Imports With Huge Tariff Hikes Ahead of Election\n\nDespite appreciating the capabilities of the high-NA EUV, Zhang highlighted the economic considerations, stating that TSMC\u2019s\u00a0upcoming A16 node technology, due in late 2026, will continue to use older EUV technology instead of the new high-NA EUV machines.\n\nHe noted the rising costs of factory operations as a broader challenge for the industry, with increasing expenses for construction, tools, electricity, and raw materials.\n\nMeanwhile, TSMC is looking to build its $11 billion\u00a0European chip plant in Dresden, Germany, backed by EU and German support. The plant will produce22-nm car chips and has plans for advanced tech expansions.\n\nTSMC reported\u00a0first-quarter revenue growth of\u00a016.5% to $18.87 billion, surpassing the Street consensus estimate of $18.40 billion. Advanced technologies comprised 65% of TSMC\u2019s total revenue.\n\nReportedly, big techs led by\u00a0Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) committed over $32 billion in AI infrastructure in the first quarter alone.\n\nPrice Actions: TSM shares are trading higher by 0.37% at $152.50 premarket\u00a0at the last check on Wednesday.

        "content": "(Adds quote, more detail and background from paragraph 2, 4-9)\n\nAMSTERDAM, May 14 (Reuters) - Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC does not necessarily need to use ASML's next generation \"High NA EUV\" machines for its new chip manufacturing technology called A16, which is under development for 2027, an executive said on Tuesday.\n\nThe High NA lithography tools are expected to help shrink chip designs by up to two-thirds, but chipmakers must weigh that benefit against a higher cost and whether older tech may be more reliable and good enough.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in Amsterdam, Kevin Zhang said that it is possible that the company's A16 plants could be designed to accommodate the technology, but that is not certain. TSMC is the largest user of ASML's regular EUV machines.\n\n\"I like the technology but I don't like the sticker price\", Zhang told reporters.\n\nHigh NA tools are expected to cost more than 350 million euros ($378 million) each, from 200 million euros from ASML's regular EUV machines.\n\nASML, Europe's largest tech firm, dominates the market for lithography systems, machines that use beams of light to help create the circuitry of chips.\n\nLithography is one of many technologies chipmakers use to improve chips, but it is a limiting factor in how small the features on a chip can be - smaller means faster and more energy efficient.\n\nIntel last month said it had become the first company to assemble one of ASML's new High NA EUV lithography tools, as an important part of the U.S. computer chip maker's drive to outshine rivals.\n\n($1 = 0.9262 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling, editing by Bart Meijer and Emelia Sithoel-Matarise)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "China's Semiconductor Spending Tops US With $142B Commitment: Global Chip Race Heats Up\n\nGaining control over the global supply of chips is becoming a central priority for Western governments trying to compete with China in the race to dominate the industry.\n\nPandemic-related disruptions showed how a lack of semiconductors can negatively impact a vast number of industries. Now more than ever, securing a steady flow of chips is being placed atop geopolitical strategies worldwide.\n\nThis is part of the reasoning behind a long list of sizable investments that governments are pouring on their domestic building capabilities. Subsidies are expected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming decade.\n\nBiden Pushes Hard: In the U.S., incentives for the semiconductor industry already amount to $32.8 billion as part of President Joe Biden's far-reaching CHIPS Act in an effort to boost jobs, gain independence from Asian production and improve the administration's image ahead of the presidential election.\n\nOn Monday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said it's \"critically important for the United States to have a role in strategic industries,\" including semiconductors.\n\nMicron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) are among U.S. companies poised to benefit from measures coming from the CHIPS Act.\n\nAnother $39 billion in subsidies have been promised by the government, along with $75 billion in loans and tax breaks for companies in the sector, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe administration's strategy to bolster the chips industry also includes several export restrictions on China, along with international lobbying efforts with European partners aimed at limiting China's access to key technology needed to develop the most advanced semiconductors.\n\nEarlier this year, ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML), a Dutch company producing machines that are vital in the development of advanced semiconductors, raised concerns over its place at the center of a broader geopolitical conflict between China and the U.S.\n\nExport controls by the U.S. on China are affecting some of its largest players. Last week, China\u2019s top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corpreported its worst margin since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe U.S. government has recently revoked export licenses that previously allowed Intel and Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), to supply essential chips to Shenzhen-based Huawei.\n\nRead also: Samsung Secures $6.4B from US for Texas Chip Factory After Nvidia Supplier TSMC\u2019s Breakthrough\n\nChina's $142B Response: For its part, China is also funneling billions into reaching semiconductor sovereignty. The exact figure is unclear since the Chinese government doesn't make those numbers public, yet an estimate from the Semiconductor Industry Association puts the figure at $142 billion between executed and planned financing.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, China now has more semiconductor fabs under construction than any other country. The country's massive efforts are born out of a need to compensate for restricted access to U.S. and European-made equipment, without which manufacturing the most complex semiconductors still remains impossible.\n\nIn her Monday interview, Yellen also warned against possible overflows in specific industries after \"enormous subsidies in critical areas of advanced manufacturing has resulted in overcapacity,\" in China.\n\nThat's the main concern behind the recent wave of stimulus spreading across the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIndia, Japan and Europe Also Want In: In Europe, several plans have been unveiled to pour billions into the industry, including a wide-ranging initiative from the European Union as well as specific state-backed programs.\n\nThe European Chips Act will \"mobilize more than \u20ac43 billion ($46 billion) of public and private investments and set measures to prepare, anticipate and swiftly respond to any future supply chain disruptions, together with Member States and international partners,\" according to an official press release.\n\nGermany, France and The Netherlands have already spent a collective $24 billion in subsidies while several more billions have been proposed in Spain, Italy and the UK.\n\nOver in Asia, the biggest state-backed investments so far come from Japan, where $16 billion of a total planned of $64 billion have been allocated, and India where $7 billion have been allocated from a $10 billion government fund.\n\nThe largest U.S.-listed ETFs following the semiconductor industry by total assets are VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) and Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:SOXL)\n\nNow read: SoftBank\u2019s Billion-Dollar Bet: Switching From Startups To Semiconductors, AI\n\nShutterstock image.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article China's Semiconductor Spending Tops US With $142B Commitment: Global Chip Race Heats Up originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0Billionaire Ken Fisher Loves These 10 AI Stocks. If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list,\u00a0click Billionaire Ken Fisher Loves These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nEarlier this month, billionaire Ken Fisher, while talking to Bloomberg, said that in his career spanning 50 years he never spent a \"moment\" thinking or worrying about what the central banks \"might do.\"\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher Says He Doesn't Waste a \"Moment\" Worrying About Fed Moves\n\nWhy? Because Fisher said he's \"always believed\" that \"they are just about as crazy and out of their minds as you can be.\"\n\nFisher, 73, said that the central bank management \"never\" knows what to do as it's reactive. To drive this point home, Fisher reminded everyone that just a month before the Fed's first 75bps rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said that he was not even \"thinking about\" raising rates by 75bps.\n\nFisher Says Some Threats and \"Big Surprises\" are Not Priced In\n\nKen Fisher has been bullish on the economy over the past several months. Rate hikes, the inflation storm, banking crisis and global uncertainty did not waver Fisher's belief that we will come out of this crisis unscathed. But in his latest interview Fisher voiced concerns about some of the threats he believes are not yet \"priced in.\" Fisher is worried about \"big surprises\" that can impact global stocks and global GDP. Fisher said in financial markets everyone is usually worried about more or less the same things. But sometimes threats can slip through the cracks and we don\u2019t see them coming. Ken Fisher said a classic example of this surprise is mark-to-market accounting rules implemented in 2007 which \"hugely took the mortgage problem and amplified it to write $2 trillion off of global bank balance sheets.\"\n\nHowever, Fisher reiterated that he's bullish on the market right now.\n\n\"But whenever I am bullish I am still looking for risks.\"\n\nFisher Is Worried About a Nuclear War in Asia\n\nFisher's worries about the geopolitical chessboard stem from what he called the nuclear-armed triangle: China, India and Pakistan. Fisher said these three nations have different economies, politics and culture and they \"usually don\u2019t like each other.\" While Fisher thinks the odds of war in the region are not high, he doesn\u2019t think such a war is \"impossible\" and fears any conflict between the nuclear powers in Asia would be \"catastrophic.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nKen Fisher's Favorite Sectors\n\nWhen asked about what sectors he's looking as bargains, Fisher said he wouldn\u2019t call them \"bargains\" because \"valuations don\u2019t usually tell you much about short to intermediate term stock price direction.\"\n\nInstead, Fisher is looking for sectors that would do \"pretty well\" in a moderate growth economy with a \"slowly decelerating inflation\" environment.\"\n\nFisher likes energy and high-end consumer luxury goods sectors. He also said that while healthcare hasn\u2019t been in a market-leading position, he expects \"big healthcare\" stocks to start becoming \"better and better.\" Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher\n\nBubble or Not? \"It's The Garbage That Tells You\"\n\nAsked whether he believes the tech stock rally of 2024 is a bubble, Fisher talked about a \"telltale\" sign that we can use to find out whether we are in a bubble or not. Fisher said that when \"garbage\", low-quality IPOs start to flood the market, you should start worrying about a bubble. Fisher said high-quality company stocks making new highs, backed by revenue and profit growth, is not what you call a bubble.\u00a0 Fisher highlighted that after the \"SPAC world of 2021,\" 2023 saw the lowest volume IPO market since 1984.\n\n\"And that tells you we are not anywhere close to an actual bubble.\"\n\nFisher Investments Likes Q1 Earnings\n\nFisher Investments in a latest posted talked about how positive Q1 earnings were and said the latest numbers show the market returns were broadening out and the firm's bullish outlook was confirmed.\n\n\"With 427 companies having reported as we write, the blended earnings growth rate is 5.5% y/y.This figure, for those who don\u2019t have their financial jargon glossary handy, blends actual results for the 427 reporting firms with estimates for the remaining dozens. So while the stragglers could pull the headline rate down some, it seems safe enough to say earnings grew for the third straight quarter. Growth was broad-based, too, with 8 of 11 sectors growing and only Materials, Energy and Health Care in the red. Communication Services led the charge at 35.8% y/y, driven by whopping 70.2% growth in its Interactive Media and Services industry. Pair this with Tech\u2019s 22.7% y/y and Consumer Discretionary\u2019s 24.0%\u2014led by e-commerce\u2014and it seems clear to us the Tech and Tech-like firms leading the charge during this bull market are doing so for concrete reasons, not just AI hype and other associated faddish chatter. Yet the more value-oriented Industrials (6.7% y/y) and Financials (7.2%) also did well, underscoring the bull market\u2019s underappreciated breadth.\"\n\nFor this article we scanned Fisher Investments' Q1'2024 portfolio and picked its biggest AI-related holdings. With each stock we have mentioned Fisher's stake. \u00a0Why is it important to pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nKen Fisher's Q1'2024 Stake: $2,742,649,339\n\nMeta Platforms Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0is using AI to increase engagement on its platforms. Meta Platforms Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0recently talked about its AI-spending plans:\n\n\"We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 billion to $99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect CapEx will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We\u2019re seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year\u2019s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.\u201d\n\n9. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nKen Fisher's Q1'2024 Stake: $2,873,725,266\n\nBroadcom Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0is one of the best AI stocks to buy according to Ken Fisher. Citi in a recent note reiterated its Buy rating on Broadcom Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0along with some other semiconductor stocks as the firm is bullish on the industry amid the rise in sales in March.\n\n\"This data, together with recent commentary from the analog companies, support our view of an analog inventory replenishment in 2H24, and we remain bullish on the group,\" Citi analyst Christopher Danely said.\n\nCarillon Eagle Growth & Income Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) traded higher after closing on its acquisition of VMware. The company also announced earnings that were relatively in line with estimates with some benefit of better operating expenses. The stock appears to be one of the first real beneficiaries of generative artificial intelligence (AI) with meaningful revenue expected to show up in 2024.\u201d\n\n8. ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nKen Fisher's Q1'2024 Stake: $3,007,951,821\n\nNetherlands-based ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the top semiconductor stocks to own for the AI revolution since ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) supplies ultraviolet lithography photolithography machines used to manufacture \u00a0advanced 3nm and 5nm chips. Jim Kelleher of Argus has set a \u00a0$1,000 price target on the stock.\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNetherlands-based\u00a0ASML Holding N.V.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in ASML Holding implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 35% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of ASML Holding N.V. (AMS:ASML), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 58% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of ASML Holding.\n\nSee our latest analysis for ASML Holding  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ASML Holding?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that ASML Holding does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see ASML Holding's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in ASML Holding. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. With 3.9% and 2.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Norges Bank Investment Management are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of ASML Holding\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur information suggests that ASML Holding N.V. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own \u20ac74m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 42% stake in ASML Holding. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand ASML Holding better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified  1 warning sign for ASML Holding that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: Super Micro Computer vs. ASML",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) represent two different ways to invest in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, is one of the world's fastest growing producers of dedicated AI servers. ASML is the world's largest manufacturer of high-end lithography systems, which are used to produce high-end chips for Nvidia, AMD, and other leading chipmakers.\n\nOver the past 12 months, Supermicro's stock has rallied more than 480% as ASML's stock advanced 42%. Let's see why Supermicro outperformed ASML by such a wide margin -- and if it will generate bigger gains for the foreseeable future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe differences between Supermicro and ASML\n\nSupermicro builds high-performance servers which can process tasks more efficiently than traditional servers. Through a longtime partnership, Nvidia grants Supermicro access to its top-tier data center GPUs before its larger competitors.\n\nBy the end of fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), Supermicro was generating more than half of its revenue from its dedicated AI servers. Many data center operators scrambled to install those servers to address the soaring popularity of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nSupermicro controls a much smaller slice of the server market than Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. However, Bank of America expects Supermicro's share of the dedicated AI server market to rise from 10% to 17% within the next three years as the market expands by 150%.\n\nASML's lithography systems are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems which are used to produce the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips. These systems cost about $200 million each and require multiple planes to ship.\n\nThe world's most advanced chipmakers -- TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- all use ASML's EUV systems to produce their top-tier chips. Therefore, TSMC couldn't manufacture Nvidia's latest data center GPUs, AMD's newest CPUs, and other advanced chips without ASML's EUV systems.\n\nThe indispensable nature of ASML's lithography systems makes it linchpin of the global semiconductor market, but tighter export curbs are now preventing it from selling its higher-end systems to Chinese chipmakers. Supermicro's sales of AI servers in China have also been throttled by the ongoing tech war between the U.S. and China.\n\nWhich company is growing faster?\n\nSupermicro's revenue rose 46% in fiscal 2022 and 37% in fiscal 2023 as the market's insatiable demand for new AI servers outstripped its available supply. Analysts expect its revenue to soar another 110% this year and grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 as it expands its share of the AI server market.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML's revenue grew 14% in 2022 and 30% in 2023. It also benefited from the expansion of the AI market, but a lot of that growth was offset by the post-pandemic weakness of the smartphone and PC markets. Therefore, ASML is a more diversified play on the broader semiconductor market than a high-growth AI stock.\n\nAnalysts expect ASML's revenue to stay flat this year as it grapples with the export curbs in China, but they expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 13% from 2023 to 2026 as it rolls out its next-gen EUV systems for making even smaller chips.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Supermicro's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 50%. They expect ASML's EPS to rise at a CAGR of 20% from 2023 to 2026. Based on those estimates, Supermicro trades at 25 times forward earnings while ASML has a much higher forward price-to-earnings ratio of 44.\n\nSupermicro might look more expensive than traditional server makers like Dell and HPE, but it's also growing faster than both of its larger competitors. It also seems reasonably valued relative to other high-growth AI stocks like Nvidia. ASML is trading at a premium to many other semiconductor equipment makers because it's monopolized the EUV market, has plenty of pricing power, and remains a top bellwether of the growing semiconductor sector.\n\nThe better AI stock: Supermicro\n\nSupermicro and ASML are both solid long-term investments, but Supermicro's higher growth rates, tighter focus on the AI market, and lower valuations all make it a more compelling investment than ASML right now. ASML's stock could also gradually head higher, but its near-term gains could be limited until its revenue growth accelerates again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "ASML (ASML) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned -8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, which ASML falls in, has lost 6.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ASML is expected to post earnings of $3.86 per share, indicating a change of -28.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -12.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.04 points to a change of -6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $30.52 indicates a change of +52.3% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ASML.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ASML _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor ASML, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.35 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -15.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.43 billion and $40.1 billion estimates indicate -1.3% and +36.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nASML reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.6%. EPS of $3.38 for the same period compares with $5.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.32%. The EPS surprise was +19.01%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nASML is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ASML. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Chip Stocks on Sale: 3 Semiconductor Plays to Buy the Dip",
        "content": "Chip stocks pulled back following an earnings report by ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), a prominent semiconductor manufacturing equipment developer, which said it expects its bookings to see a significant 61% sequential decrease in the first quarter.\n\nThis downturn surpassed what investors had anticipated, causing concern in the semiconductor market. This slowdown in equipment purchases by foundries, that manufacture chips for companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could indicate a potential downturn in the semiconductor industry, which is what is hurting chip stocks lately.\n\nThe semiconductor sector was further shaken by a global retreat in semiconductor stocks, prompted by profit-taking after TSMC revised its chip market growth forecast downwards. The revision by TSMC, from over 10% to 10% growth for the global logic semiconductor industry, is fueling concerns over the demand for chips used in various technologies including electric vehicles, computers, and smartphones.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the latest pullback, let\u2019s look at three chip stocks investors may want to buy on dips.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) produces DRAM, flash memory, and SSDs, which are essential for everything from smartphones to data centers. This positive performance has made Micron a standout in the broader chip stocks category.\n\nInvestors should use the recent pullback in Micron as an opportunity.\n\nMicron reported an unexpected profit for its second quarter, signaling a quicker-than-anticipated recovery in the memory chip market. It also transitioned to a profit of $793 million. That was a substantial turnaround from the $2.31 billion loss reported in the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company earned 71 cents per share, defying analysts\u2019 expectations of a per-share loss of 41 cents, according to polls by FactSet. Adjusted earnings per share stood at 42 cents, outperforming the consensus forecast of a 25-cent loss.\n\nThe company enjoyed a 58% increase in revenue, reaching $5.82 billion, which surpassed analyst predictions. In addition, Micron\u2019s Chief Executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, attributed this success to the company\u2019s effective execution in terms of pricing, products, and operations.\n\nLooking ahead, the company\u2019s revenue forecast ranges from $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion, which exceeds the consensus expectations of $6 billion. This optimistic outlook further underscores the company\u2019s recovery trajectory in the competitive memory chip market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) used to be known for creating powerful graphics chips for gaming PCs and workstations. However, the unprecedented demand for high-end AI chips is what propelled the company\u2019s market capitalization to over $2 trillion at one point.\n\nWithin a single year, Nvidia gained a 260% valuation boost, increasing its market cap by $1.6 trillion. That is more than double the combined market cap of Nvidia\u2019s three closest competitors. Their chips accelerate tasks in AI, data science, and self-driving cars.\n\nNvidia shares are already up 77% but were recently trading below highs following a pullback in the chip sector. Still, investors are very likely to continue seeing Nvidia as the clear artificial intelligence (AI) winner as long as the company can maintain its ~90% market share in this market.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock was also boosted when Citi analysts opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on the chipmaker. According to the firm, recent supply chain checks showed that Nvidia\u2019s visibility has extended into 1H25, which makes it a long-term core portfolio holding.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), is a big name in high-performance server tech. The company designs and sells servers, storage, and other hardware needed for data centers and powerful computing systems. As part of the broader chip stocks sector, SMCI\u2019s role is crucial for advanced computing needs.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock fell as much as 23% in a single day in April after the maker of servers announced the date of its third-quarter results but didn\u2019t pre-announce results. This disappointed investors as they were hoping SMCI could opt to pre-announcer results amid better-than-expected performance in the first quarter.\n\nNevertheless, the SMCI\u2019s strong fundamental profile remains intact. The selloff is more connected to heightened investor expectations than to the change in the company\u2019s performance. In recent months, SMCI stock has rallied on the back of the generative AI boom. Investors see SMCI well-positioned amid strong demand for its AI-centric server technology.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you\u2019re searching for stocks to outperform the S&P 500, look no further. Some stocks are more solid than others against market downturns and macro-economic uncertainty and have high chances of beating the S&P 500 index. Three of these stocks are listed here because of their fundamental resilience to market turbulence and their track record of steady performance. These companies have a lead across industries, including technology, healthcare, and consumer staples. They have certain traits that make them appealing investment choices during trying times.\n\nThe first demonstrates a substantial increase in organic sales throughout various geographic areas. This indicates consistent customer demand and successful marketing tactics. The second one is impressive due to its cutting-edge pharmaceutical section. This\u00a0shows significant income streams and encourages development potential in therapeutic areas like cancer. Significant order bookings were made for the third one. This\u00a0demonstrates the high demand for its cutting-edge lithography technique and offers future revenue predictability.\n\nThese businesses stand out for more reasons than just their track record; they also exhibit resilience and strategic flexibility in adversity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Outperform the S&P 500: Procter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has demonstrated a fundamentally progressive trajectory of organic sales growth in several geographical regions. Notably, over the last four quarters (Q3 fiscal 2024), North America has had a constant volume growth trend. This has supported a 3% increase in organic sales (in Q3), indicating a persistent customer demand.\n\nSimilarly, Procter & Gamble\u2019s growth in market share within its target regions is impressive. Focus markets in Europe, for example, had a vital\u00a07% gain in organic sales over the previous three months, supported by a 1% rise in value share. This increasing market share trend indicates Procter & Gamble\u2019s successful tactics in identifying customer preferences and boosting sales growth in strategic areas.\n\nDespite economic difficulties throughout Latin America, especially in Argentina due to a\u00a0large\u00a0currency depreciation, Procter & Gamble achieved a solid\u00a017% increase in organic sales. Effective pricing techniques to counter currency swings were primarily responsible for this growth.\n\nOverall, there are adversities in some markets, such as Greater China and portions of Europe and Asia Pacific. However, Procter & Gamble may sustain positive volume growth in these areas.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe progressiveness of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) medicine segment\u00a0is based\u00a0on its array of products. With $13.6 billion in global sales (Q1 2024), the category has a sizable top-line. Notably, operational sales growth, removing the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, is at an exceptional 8.3%, even with a 4% fall outside of the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, the company\u2019s considerable expansion in this market indicates that its concentration on oncology is paying off. TECVAYLI, CARVYKTI, and DARZALEX all show impressive sales gains over the prior year. For example, revenues at TECVAYLI increased from\u00a0$63 million to $133 million. This demonstrates a successful introduction in the context of relapsed refractory material. Comparably, CARVYKTI\u2019s revenues increased by more than double, from $72 million to $157 million. This results from increased capacity, sharp manufacturing practices, and strong demand.\n\nFinally, Johnson & Johnson has progressed beyond cancer to other therapeutic fields, such as immunology and pulmonary hypertension. Hence, the company\u2019s solid lead in this market\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in its\u00a022.4% rise in sales of pulmonary hypertension, driven by the favorable patient mix, share gains, and market growth for OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nStrong demand for ASML\u2019s (NASDAQ:ASML) products reflects its impressive order bookings, which totaled \u20ac3.6 billion in Q1 2024 alone. The backlog provides revenue visibility and stability for the next quarters and at the end of Q1 2024, it was estimated to be over \u20ac38 billion. Thus, ASML\u2019s ability to secure orders well in advance is reflected in the significant backlog, which lays a strong foundation for sustainable growth.\n\nMoreover, ASML predicts increased revenue in 2024, especially in its EUV division.\u00a0This\u00a0is indicative of the growing use of advanced lithography technology. The NXE 3800E has been released, which offers notable performance gains over earlier versions. Furthermore, ASML is focusing on developing lithography technology to satisfy future semiconductor node requirements, meeting the needs of both logic and memory clients, reflected in the delivery of high-NA systems.\n\nLastly, EUV customers\u2019 anticipated shift to the NXE:3800E highlights ASML\u2019s capacity to please and hold onto its clientele by providing improved solutions. Overall, ASML\u2019s proactive approach to engaging clients and easing their transition to advanced lithography technologies has resulted in high customer interest in the High NA Systems Lab.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in JNJ and ASML.

        "content": "At one point Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was in official correction territory. Shares were down more than 20% on fears of a slowing artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Not that the fears had any basis in fact. It was only because Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) failed to provide preliminary financial results when announcing its earnings release date that caused the stock to slide.\n\nIt indicated that investors were worried about Nvidia\u2019s valuation. Having come so far so fast, the chipmaker was trading at nosebleed valuations. At such times, any sort of tremor in the marketplace can shake an overvalued stock\u2019s foundation\u2019s.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock has mostly bounced back, up about 13%, it still has a ways to go before reaching a new, all-time high. Also, it means investors might bail on it again at a moment\u2019s notice. You may want to protect your downside by seeking out new AI stocks to grab now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBecause the chipmaker\u2019s stock still carries lofty valuations, consider the three stocks below to make a windfall.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nMost investors know Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a premier chip stock for mobile handsets. But few realize that QCOM is an AI beast. Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip released last year powers the AI capabilities on Android phones like Samsung\u2018s Galaxy S24 series and smartphones from China\u2019s OnePlus and Xiaomi.\n\nAlso, the Snapdragon chip can support dozens of generative AI models. Those include Meta Platform\u2018s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet\u2018s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Gemini. That suggests the chip can also make its way into lower cost phones and introduce the language models into their phones. We know Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to use Gemini in its next iteration of the iPhone.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful Qualcomm can achieve the same market valuation as Nvidia, if for no other reason than the growth trajectories of the various markets they target. However, as AI trickles down throughout technology ecosystems, more and varied uses for Qualcomm\u2019s chips will become apparent. And because QCOM stock offers investors a better stock valuation than its rival, investors will reap a windfall grabbing its shares now.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nData centers are going to be a major component for the next phase of AI growth. Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) should be a prime beneficiary. Hyperscalers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are relying upon data centers for their cloud computing services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Arista Networks makes the servers, routers, switches and network operating software data centers rely upon. The stock took a big hit earlier this month after an analyst said it would face increased competition from Nvidia. Not usually considered a rival, Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of Mellanox several years ago positions it to enter the market.\n\nYet, Arista Networks counts all major hyperscalers as customers, primarily Meta and Microsoft, both seeking ways to become less reliant upon Nvidia. And Meta\u2019s recent earnings proclamation that it plans to spend $35 billion to $40 billion on AI should see a lot of that money fall to Arista Networks.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe last stock investors should consider running off with for windfall profits is ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML). The Netherlands-based manufacturer of specialized chip equipment is a literal monopoly on certain high-end machines needed for producing AI chips.\n\nASML is the world\u2019s only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung are all customers buying the equipment to produce the advanced AI chips customers need. TSM, of course, is the world\u2019s biggest foundry and counts Nvidia as a major customer.\n\nThe equipment manufacturer anticipates demand growing through 2025. And this year will be the first time ever ASML pre-builds its inventory in anticipation of future orders. Having supply on hand will shorten lead time and improve efficiency. If AI is going to grow, it is going to need ASML\u2019s equipment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "While the broader stock market can often be unpredictable, investors continue their search for unstoppable tech stocks for big gains in 2024. Among the top contenders are companies harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, renewable energy and e-commerce.\n\nOften characterized by their significant growth potential and established market positioning, these tech giants demonstrate an unwavering ability to thrive in the face of adversity. Moreover, they have a sound track record of reporting strong revenue and earnings growth over the years. As the digital revolution accelerates, these top unstoppable tech stocks will continue to shape the future.\n\nNow, here are the top three unstoppable tech stocks for big gains in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Dutch company with a unique footing and dominance in a critical part of the semiconductor industry. They manufacture extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, a complex technology essential for producing cutting-edge chips for smartphones, computers and AI applications.\n\nThe company is special due to its unique patents and exclusive rights to EUV lithography systems. There are only a handful of companies that have access to these machines, and their monopoly in the market makes ASML an extremely important company. The global chip shortage, which started during the pandemic, has been a positive for ASML. That is because demand remained high for its EUV systems, granting the company significant pricing power. In FY23, ASML delivered a record revenue of $27.6 billion. EPS skyrocketed 41% year-over-year (YOY) to $19.91 per share, with gross margins above street estimates. While this year is labeled as a \u2018\u2019transition year,\u2019\u2019 management expects a stronger second half of 2024.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) remains one of the best unstoppable tech stocks for big gains in 2024. While operating in a different semiconductor segment than ASML, Applied Materials specializes in tools and equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors.\n\nApplied Materials plays a crucial role in the multi-step process of chip production. The company benefits tremendously from the continued expansion in chip manufacturing by some of the biggest industry players like TSMC (NYSE:TSM), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Over the past 12 to 18 months, the wafer fabrication market saw a huge drop in spending. That inevitably impacted Applied Materials, which is a major beneficiary of this high barrier to entry market. However, it was able to weather the storm, and a rebound in the semiconductor equipment market is underway. In the 2023 fiscal year, revenue increased 3% YOY to $26.5 billion. EPS increased 9% YOY to a record $8.11 per share, with FCF up 65% to $7.6 billion. The turn of the semiconductor cycle is brewing, and Applied Materials valuation leaves a ton of room for growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is the undisputed e-commerce leader in Latin America. Often referred to as \u201cthe Amazon of Latin America,\u201d MercadoLibre is on pace to deliver outsized returns over the next decade.\n\nThe company built a comprehensive ecosystem encompassing online marketplaces, its own payment solution (Mercado Pago) and a robust logistics network. Latin America\u2019s growing middle class and internet usage provide a solid runway for accelerated growth in e-commerce adoption. Additionally, the company\u2019s improving financial performance will be the catalyst to send shares soaring. In FY23, revenue increased an astonishing 37% YOY to $14.47 billion. Net income swelled 104% YOY to $987 million, nearly eclipsing the $1 billion mark. Moreover, the operating margin expanded by 280 bps, with FCF hitting a record $4.63 billion. MercadoLibre is making all the right moves, and its expansive ecosystem and dominance in LATAM make it well-positioned for long-term success.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Toby Sterling\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ASML's new boss Christophe Fouquet faces a tricky balancing act in helping to steer Europe's biggest tech company through the US/China \"chip war\", while maintaining the group's lead over rivals and managing the current AI boom.\n\nFouquet, whose appointment as CEO was approved at the semiconductor equipment maker's annual meeting on Wednesday, inherits a company that is profitable and dominant in its field, but potential pitfalls abound.\n\nExport restrictions imposed by the United States and the Netherlands mean the upper half of ASML's product range cannot be sold in China, one of its biggest markets.\n\nAs Fouquet takes over, ASML is riding high with a lofty stock market valuation, reflecting optimistic expectations but there are risks of disappointment amid a product rollout and capacity expansion.\n\nOutgoing CEO Peter Wennink, who presided over a more than tenfold rise in the company's market valuation to 320 billion euros ($340 billion) over the past decade, said in a farewell address ASML's expansion will continue under Fouquet.\n\nThe global semiconductor industry has grown to $600 billion in annual sales in a 50-year history, but, Wennink said, \"in the next six to eight years, we need to almost double that. This is why we need to build capacity. This is why our customers will grow ... and that's why ASML will grow.\"\n\nFouquet will have to maintain ASML's position as the dominant vendor of its lithography systems, which use beams of light to create the circuitry of chips, to the likes of Taiwan's TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.\n\nLithography makes up about a third of the $100 million chip equipment market, and ASML has a market share above 90%, analysts say, as it is the only company with \"EUV\" lithography, used to make all of the world's most advanced chips.\n\nCompetitors for older generations of \"DUV\" lithography include Japan's Nikon and Canon, but Fouquet will also have to watch Chinese lithography company SMEE and others that may emerge.\n\nCHINA RESTRICTIONS\n\nChinese chipmakers have big incentives to develop alternatives to ASML machines they cannot buy under U.S.-led restrictions. These have become a headache for ASML since 2018, as Washington seeks to limit Beijing's ability to make its own advanced chips.\n\nChinese chipmakers are expanding capacity to make older chips that do not fall under restrictions, agitating Washington and Brussels. China was ASML's second-largest market by sales in 2023.\n\nIn addition, China's chipmakers will continue to improve the quality of chips they can make using ASML's DUV equipment. ASML cannot sell EUV tools in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nFouquet explained to shareholders Wednesday that using DUV instead of EUV tools becomes more and more inefficient as chips get more advanced, until it is prohibitively expensive.\n\nSo \"technically you can, economically you can't. I think that's the short answer,\" Fouquet said, an argument he must also make to governments seeking further restrictions.\n\nFouquet oversaw ASML's EUV programmes in 2018-2022, including the development of the new $375 million \"High NA\" EUV machine currently being tested by Intel expected to support sales growth into the 2030s.\n\nA source who has worked with Fouquet described him as able to keep people talking even when pressure on a key supplier to improve its technology and triple its output at the same time led to fierce arguments.\n\n\"He understands the technology, he understands the business and then also he understands how to make things work\" across U.S. designers, European suppliers, and Asian customers, the source said.\n\nFouquet, a trained physicist, will need his diplomatic skills, especially if Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidency in November with an unpredictable impact on China policy.\n\nASML'S RISE\n\nASML grew from 13,000 employees in 2014 to 43,000 at present - and on Monday the company unveiled plans for a new facility in Eindhoven to house another 20,000 staff.\n\nThe company's stock is priced at 40 times 2023 earnings, slightly ahead of other top chip equipment suppliers such as Applied Materials and KLA. Fouquet worked at both earlier in his career.\n\nInvestor Nick Rossolillo, who hosts the Chip Stock Investor podcast and has owned ASML shares since 2022, said one concern is that governments are supporting construction of new chip plants in U.S., Japan, Europe, China, South Korea and Taiwan.\n\n\"Government subsidies are fantastic for ... equipment providers like ASML during this construction boom. But what happens in 2028-30 when all that extra capacity comes online?\" Rossolillo said.\n\n($1 = 0.9349 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Jane Merriman)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Data analytics company GlobalData projects that the AI market will grow 35% annually over the next few years, reaching $909 billion by 2030. Naturally, that\u2019s made AI chip stocks extremely popular with investors.\n\nGoogle the words \u201cAI chip stocks\u201d in quotation marks, and you will get 39,600 results. AI is undoubtedly a priority subject for investors at the moment.\n\nOn April 1, Barron\u2019s reported that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI plan to build a $100 billion AI data center, an investment equal to Microsoft\u2019s capital spending over the past four years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors are stocked because the AI chips required to power such a large data center would be enormous. That\u2019s good news for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and every other major AI player.\n\nBank of America\u2019s Global Research analyst Vivek Arya has buy ratings on Nvidia and four other AI chip stocks. I\u2019d normally include Nvidia in any AI-related recommendation, but I\u2019ll go with three that he does not mention in his article.\n\nTo make my selection, I looked at the Horizons Global Semiconductor Index ETF\u2019s holdings, which trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Flag of the Republic of China or Taiwan on a processor, CPU Central processing Unit or GPU microchip on a motherboard. Taiwan manufacturing chip industry emerges as battlefront in US - China showdown. TSM stock\n\nSource: William Potter / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019ll admit that my picks aren\u2019t the most original. However, that doesn\u2019t make them any less actionable.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) makes the cut because of its commitment to American manufacturing. TSM is building an Arizona plant that will go live in 2025. The company also plans to start making its most advanced chips beginning in 2028. By 2030, it plans to open three fabrication plants in the U.S., which would cost the company $65 billion to get them up and running.\n\nNow, big business gets done with some help from the federal government, which is chipping in $11.6 billion in grants and loans. That pales compared to the nearly $20 billion being thrown Intel\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) way under the CHIPS Act, intended to bring 20% of the world\u2019s advanced semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S.\n\nI\u2019ve always thought globalization worked best when companies manufactured products in the country where the products are intended to be sold. Good for TSM.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAs I write this, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) stock is falling. The Dutch chip maker reported weaker-than-expected sales in Q1 2024.\n\nAnalysts expected revenue of 5.39 billion euros ($5.73 billion), but ASML delivered 5.29 billion euros ($5.63 billion), 2% shy of the mark. However, its net income was 1.22 billion euros ($1.30 billion), 14% higher than Wall Street\u2019s predictions.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML produces extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which are used to make technologically advanced chips. Lower consumer demand for smartphones and laptops has had a knock-on effect on the company\u2019s revenues.\u00a0Sales and profits were down 21.6% and 37.4% in Q1 2024, respectively. Bookings were also down 4% year over year.\n\nDespite the miss, ASML reiterated its 2024 guidance for revenue. Similar to 2023, it suggests that 2025 will be its breakout year as both TSM and Intel increase their U.S. production.\n\n\u201cI think by 2025 you will see all three of those coming together. New fab openings, strong secular trends and the industry in the midst of its upturn,\u201d said CFO Roger Dassen in an interview for CNBC.\n\nASML is a buy below $900.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5G\n\nSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is up more than 19% year to date and more than 49% since November lows.\n\nQualcomm launched AI Hub in early March. It includes over 75 popular AI and generative AI language learning models such as Whisper, ControlNet, Stable Diffusion and Baichuan 7B, which will provide developers with high performance and low power consumption when creating applications.\n\nIn a February interview from the 2024 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Akash Palkhiwala spoke with Yahoo Finance host Brad Smith about Qualcomm\u2019s AI Hub\u2019s role in generative AI.\n\n\u201cAnd you could take those models, build it into an application, test it on a device, and deploy it into an application store, all in one go right at the website. So it just makes it very easy for the developers to take advantage of the hardware that we\u2019ve put forward. And we\u2019re excited that this broadens the reach of our products. And it makes it very easy for developers to access them.\u201d\n\nSmartphone makers will launch devices with full AI capabilities integrated into them in 2024 and 2025. Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip will help manufacturers deliver these capabilities.\n\nThis is a big positive for the company and its stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Thus, the program expansion demonstrates this and solidifies its standing as card issuers\u2019 preferred partner.\n\nTSMC (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe quick action taken by TSMC (NYSE:TSM) in the wake of the April 3 earthquake exemplifies its operational resilience and risk management skills. Notwithstanding the effects of the earthquake, TSMC recovered all of its tools at the end of the third day. The company had recovered almost 70% of them in the first ten hours. This quick recovery reduces the chance of income losses and minimizes production interruptions.\n\nMoreover, Wafer scraps and material loss are the main causes of TSMC\u2019s assessment of the earthquake\u2019s overall impact on the second-quarter gross margin, which is around 0.50%. Stakeholders may evaluate TSMC\u2019s financial performance to determine the extent of the incident by quantifying its financial impact.\n\nFurthermore, TSMC\u2019s focus on scientific improvement\u00a0is shown\u00a0in its development of 2-nanometer technology (N2) and its\u00a0projected volume production in 2025. Thus, N2\u2019s expected use in AI-related applications puts TSMC in a\u00a0solid\u00a0position to develop in high-value markets.\n\nOverall, TSMC\u2019s observations of considerable customer interest in N2 and its projections for additional tape-outs indicate strong market demand for advanced nodes. This interaction with customers highlights TSMC\u2019s position as an industry pioneer and proves its technology leadership.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nIn Q1 2024, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) had net system bookings of approximately \u20ac3.6 billion. The company is adding to a backlog of around \u20ac38 billion. This large backlog supports future growth predictions and gives revenue visibility.\n\nFurthermore, there is a strong demand for ASML\u2019s lithography equipment across client categories and geographical areas.\u00a0This\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in the robust order book. Semiconductor companies continue investing in sharp production processes to fulfill the boosting demand for semiconductor chips brought on by developments like AI, 5G, driverless cars, and the Internet of Things. Moreover, in Q1 2024, ASML\u2019s revenue mix comprised\u00a063% logic and 37% memory divisions. Because of its diverse consumer base, there is less reliance on any market sector.\u00a0This\u00a0lowers the risk of industry swings.\n\nFinally, ASML has maintained its projection for 2024, predicting total net sales to be comparable to 2023. This consistency shows how resilient the business is and how well it can weather changes in the market without sacrificing consistent revenue growth. To sum up, despite short-term uncertainty, ASML predicts a\u00a0better H2 in 2024.\u00a0This\u00a0is in line with the industry\u2019s ongoing recovery from the slump.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in TSM and\u00a0ASML.

Other significant purchasers include Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), Tencent Holding Ltd (OTC:TCEHY), Google, and Amazon, each reportedly acquiring 50,000 chips. Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon nearly account for 40% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue. CNBC writes.\n\nMusk\u00a0had mocked Nvidia\u2019s substantial market capitalization loss on April 19, calling the 10% stock decline \u201crookie numbers\u201d on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNvidia experienced a\u00a0significant drop in stock value, shedding $211 billion in market capitalization, marking the second-largest single-day loss in U.S. stock market history.\n\nThis steep decline\u00a0was triggered\u00a0by disappointing earnings from\u00a0ASML Holdings NV (NASDAQ:ASML) and a pessimistic market outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nMeanwhile, analysts maintained their bullish stance on Nvidia, expecting it to rule the accelerator market primarily backed by\u00a0its Blackwell product.\n\nNvidia stock gained 205% in the last 12 months. Tesla stock lost 11%.\n\nPrice Actions: TSLA\u00a0shares traded higher by 11.40% at $161.21 premarket at\u00a0the last check Wednesday.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report NVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nStory continues\n\nThis article Elon Musk's Big Bet: Tesla to Ramp Up AI Development with Nvidia's Powerful Chips originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "ASML (ASML) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned -10.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, which ASML falls in, has lost 10.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ASML is expected to post earnings of $4 per share, indicating a change of -25.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.11 points to a change of -6.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.8%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $30.62 indicates a change of +52.2% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ASML is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of ASML, the consensus sales estimate of $6.34 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -15.6%. The $29.61 billion and $40.28 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.7% and +36.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nASML reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.6%. EPS of $3.38 for the same period compares with $5.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.32%. The EPS surprise was +19.01%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nASML is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ASML. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "AMSL, AMAT, MU: Which Semiconductor Stock Is the Best Dip Buy?",
        "content": "After tech and semiconductor stocks \u2014 like ASML, AMAT, and MU \u2014 took heavy hits to the chin during last Friday\u2019s session, there\u2019s some worry that the AI stock boom as we know it is about to crumble. The AI trade may have been overdue for a cooldown or mild valuation reset, but don\u2019t expect the fundamental tailwinds to dissipate anytime soon \u2014 not while so many enterprises may be striving to one-up each other to get the most AI firepower.\n\nFor instance, software titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has not shied away from sharing its plans to back up the truck on AI hardware over the next year. According to Business Insider, Microsoft is targeting 1.8 million GPUs by December 2024. The cash-rich firm is going to be opening its wallet pretty wide to acquire that much firepower to help fuel its AI software ambitions.\n\nThus, I view Microsoft\u2019s GPU spending spree as a sign that AI-related semiconductor demand is not cooling; it may heat up further as we move into year\u2019s end, with new hardware and ambitious AI strategies (some of which entail greater AI infrastructure spending).\n\nWith that, let\u2019s use TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to check out the three aforementioned semiconductor stocks that I view as cheap and buyable on recent market weakness.\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nShares of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machinery maker ASML recently saw their multi-year stock rally end with a steep 18% plunge from their peak of just over $1,000 per share. The broader semiconductor scene, which has been quite weak of late, is partly to blame for the recent bout of weakness. However, ASML bears part of the blame for coming up short in orders in its latest (first) quarter.\n\nThough the quarter was technically a slight earnings beat, expectations for booming demand in all things semiconductor-related were too hot going into the number. Now that expectations have come down a bit, longer-term thinkers may just have a chance to capture a slightly better price of admission for a company that\u2019s still expected to post strong growth over the longer term. For this reason, I\u2019m staying bullish on the stock.\n\nASML expects revenue to be between \u20ac44 billion and \u20ac60 billion at the end of the decade, up from \u20ac30 billion to \u20ac40 billion expected in 2025. Indeed, it\u2019s the long-term game that could yield the most rewards as the AI boom, which could span many years, continues. Add the potential for booming China demand into the equation, and ASML\u2019s current revenue forecasts may prove overly conservative.\n\nAt 38.7 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), ASML stock may be on the pricy side of the historical range. Given the magnitude of longer-term AI tailwinds, however, the premium seems worth paying, especially if it gets slimmer in a continuation of the stock\u2019s sell-off.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for ASML Stock?\n\nASML stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with six unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average ASML stock price target of $1,069.40 implies 22.6% upside potential.\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\nApplied Materials is another semiconductor equipment supplier that\u2019s been dipping in recent weeks. After falling more than 10% following a year-to-date melt-up (shares of AMAT are now up 17% for 2024 so far), the semiconductor play is a standout stock to consider picking up on weakness.\n\nThe latest first quarter came in well ahead of estimates, with robust growth coming out of the Chinese region. As China-based chipmakers do their best to meet sky-high AI chip demand with new foundry buildouts and increased investment in production, Applied Materials, a firm that provides the equipment vital to building such chips, seems destined for greater growth out of China.\n\nLike other wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) firms, Applied Materials may experience a few years of steady growth rather than a sudden spike like those enjoyed by AI chip makers themselves. For investors seeking a low-cost semiconductor play, AMAT is nothing short of intriguing at 22.9 times forward P/E, well below that of ASML.\n\nOf course, the company\u2019s Chinese exposure is sure to be a source of geopolitical risks (think probes). As such, investors should evaluate the risks accordingly. Personally, I think the risks are worth the potential long-term rewards, and I\u2019m inclined to stay bullish on the stock.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for AMAT Stock?\n\nAMAT stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 19 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average AMAT stock price target of $228.24 implies 20.5% upside potential.\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU)\n\nFinally, we have Micron, a memory chip maker that stands to benefit from an increased appetite for high-performance memory requirements of leading AI systems. The stock has been sinking since April began, now down nearly 17% from its early-April all-time high. After such a parabolic spike enjoyed in March, the April plunge seems like nothing to be overly hesitant over.\n\nAt the end of the day, Micron is a dominant memory supplier with AI tailwinds that aren\u2019t going anywhere. As shares give up last month\u2019s massive gains on the back of the firm\u2019s latest quarterly blowout, I\u2019m tempted to step in. I\u2019m bullish on MU stock and will be inclined to pound to the table should it come down further over the coming weeks.\n\nMore recently, Micron announced that it\u2019s poised to get $6.1 billion in funding for new chip plants in the New York and Idaho regions, thanks to the CHIPS Act. Undoubtedly, the extra cash will go a long way as Micron looks to keep up with firms that are looking to spend heavily on all things AI.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for MU Stock?\n\nMU stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 25 Buys, one Holds, and one Sells assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average MU stock price target of $126.96 implies 16.4% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSemiconductor stocks may have been caught up in the latest AI-focused sell-off. But the long-term growth trajectory still seems intact, granting dip-buyers a potential opportunity to snag some pretty decent prices. Of the trio, analysts expect ASML stock to have the most to gain (22.6%) over the year ahead.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks were poised to follow their Wall Street peers higher after US shares rebounded from a $2 trillion selloff on optimism big tech leaders will announce hefty profits this week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial Underway Ray Dalio\u2019s Famous Trade Is Sputtering and Investors Are Bailing Stocks Climb as US Earnings Kick Into High Gear: Markets Wrap TikTok to Remove Executive Tasked With Fending Off US Claims Russians Transform Dubai as They Flee Putin\u2019s War: Photo Essay\n\nFutures showed equities in Japan and Hong Kong may rise as much as 1%, while Australian shares are set to edge higher. That\u2019s after the S&P 500 topped 5,000 \u2014 halting a six-day rout \u2014 while the Nasdaq 100 rose 1%, with Nvidia Corp. leading gains in big tech. Apple Inc. was named a top pick for 2024 at Bank of America Corp. on optimism over its upcoming results.\n\nInvestors are waiting to see if earnings will meet the lofty expectations for artificial intelligence this week when about 180 companies in the S&P 500 \u2014 representing over 40% of the gauge\u2019s market capitalization \u2014 are due to report their results. Stakes are high for the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d megacaps, whose profits are forecast to rise nearly 40% from a year ago, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The focus on earnings comes after a rout fueled by geopolitical fears and signals the Federal Reserve will be in no rush to cut rates.\n\n\u201cJust beating consensus estimates for earnings won\u2019t be enough,\u201d said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see much better guidance from Corporate America if the stock market is going to resume its advance.\u201d\n\nTreasuries wavered ahead of a flurry of bond auctions that will test investors\u2019 appetite after yields hit the highest in 2024. Investors were encouraged as some Middle East tensions eased, although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s pledge to \u201cincrease the military and diplomatic pressure\u201d on Hamas suggested an assault on the Gazan city of Rafah may be imminent.\n\nOil continued to fall in early Asian trading, mainly due to easing geopolitical tensions. Gold opened steady after tumbling 2.7% on Monday as haven demand waned.\n\nIn Asia, focus returns to China\u2019s role as a major lender to developing nations amid a report the head of the central bank wants creditors engaged in debt restructurings to agree on how to fairly share the burden of relief. In Japan, the yen is facing growing risks it will rebound against the dollar because trader positions betting it will weaken have become stretched, reaching record levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategists at Wall Street\u2019s top banks are split on whether companies can deliver on robust forecasts. While Morgan Stanley\u2019s Michael Wilson said he expects profit growth to improve as the economy strengthens, his counterpart at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Mislav Matejka, argues that hot inflation, a stronger dollar and geopolitical tensions are clouding the outlook.\n\nNearly two-thirds of 409 respondents in Bloomberg\u2019s Markets Live Pulse survey said they expect earnings to give the US equity benchmark a boost. That\u2019s the highest vote of confidence for profits since the poll began asking the question in October 2022.\n\nThe challenge to S&P 500 returns this earnings season is that companies will have to produce earnings \u2014 and outlooks \u2014 that support the already elevated multiples, according to Megan Horneman at Verdence Capital Advisors.\n\nTo Marko Kolanovic at JPMorgan, while price action may depend on earnings and could stabilize near-term, the market selloff likely has further to go.\n\n\u201cWe remain concerned about continued complacency in equity valuations, inflation staying too hot, further Fed repricing, and a profit outlook where the implied acceleration this year might end up too optimistic,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cConcerns about rising interest rates, stubborn inflation, and geopolitical risks aren\u2019t going anywhere \u2014 but this week, the tech sector may be \u2018calling the shots\u2019,\u201d said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.\n\nIndeed, the stakes are high for America\u2019s technology behemoths to start delivering on artificial intelligence promises with their earnings poised to decelerate, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists.\n\nMicrosoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. report results this week \u2014 kicking off earnings for the so-called Magnificent Seven. With AI seen as the key to future profits, its contributions to the earnings mix is a focus for traders, a BofA team including Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian said.\n\nBig tech companies are running out of steam as the earnings momentum once enjoyed by the sector faces a cool down, according to UBS Group AG\u2019s Jonathan Golub.\n\nHe cut the sector recommendation on the \u201cBig Six\u201d technology stocks \u2014 Alphabet, Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia \u2014 to neutral from overweight.\n\n\u201cEarnings momentum is turning decidedly negative following a surge in profit growth,\u201d Golub said.\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. reported continued customer losses and lagging revenue. Truist Financial Corp. posted lower first-quarter lending profits than analysts expected as it was forced to pay customers more for deposits with interest rates remaining elevated, and the bank trimmed its revenue guidance for the rest of the year. Informatica Inc. said it\u2019s not engaged in takeover talks following reports that discussions with Salesforce Inc. had cooled. Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. agreed to divest more stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers, seeking to make their planned $24.6 billion merger more appealing to antitrust authorities. Viking Holdings Ltd. and its existing shareholders are seeking to raise as much as $1.1 billion in a New York initial public offering, with the cruise operator looking to go public as the travel industry rebounds from its pandemic-era slump. ASML Holding NV is weighing options to expand its presence in the Netherlands, after the government committed \u20ac2.5 billion ($2.7 billion) to infrastructure and education spending in the region where the company\u2019s headquarters are located. Tesla Inc.\u2019s weekend move to slash prices across its range in China risks triggering a new round in the nation\u2019s bruising price war, with Li Auto Inc. immediately responding with discounts and cash rebates on new models. Reliance Industries Ltd., led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit as a continued weakness in its petrochemicals business and higher taxes offset growth in its consumer unit and a large surge in other income.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nEurozone S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, S&P Global Services PMI, Tuesday US new home sales, Tuesday Tesla, PepsiCo earnings, Tuesday BOE chief economist Huw Pill speaks, Tuesday Germany IFO business climate, Wednesday US durable goods, Wednesday IBM, Boeing, Meta Platforms earnings, Wednesday US GDP, wholesale inventories, initial jobless claims, Thursday Microsoft, Alphabet, Airbus earnings, Thursday Japan rate decision, Tokyo CPI, inflation and GDP forecasts, Friday US personal income and spending, PCE deflator, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday Exxon Mobil, Chevron earnings, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nHang Seng futures rose 1% as of 7:16 a.m. Tokyo time S&P/ASX 200 futures rose 0.2% Nikkei 225 futures rose 0.8% The S&P 500 rose 0.9%; futures were little changed The Nasdaq 100 rose 1%; futures were little changed\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.0652 The Japanese yen was little changed at 154.82 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.2503 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin was little changed at $66,566.38 Ether rose 0.3% to $3,200.08\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined one basis point to 4.61%\n\nCommodities\n\nSpot gold was little changed at at $2,328.30 an ounce West Texas Intermediate crude fell 1% to $82.01 a barrel\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets China\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires What Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed\u2019s \u2018Biggest Stumbling Block\u2019 in Taming US Inflation The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Could TSMC Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is often considered the top chipmaking play on the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market. It produces the high-end GPUs that are used to process complex AI tasks at data centers, and sales of those chips are skyrocketing as companies scramble to upgrade their AI capabilities.\n\nThat's why Nvidia's stock has soared 1,720% over the past five years. Nvidia could still have room to run as the AI market expands, but many investors are likely wondering whether other AI-related chip stocks can replicate Nvidia's jaw-dropping gains. Image source: TSMC.\n\nCould that stock be Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's biggest contract chipmaker and manufacturer of Nvidia's top-tier GPUs? Let's review its business model, exposure to the AI market, and long-term growth potential to find out.\n\nMeet the world's most important chipmaker\n\nTSMC is the world's largest and most advanced third-party chip foundry. It produces the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips for fabless chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple. The company manufactures roughly 90% of the world's most advanced chips, which makes it the top bellwether and linchpin of the global semiconductor market.\n\nTSMC's closest competitors are Samsung and Intel, but it still produces more advanced chips than either competing chip foundry. TSMC gained that lead in the process race by adopting ASML's (NASDAQ: ASML) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems -- which optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers -- before its two main rivals.\n\nHow fast is TSMC growing?\n\nTSMC's growth ebbs and flows with the cyclical semiconductor market. It experienced two cyclical downturns over the past five years -- in 2019 and 2023 -- but its market dominance and pricing power still enabled the company to expand its gross margin.\n\nMetric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue growth 3.7% 25.2% 18.5% 42.6% (4.5%) Gross margin 46% 53.1% 51.6% 59.6% 54.4% EPS growth (1.7%) 50% 15.2% 70.4% (17.5%)\n\nData source: TSMC. Taiwanese dollar terms.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, TSMC generated 46% of its revenue from the high-performance computing (HPC) market, which includes CPUs and GPUs for customers like Nvidia and AMD, and another 38% of its revenue from the smartphone market. In the HPC segment, the growth in the AI market has been offsetting sluggishness in the PC space over the past year. Unfortunately, its smartphone market is still stuck in a rut as the 5G upgrade cycle fizzles out.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor 2024, TSMC expects low to mid-20% revenue growth as the AI market expands, the PC arena stabilizes, and the smartphone market grows again in a stronger macro environment. Analysts expect both revenue and earnings to rise about 21% for the full year. Those are solid growth rates for a stock that trades at 22 times forward earnings.\n\nBut during TSMC's first-quarter conference call, CEO C.C. Wei reduced the company's growth forecast for the broader semiconductor market (excluding memory chips) from more than 10% in 2024 to \"approximately 10%.\" Wei also reined in TSMC's full-year outlook for the foundry market from approximately 20% to mid-to-high teens expansion.\n\nThose reductions, which Wei blamed on ongoing \"macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty,\" suggest another mixed year for semiconductor stocks. AI chipmakers like Nvidia would likely continue to flourish, but smartphone chipmakers like Qualcomm would probably stay in the penalty box for a few more quarters.\n\nCould TSMC become the next Nvidia?\n\nTSMC's stock has nearly tripled over the past five years, but it probably won't keep pace with Nvidia's near-term gains for two simple reasons.\n\nFirst, TSMC's business is more broadly diversified than Nvidia's. The latter's incoming orders will certainly boost TSMC's HPC revenue, but a lot of that growth will still be offset by the softness of its PC and smartphone markets. Nvidia's simpler business model will also make it the more straightforward growth play as long as the AI market keeps expanding.\n\nSecond, TSMC simply isn't expanding rapidly enough to justify a significantly higher multiple. By comparison, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to surge another 81% and 89%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 (which ends next January), but it still looks reasonably valued at 35 times forward earnings. Therefore, TSMC's stock could climb a lot higher over the next few years, but it probably won't match Nvidia's growth trajectory.\n\nTSMC and Nvidia are both great long-term plays on the semiconductor market, but it's ultimately an apples-to-oranges comparison. TSMC might be the better choice for conservative investors who are looking for balanced exposure to the chip sector, while Nvidia might be more appealing to growth investors who expect it to stay on top of the AI market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "ASML Investors Are Selling Despite Growing AI Demand. Should You Follow Suit or Buy the Dip?",
        "content": "Dutch tech giant ASML Holdings(NASDAQ: ASML) makes equipment that's crucial for the semiconductor market. And on April 17, the company reported financial results that sent the stock sliding.\n\nFor context, before the financial report, ASML stock was up roughly 50% over the past year and had even hit an all-time high. At its peak, the company was valued at over $400 billion, fueled by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI fuels semiconductor demand due to its outsize needs for computing power, memory, and more. This is why investors consider ASML a top AI stock and why it's up so much in the past year. Indeed, soon-to-retire CEO Peter Wennink told Bloomberg, regarding the rise of AI, \"I think without ASML, without our technology, that's not going to happen.\"\n\nTherefore, investors, analysts, and management all believe that AI is a big trend and believe that ASML is a crucial enabler of the trend. And that's why the market was concerned with the company's big drop in orders in the most recent quarter.\n\nWhy are investors selling ASML stock?\n\nWhen looking at ASML's net sales for the first quarter of 2024, the number was fine. The company had net sales of 5.3 billion euros ($5.6 billion), which was within management's prior guidance. But investors seem to be more focused on its bookings number.\n\nThink of it as a backlog. When ASML receives an order for one of its lithography machines, the value counts toward its bookings. When the company delivers a machine, it counts toward its net sales. Therefore, bookings can be a tangible, forward-looking metric.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, ASML had record bookings of $9.8 billion. But in the first quarter of 2024, bookings dropped way down to $3.8 billion. Granted, the company's bookings are customarily prone to wild swings such as this, but they were considerably lower than what analysts had expected.\n\nFurthermore, its bookings might have been worse in recent quarters if not for China. Various countries, including the Netherlands, are restricting semiconductor exports to China. For its part, China has responded by doubling its efforts to increase its domestic supply of semiconductors. And ASML's older machines aren't subject to restrictions, according to Reuters.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, net sales to China accounted for 49% of ASML's total net sales, which was a record. And in the fourth quarter of 2023, net sales to China accounted for 39% -- a bigger share than sales to the U.S. and South Korea combined.\n\nReading the tea leaves, it appears that China is quickly buying up ASML machines to build domestic manufacturing capacity before export restrictions get worse. That's not something that the company will benefit from indefinitely, and the sharp drop-off in bookings suggests this temporary benefit could already be fading.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould investors buy the dip?\n\nIt's going to sound like I'm talking out of both sides of my mouth. On one hand, ASML remains one of the best-positioned businesses in the world for long-term success. On the other hand, this isn't really a dip worth buying.\n\nAllow me to explain: Buying the dip implies a good deal. But in the case of ASML, it has merely dipped to where the stock traded just two months ago. Moreover, from a valuation perspective, it's hard to say that it's necessarily a bargain. After all, its current price-to-sales ratio of 12 is above its five-year average and well above the valuation it had just a few months ago. ASML PS Ratio Chart\n\nTherefore, for investors wanting a relative bargain, I'd say keep waiting with ASML stock. That said, it's likely that it will head higher over the long term, so investors need to be careful not to wait too long.\n\nThe semiconductor space was growing long before AI became a hot topic, and it's expected to keep growing regardless of how AI shakes out. And ASML's equipment is vital to the process. Because of this reality, the company's revenue has steadily grown for more than a decade, and it's been able to command spectacular net-profit margins. ASML Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe semiconductor space is notoriously cyclical, and ASML's management believes it just hit the bottom of the cycle. Therefore, it expects 2025 and 2026 to be boom years for its business.\n\nThere's good reason to believe this is true. For example, while financial results from ASML's U.S. customers have been muted in recent quarters, the U.S. is handing out incentives to increase domestic manufacturing. Companies are consequently building now and will likely be placing orders with ASML in short order.\n\nIn conclusion, ASML stock slipped due to disappointment with its bookings. The dip doesn't necessarily make it a bargain buy today, but investors who think the company's best days are in the rearview mirror are likely mistaken. The company is well positioned to profit from semiconductors for the foreseeable future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

The early response was not positive, with shares down 7.6% to \u20ac840 in the past week. Revenues \u20ac5.3b disappointed slightly, at2.0% below what the analysts had predicted. Profits were a relative bright spot, with statutory per-share earnings of \u20ac3.11 coming in 13% above what was anticipated. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on ASML Holding after the latest results.\n\nSee our latest analysis for ASML Holding  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nAfter the latest results, the 38 analysts covering ASML Holding are now predicting revenues of \u20ac27.7b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a credible 6.0% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 5.0% to \u20ac18.98. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of \u20ac27.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of \u20ac18.87 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nWith the analysts reconfirming their revenue and earnings forecasts, it's surprising to see that the price target rose 7.2% to \u20ac988. It looks as though they previously had some doubts over whether the business would live up to their expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on ASML Holding, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at \u20ac1,260 and the most bearish at \u20ac635 per share. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that ASML Holding's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 8.1% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 20% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 13% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that ASML Holding is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that ASML Holding's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for ASML Holding going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nYou should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted  2 warning signs for ASML Holding you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Pain or Gain Ahead of Semiconductor ETFs?",
        "content": "Chip stocks took a hit on Apr 17, 2024 following ASML Holding's ASML \u2013 a world leader in the manufacture of advanced technology systems for the semiconductor industry \u2013 announcement of a steep decline in bookings during the first quarter, catching investors off guard.\n\nShares of ASML \u2013 as the primary supplier of equipment for advanced chip manufacturing \u2013 slumped 7.1% in the key trading session on Apr 17, 2024. The news acted as a cornerstone for the entire semiconductor industry. Leading chip companies \u2013 AMD, Nvidia, Intel, and Qualcomm \u2013 all experienced drops in their stock prices, with Arm suffering the most significant decline of nearly 12%.\n\nThe news is crucial for the chip industry as ASML\u2019s key customers include TSMC, Samsung and Intel, the world\u2019s top processor foundries, which, in turn, make chips for AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple, per CNBC. The company\u2019s top two customers made up over half of its 2023 sales. Sales were down in Taiwan and South Korea, where TSMC and Samsung are based, respectively.\n\nSemiconductor ETFs like VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH, Invesco Semiconductors ETF PSI and iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX each lost about 3% on Apr 17.\n\nInside ASML\u2019s Downbeat Earnings\n\nDespite posting a net profit of 1.22 billion euros, surpassing expectations, ASML's net sales of 5.29 billion euros fell short of the anticipated 5.39 billion euros.The decline in net sales by 21.6% year-on-year and net income by 37.4% weighed on investors\u2019 sentiments.\n\nTotaling 3.6 billion euros in the first quarter, ASML's net bookings for machinery reflected a 4% decrease year-on-year and a significant drop from the previous quarter. This decline was attributed to weakened demand for consumer electronics, impacting chipmakers globally, including ASML.\n\nThe decline in bookings for manufacturing equipment triggered concerns about a likely downturn in the semiconductor industry. However, CEO Peter Wennink anticipates a stronger second half of 2024, attributing the current challenges to a transitional phase in the industry. Despite economic headwinds and cautious ordering from customers, ASML anticipated net sales for 2024 to be similar to the previous year.\n\nIs AI Investment Trends on Declining Momentum?\n\nIn 2023, the global investment in AI recorded a consecutive decrease, according to a report from Stanford's HAI, as quoted on TechCrunch. Both private and corporate investments in AI witnessed a slump compared to the previous year, showing signs of diminishing enthusiasm. Slower-than-expected growth, technical challenges, and a maturing investment landscape have been held responsible for this decline.\n\nStory continues\n\nValuation Concerns\n\nMost of the industry-leading chip stocks carry high valuations. This is another reason for their recent slump. For example, ASML has a P/E of 45.42X versus an industry P/E of 28.72X. Nvidia has a P/E of 67.40X versus an industry P/E of 26.53X.\n\nAny Ray of Hope?\n\nAnticipated Recovery and Future Orders\n\nAmidst the challenges, ASML expects increased orders from companies like Intel and TSMC for lithography machines later this year. ASML's optimism was further buoyed by increased production capacity among major chip manufacturers, supported by initiatives such as the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nGenerative AI: Still A Bright Spot Amid the Downturn\n\nDespite the overall slowdown in AI investment circles, generative AI \u2014 which creates new content like text, images, music, and videos \u2014 has emerged as a rising star. Funding for generative AI startups surged in 2023, indicating sustained interest in this segment. However, there are concerns about whether generative AI can deliver on its promises of efficiency gains and meaningful revenue gains.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Seeking edge over rivals, Intel first to assemble ASML's next-gen chip tool",
        "content": "By Toby Sterling\n\nAMSTERDAM, April 18 (Reuters) - Intel said on Thursday it had become the first company to assemble one of Dutch tech group ASML's new \"High NA EUV\" lithography tools, an important part of the U.S. computer chip maker's drive to outshine rivals.\n\nIntel was the first company to buy one of the 350 million euro ($373 million) machines made by top chip equipment supplier ASML. The tools are expected to lead to new generations of smaller, faster chips, though there are financial and engineering risks involved.\n\n\"We agreed to the pricing when we committed to the tools and we would not have done that if we were not confident there were cost-effective uses for it,\" Intel's director of lithography Mark Phillips said in a briefing with journalists.\n\nASML, Europe's largest tech firm, dominates the market for lithography systems, machines that use beams of light to help create the circuitry of chips.\n\nLithography is one of many technologies chipmakers use to improve chips, but it is a limiting factor in how small the features on a chip can be - smaller means faster and more energy efficient.\n\nThe High NA tools are expected to help shrink chip designs by up to two thirds, but chipmakers must weigh that benefit against a higher cost and whether older tech may be more reliable and good enough.\n\nINTEL'S MISTAKE\n\nIntel's determination to be the first to adopt High NA is not accidental.\n\nIt helped develop EUV technology - named for the \"extreme ultraviolet\" light wavelengths it uses. But it began using ASML's first EUV product later than Taiwanese rival TSMC , which CEO Pat Gelsinger has acknowledged was a big mistake.\n\nInstead, Intel focused on techniques known as \"multi-patterning\" - essentially going through more steps with lower resolution lithography machines to achieve an equivalent effect.\n\n\"That's when we got in trouble,\" Phillips said.\n\nAlthough the older DUV tools were cheaper, complex multi-patterning became too time consuming and led to too many faulty chips, slowing Intel's commercial progress.\n\nThe U.S. company has now adopted first generation EUV for the most crucial parts of its best chips, and Phillips said it expects the move to High NA EUV will be smoother.\n\n\"Now that we have EUV we're looking forward, we don't want to get in the same boat where we have to push (ASML's first generation EUV machines) too far,\" he said.\n\nPhillips said the machine at its Hillsboro, Oregon, campus would be \"fully up and running later this year\".\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel plans to use the machine, which is the size of a double decker bus, in the development of its 14A generation of chips in 2025, with early production expected in 2026 and full commercial production in 2027.\n\nASML said alongside earnings this week it had begun the process of shipping a second High NA system to an unidentified customer, likely TSMC or South Korea's Samsung.\n\nShipping and installation of the massive tools may take up to six months, giving Intel a head start.\n\n($1 = 0.9381 euros) (Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "This $362 billion\u00a0\u2018beyond well-positioned\u2019 Dutch company\u00a0is quietly winning the global AI chips race",
        "content": "High-end semiconductor manufacturing, the bedrock technology behind AI development, is a tight-knit industry. The engineering and design of advanced computer chips is dominated by American tech companies such as Nvidia and Intel. Taiwanese giant TSMC has a near-monopoly on the actual fabrication of chips developed in the U.S., building 92% of the world\u2019s advanced chips at its factories.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s ASML. Founded in the Netherlands in 1984, the lesser-known firm is dominant in a niche of its own: building and selling the high-end, extremely specialized machines TSMC and other foundries rely on to fabricate and package semiconductors. ASML might not get as much buzz as other chip companies, but it\u2019s a vital part of the semiconductor supply chain, and the $362 billion firm is poised to reap huge rewards from the AI boom.\n\n\u201cOn a high level, ASML is beyond well-positioned,\u201d Michelle Brophy, director of research for tech, media and telecom at research platform AlphaSense, told Fortune. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet against ASML.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t bumps in the road: Lower-than-expected sales numbers reported this week generated a stock selloff, and ASML is caught in the political crossfire of the semiconductor arms race between the U.S. and China. But as new chip-manufacturing facilities subsidized by the CHIPS Act go live in the U.S., ASML is poised to benefit.\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing is an incredibly technical process, relying on specialized equipment and skilled labor to design and build ever-smaller and more powerful computer chips. From the 1950s through the 1990s, it was common for chipmakers such as Intel to control every step of the process, from design to manufacturing. But as engineers began to invent smaller and more powerful chips, the business model shifted towards specialized companies focusing on a single part of the process.\n\nToday, just a few niche companies dominate the global supply chain for advanced chips. Nvidia, which focuses exclusively on design and does no manufacturing, currently designs more than 90% of chips used for AI development. TSMC, which does no design of its own and only takes manufacturing orders for its factories, has a near-monopoly on physically producing AI chips.\n\nAnd ASML has perhaps the deepest niche of them all: exclusive possession of the highly specialized equipment that TSMC uses in its factories.\n\nThe most important tool in advanced chip manufacturing is the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine. The high-end, powerful chips used for AI are manufactured by using an EUV lithography machine to etch tiny designs onto extremely thin silicon wafers, which are then stacked and combined into chips.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIf you look at a gang box\u2014where you walk into a door, you can flick one switch and turn on the fan, and one switch to turn on the light, and one switch turn on the other light\u2014behind the wall, you have copper wires. It's [the same principle as] semiconductors,\u201d President and CEO of the National Institute for Innovation and Technology Mike Russo told Fortune. \u201cWith ASML doing EUV, they've been able to get features down to one fifty-thousandth of a hair. Think of the amount of wires, instead of the copper wire on your wall, that you actually put on one layer of a chip.\u201d\n\nEUV lithography machines cost hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014and ASML is the only company on Earth that makes them. Each machine contains over 100,000 parts, and they\u2019re so large that they require three jumbo jets to ship. The cost and complexity of ASML\u2019s business has helped shield the company from competition.\n\n\u201cThe tools are so expensive,\u201d Russo said. \u201cA new EUV tool from ASML is probably $250 million. One tool.\u201d\n\nInvestors handed ASML a setback Wednesday after lower-than-expected order numbers caused a selloff that cut share prices by around 7%, even though CEO Peter Wennink assured investors the reduction in sales was temporary and the company expected stronger figures in the second half of the year. But Brophy said the retreat was likely more a factor of investors\u2019 astronomical expectations for companies in the AI space than any deeper threats to ASML\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn my view, the setup is not great for AI-related companies, just because they're primed for perfection\u2026any disappointment in the numbers was going to create a negative reaction,\u201d Brophy said. \u201cI really don't see\u2026an issue with the business longer-term.\u201d\n\nOne driver of investors\u2019 concern\u2014and a potential threat to ASML\u2019s business going forward\u2014is ASML\u2019s position in the middle of the ongoing rivalry between the U.S., Europe, and China for dominance in semiconductor production.\n\nThe Biden administration unveiled export controls in 2022 that prevent American chip designers such as Nvidia from sharing their most advanced designs with Chinese producers. American authorities have also been pressuring the Dutch government and ASML to limit sales to China and stop providing maintenance services to Chinese firms, as China seeks to develop domestic chipmaking capacity and wean itself off of dependence on Western chip designers and Taiwanese foundries. China was ASML\u2019s biggest market last year, generating about a third of its revenues.\n\n\u201cChina always opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security and making various excuses to coerce other countries into imposing a technological blockade against China,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in January.\n\nBrophy said a potential escalation between the U.S. and China in terms of semiconductor policy would affect not just ASML, but the entire chips market.\n\n\u201cOverall, does it pose a risk? It does,\u201d Brophy said. \u201cIt's not an ASML risk, it's an overall demand risk\u2026a big escalation between the two countries would affect that demand picture longer term, in my view.\u201d\n\nChina notwithstanding, ASML sees upside over the next year: CFO Roger Daasen predicted \u201crecovery for the industry in 2024 and\u2026a stronger year in 2025.\u201d Much of that optimism is driven by a slew of new American semiconductor manufacturing facilities, or fabs, being rolled out with the help of money from the CHIPS and Science Act, which could offset any revenue losses in China.\n\nIn just the past few weeks, the Commerce Department has announced over $20 billion in grants for new fabs from TSMC, Intel, and Samsung. That will likely mean a steady stream of orders for ASML\u2019s equipment, which is essential to manufacture the advanced AI chips the Biden administration is so keen on onshoring.\n\n\u201cIf one customer were to drop out, and I don't think that's the case, there would be another one lined up to take their place because there are so many projects happening right now,\u201d Brophy said. \u201cThe U.S. CHIPS Act has already awarded $12 billion dollars to [TSMC] and another $6 billion to Samsung alone, Intel is in there as well. They're all building fabs in the U.S. But let's not forget about [other] geographies, like Japan\u2014[TSMC] has already invested north of $20 billion for facilities there.\u201d\n\nASML has built a dominant position in a highly specialized niche, almost entirely shielding it from competition. Current chief business officer Cristophe Fouquet will have big shoes to fill when he takes over as CEO later this month\u2014his predecessor oversaw a 1,400% increase in the company\u2019s share price. But big picture, the outlook\u2019s good: AI\u2019s seemingly insatiable demand for advanced chips and ASML\u2019s near-insurmountable lead in the equipment space are big tailwinds that show no signs of slowing down.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

The subject of today's call is ASML's 2024 first quarter results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes and questions will take in the order that they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws.\n\nThese forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.\n\nPeter Wennink: Thank you, Skip. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 results conference call. Before we begin the Q&A session, Roger, Christophe, and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter 2024, as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our first quarter 2024 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook and I will briefly reflect on the current market environment and then hand over to Christophe to complete the introduction with some additional comments on the future business outlook. Roger?\n\nStory continues\n\nRoger Dassen: Thank you, Peter, and welcome everyone. I will first review the first quarter 2024 financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the second quarter of 2024. Let me start with our first quarter accomplishments. Total net sales came in at EUR5.3 billion at the midpoint of guidance. We shipped 12 EUV systems and recognized EUR1.8 billion revenue from 11 systems this quarter. Net sales -- net system sales of EUR4 billion, which was driven by logic at 63% with the remaining 37% coming from memory. Installed base management sales for the quarter came in at EUR1.3 billion as guided. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by product mix or immersion in UV systems and someone else.\n\nOn operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR1.32 billion and SG&A expenses came in at EUR273 million, both slightly lower than guided due to a shift in spend to later in the year. Net income in Q1 was EUR1.2 billion, representing 23.1% of total net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR3.11. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR5.4 billion, which is lower than previous quarter. We ended Q1 with negative free cash flow, primarily driven by lower down payments and higher inventory relative to last quarter. In the current environment, as customers work to return to profitability and strengthen cash position, we continue to provide some support for our customers.\n\nThe higher inventory is a result of the increased material intake, including High NA as part of planned capacity ramp in preparation for stronger demand next year. Moving to the order book, Q1 net system bookings came in at EUR3.6 billion, which is made up of EUR656 million for EUV bookings and EUR2.9 billion for non-EUV bookings. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by memory at 59% and logic for the remaining 41% of the bookings. There is quite a bit of speculation around order numbers, so I will make a few comments here. In the past six months, we've had orders of almost EUR13 billion, which is quite significant. As we said in the past, our order flow can be lumpy and may not be evenly distributed over the year. Although we don't guide orders, an order rate, a bit over EUR4 billion per quarter for the final three quarters of the year, would provide full order coverage at the end of 2024 for a 2025 sales number that would be at the midpoint of our 2022 Investor Day scenarios.\n\nAt the end of Q1 2024, we finished with a backlog of around EUR38 billion. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2024. We expect Q2 total net sales to be between EUR5.7 billion and EUR6.2 billion. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR1.4 billion. The relatively low first-half of the year, compared to the expected strong second-half is in line with the expected industry recovery from the downturn. Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 50% and 51%. The expected R&D expenses for Q2 are around EUR1.70 billion and SG&A is expected to be around EUR295 million. Our estimated 2024 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 17%. In Q1 ASML paid a quarterly interim dividend of EUR1.45 per ordinary share.\n\nRecognizing the three interim dividends of EUR1.45 per ordinary share paid in 2023 and 2024, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the annual general meeting of EUR1.75 per ordinary share, which will result in a total dividend for the year 2023 of EUR6.10 per ordinary share, which is a 5.2% increase, compared to 2022. In Q1 2024, we purchased around 0.5 million shares for a total amount of around EUR400 million. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.\n\nPeter Wennink: Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted a relatively slow Q1 as start to the year is consistent with our guidance and expectations coming out of the downturn. Overall semiconductor industry -- sorry, overall semiconductor inventory levels continue to improve, trending towards more healthy levels. We also see continued improvements in lithography tool utilization at both logic and memory customers, all in line with the industry's continued recovery from the downturn. Looking at the market segments, we see a similar environment as communicated last quarter with demand momentum from AI-related applications. Memory demand is primarily driven by DRAM technology node transitions in support of advanced memories such as DDR5 and HBM.

As many of you know, next week, April 24, is the General Meeting of shareholders and my last effective working day at ASML. Although this is not a big surprise anymore, it's still a big event for me, Martin, and our families and it has been an enormous privilege of being able to serve the company and its many stakeholders for so long. I have thoroughly enjoyed virtually every moment of it and the many interactions I've had with many of you, including these conference calls, believe it or not, and I hope I will see some of you someday, sometime and wish you all good health, a prosperous and happy life. And with that, I'd like to turn over to you, Christophe.\n\nChristophe Fouquet: Thank you, Peter. And first of all, thank you for the last 10-years leading ASML and making it the great company we know today. I think some of our audience have been with you for the 40-plus quarters you led as CEO, but probably not many for the nearly 100 quarterly calls over your past 25-years in ASML. I am sure everyone on the call will miss you as much as we all will at ASML. I am myself very honored and privileged to succeed Peter and I am very much looking forward to working with all of you. As Peter mentioned, our view on the market segment for 2024 has not changed relative to what we stated last quarter. We expect memory revenue growth this year, primarily driven by technology transition in support of advanced memory technology.\n\nWe see lower logic revenue this year relative to last year as customers digest litho capacity installed over the past year. Turning to our businesses. For EUV, we continue to expect revenue growth in 2024. We plan to recognize revenue on a similar number of EUV 0.33 NA system as 2023. In addition, we expect revenue from one to two High NA systems. On our 0.33 NA system, we shipped the first NXE:3800E this quarter for qualification at the customer. The NXE:3800E has the capability to deliver a significant increase in performance with a productivity of 220 wafers per hour, which is a 37% increase over the NXE:3600D in its final configuration. The NXE:3800E also brings imaging and overlay improvements, which will make it the future tool of choice for memory and logic advanced nodes.\n\nThose performance increases will deliver better value for our customers, including cost of ownership, and will translate into higher ASPs and improve margins for ASML. EUV customer plan to transition to the NXE:3800E this year. As a result, the majority of our low NA EUV shipments in the second-half of the year will be this system. Regarding high NA or 0.55 NA EUV, we shipped our first system to a customer and this system is currently under installation. We started to ship the second system this month and its installation is also about to start. During the SPIE Industry Conference in February, we announced first light on our high NA system located in our joint ASML-imec High NA in Veldhoven. We have since achieved first images with a new record resolution below 10 nanometer and expect to start exposing wafers in the coming weeks.\n\nAll High NA customers will use this system for early access to process development. The customer interest for our system lab is high as this system will help both our logic and memory customers prepare for High NA insertion into their roadmaps. Relative to 0.33 NA, the 0.55 NA system provide finer resolution enabling an almost 3 times increase in transistor density at a similar productivity in support of sub 2 nanometer logic and sub 10 nanometer DRAM nodes. We expect our non-EUV business to be down in 2024, primarily driven by lower emerging system sales relative to 2023. For our Installed Base business, based on our view today, we expect a similar level of revenue, compared to last year. As the recovery becomes more clear this year, customer may look to upgrade their system in preparation for 2025 and this could provide future business opportunity this year.\n\nOur outlook for the full-year is unchanged with similar revenue, compared to 2023. In line with the industry continued recovery from the downturn, we expect a stronger second-half relative to the first-half of the year. We view 2024 as a transition year and continue to make investment this year both in capacity ramp and in technology, to be ready for the upturn in the cycle. Looking longer term, while there are still significant uncertainties, primarily driven by the macroenvironment, it appears we are passing through the bottom of this specific cycle and we expect an industry recovery over the course of 2024. Based on the discussion with our customers and supporting our strong backlog, we expect 2025 to be a strong year driven by a number of factors as mentioned last quarter.\n\nFirst, the secular growth driver in semiconductor end markets, which we have previously discussed such as energy transition, electrification and AI. The expanding application space, along with increasing lithography on future technology nodes, drive demand for both advanced and material nodes. Second, the industry expects to be in the middle of a cyclical upturn in 2025. And last, as mentioned earlier, we need to prepare for the significant number of new fabs that are being built across the globe, in some instances clearly supported by several government incentive plans. These fabs are spread geographically, are strategic for our customers and are scheduled to take our tool. It is essential that we keep our focus on the future and build capacity in preparation for further long-term growth as we discussed in the market scenarios for 2025 and 2030 during our Investor Day in November 2022.\n\nWe plan to update our view during our Investor Day this year on November 14, 2024. In summary, also there is near-term uncertainty. We remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.\n\nSkip Miller: Thank you, Roger, Peter and Christophe. The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. Beforehand, I would like to ask you if you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up if necessary. This will allow us to get to as many callers as possible. Also, as the CEO transition is planned next week following the AGM on April 24, Roger and Christophe will take the majority of the questions as it pertains to the forward-looking comments. Now, operator, could we take your final instructions and then the first question please?\n\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now go to your first question. And your first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSee also\n\n15 Best Places to Retire in New Jersey and\n\n15 States with No or Low Income Tax Rates.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The share price of Nvidia has fallen.  (Igor Golovnov)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia stock fell 4% last night after a sell-off of global chip stocks and US technology firms.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite fell by over 180 points on Wednesday after the sector was hit by concerns about the Federal Reserve pushing back interest rate cuts, as well as China\u2019s weak economy.\n\nCustomers are holding off on buying as they work through stockpiles, however, China\u2019s buying of less-sophisticated machines has held up amid US restrictions on its access to high-tech equipment.\n\nIt came as ASML (ASML), the largest supplier of equipment to computer chip makers, missed sales forecasts, which sent shares lower.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Stocks rise as positive corporate results offset drop in European electric car sales\n\nTSMC (TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has revealed a better-than-projected revenue outlook amid rising demand for AI-related products.\n\nThe Taiwanese chipmaking company, whose clients include Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), stuck with plans to spend as much as $32bn (\u00a325.66bn) in 2024.\n\nTSMC has gained about $340bn of market value since an October 2022 trough, riding bets it will become a top winner of a global boom in AI development. It posted a better-than-expected rise of 9% in net income to NT$225.5bn ($7bn) for the March quarter.\n\n\u201cLooking at 2024 as a whole, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, potentially weighing on consumer sentiment and end-market demand,\u201d Wei told analysts on a conference call.\n\nLaster this month, TSMC also said it would build a third semiconductor factory in Arizona, raising its total investment in the United States to $65bn.\n\nIt already had plans to build two plants in Arizona, and another one in Germany.\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nEasyJet shares climbed more than 3% on Thursday as it narrowed its losses despite losing revenue from cancelled flights to Israel and Jordan last winter.\n\nThe budget airline took a \u00a340m hit from the Middle East conflict but still managed to trim losses for the six months to the end of March by over \u00a350m, to between \u00a3340m and \u00a3360m.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis was against losses of \u00a3411m a year earlier, and comes alongside an increase of 18% in fuel costs, adding 6% inflation per seat.\n\nIt also benefitted from the early timing of Easter this year, which led to more demand for flights during March.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price falls ahead of halving as ETF inflows slow\n\n\"The importance that consumers place on travel coupled with easyJet\u2019s trusted brand has driven good demand for our flights and holidays. Our growth and focus on productivity have reduced winter losses by more than \u00a350m,\" Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet, said.\n\n\u201cWe have further enhanced our network with the launch of new bases in Alicante and Birmingham providing greater choice for consumers across Europe.\"\n\nBetween October and March, passengers numbers rose 8% year-on-year, while average fares paid increased 9%.\n\nNokia (NOKIA.HE)\n\nNokia reported a smaller-than-expected profit on Thursday, with a double-digit fall in sales in the first quarter. This was due to a market weakened by a lack of clients investing in 5G technology.\n\nThe Finland-based firm reported a net profit of \u20ac501m (\u00a3429m, $535m) for the January to March period, up 46% from \u20ac342m the previous year. The figure was still lower than analysts had expected.\n\nOne-off gains from Nokia\u2019s licensing business contributed to the profit, it revealed.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders was \u20ac497m, up from from \u20ac332m a year earlier. However, Nokia\u2019s sales were down 20% at \u20ac4.7bn.\n\nSales at the network Infrastructure division fell 26%, measured in local currencies as well as net.\n\nThe company reiterated its outlook given in January for a comparable operating profit in 2024 of between \u20ac2.3bn and \u20ac2.9bn.\n\nIn a note to clients, JP Morgan analysts said Nokia's weak sales trends caused the earnings miss, but added the company is well positioned for a recovery.\n\nWatch: How does inflation affect interest rates?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Shares of Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) were taking it on the chin today after a disappointing earnings report from ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) led to a broad-based sell-off in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Arm was the worst performer of the group as its shares finished the day down 12%, which was even worse than ASML's 7.1% drop.\n\nArm shares get spooked\n\nArtificial intelligence stocks have soared in recent months, and Arm has been among the winners. The chip designer, known for highly efficient CPU architecture, has seen revenue growth accelerate from the breakout technology.\n\nHowever, ASML's update this morning threw cold water on the sector and led to a broad sell-off in AI stocks. As one of the most expensive in the sector, Arm got hit hard on the news. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nASML reported a sharp decline in revenue, and its guidance called for a continued decline in sales in the second quarter. While that news was roughly what Wall Street expected, both the first-quarter and revenue number and the guidance missed analyst estimates.\n\nASML expects revenue growth to improve in the second half of the year and accelerate in 2025, but the update shows that demand from chip manufacturers like TSMC may not be as strong as expected. That, in turn, could be a warning sign for Arm as the stock soared in February after it promised accelerating revenue growth due to AI-related demand.\n\nWhat's next for Arm\n\nHigh expectations are built into Arm stock, which is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio above 100 and isn't putting up the kind of eye-popping revenue growth as its collaborator Nvidia. Still, the company figures to have a bright future in AI as its CPU architecture is favored by companies like Nvidia, in part because it requires less power than alternatives.\n\nWe'll get an update from Arm next month when its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report comes out. Until then, expect continued volatility from the stock as investors weigh its valuation with the future growth in AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $535,597!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Executives at Dutch computer chip equipment maker ASML said on Wednesday they expect demand from Chinese customers to remain strong, representing \"in the ballpark\" of 20% of the company's order backlog.\n\nChief executive Peter Wennink said on a call after the company's first quarter earnings that there was currently no reason the company could not provide servicing for equipment it has sold to Chinese customers.\n\nThe U.S. and Dutch government are in talks on restricting ASML's ability to provide maintenance and servicing for advanced equipment sold to Chinese chipmakers that require an export licence under new Dutch rules introduced in the past year.\n\nThe U.S. is trying to convince allies, including the Netherlands, to make it more difficult for China to make its own advanced chips.\n\n\"There has been a discussion between the two governments ... and of course we're providing input,\" Wennink said.\n\n\"I think that is something governments need to discuss (as part of)...what they call the national security interest.\"\n\n\"There's nothing that stops us servicing the installed base in China today.\"\n\nSales to China made up a record 49% of ASML's total sales in the first quarter but in recent years China has been the company's third market following Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nCFO Roger Dassen said Chinese customers represented \"in the ballpark\" of 20% of the company's order backlog. He said chipmakers there are expanding production of \"mature\" chips -- meaning those that do not fall under any export restrictions but are still needed in products ranging from refrigerators to phones to toys to cars.\n\nDemand from \"China is strong because they're adding capacity,\" he said.\n\n\"As a result of this, China's ... global market share over the years will become larger than it is today. Their self-sufficiency will increase in comparison to today.\"\n\n\"We believe that what China is adding today in terms of mature capacity is rational and is in line with ... what the world needs in the second half of the decade,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Jane Merriman)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV\u2019s sales to China were resilient in the first quarter despite curbs on exports of high-end chipmaking equipment to the Asian nation kicking in this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Cloud Seeding Worsens Flooding Tesla Asks Investors to Approve Musk\u2019s $56 Billion Pay Again Red Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs China Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel Bankers Hit With Millions in Breakup Fees for Ditching New Jobs\n\nChina remains ASML\u2019s biggest market, representing 49% of system sales in the first quarter, the Dutch company said on Wednesday. By contrast, the proportion of sales from Taiwan more than halved, while the US accounted for 6%, down five percentage points from the prior quarter.\n\nASML, Europe\u2019s most valuable technology company, has been caught in the crosshairs of the US government\u2019s effort to stymie China\u2019s progress in the chip industry. The Biden administration pushed the Dutch government to introduce restrictions on exports of ASML\u2019s immersion DUV lithography machines, its second-most capable category of machinery, to China from Jan. 1.\n\nAs the US tries to restrict China\u2019s access to cutting-edge chipmaking tools, Beijing has been buying up kit to make more mature types of semiconductors. ASML was never permitted to sell its most advanced extreme ultraviolet machines to China, but first quarter sales indicate that demand for older lithography systems has continued.\n\n\u201cThe more you put them under pressure, the more likely it is that they will double up their efforts,\u201d ASML Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said last year in a Bloomberg interview.\n\nRead More: ASML Orders Plunge as Chipmakers Pause High-End Gear Purchases\n\nASML has forecast that as much as 15% of China sales this year will be hampered by the export control measures. Still, ASML expects \u201cstrong\u201d demand from China to continue for the rest of this year, Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen said in an investor call after the earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, the US has been pushing the Dutch government to stop ASML from servicing and repairing restricted chipmaking equipment procured by Chinese companies before the current sales ban.\n\n\u201cThat has been a discussion between the two governments,\u201d Wennink said on Wednesday during the investor call. \u201cWe are providing them with information and I think it\u2019s all being taken into consideration,\u201d he said. Currently, there\u2019s no servicing restrictions on ASML\u2019s installed base in China.\n\nStrong sales in China comes amid a backdrop of slower demand from top chipmakers outside of China, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co. as they navigate a slump in smartphone and computer sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nCountries from Germany to the US have committed tens of billions of dollars in subsidies for chipmakers to build new wafer fabrication facilities, or fabs, in an attempt to ensure domestic supplies. South Korea this year unveiled plans for a $470 billion chipmaking hub. Many of these projects, which should boost demand for ASML equipment, are not yet under construction.\n\n(Updates with quotes from ASML\u2019s analyst call)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand For Multinationals, Africa\u2019s Allure Is Fading A Very Bad Week for Tesla, Its Employees and Even Elon Musk Premiums Are Rising, and Insurers Say Lawsuits Are to Blame Amazon Expands Sales of Its Cashierless Tech, While Scaling Back Itself\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

ASML\u2019s net sales fell in the middle point of the company\u2019s guidance.\n\nNet bookings for ASML\u2019s machinery, came in at \u20ac3.6bn (\u00a33.08bn, $3.83bn) in the first quarter, down 4% year-on-year but plunging nearly two thirds versus the December quarter.\n\nThe company kept its financial forecasts unchanged, with sales seen flat from 2023's \u20ac27.6bn.

Investors and industry watchers remain focused on 2025 given the introduction of new products and the fact that 2024 remains a year of recovery for the sector.\"\n\nAsos (ASC.L)\n\nAsos shares rose 4% in London on Wednesday despite the company announcing widening losses as half-year sales plunge by nearly a fifth.\n\nThe group said underlying pre-tax losses came in at \u00a3120m for the six months to March against losses of \u00a387.4m a year ago.\n\nLike-for-like sales at the online retailer fell 18% on an adjusted basis in the first half and it confirmed it still expects sales to fall by up to 15% over the full year.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, underlying earnings in 2024-25 financial year are set to be \u201csignificantly\u201d higher than the previous two years as it reduces costs and cuts stock levels.\n\nJose Antonio Ramos Calamonte, chief executive, said this financial year was \"about taking the necessary action to get us to that path\u201d.\n\nHe added: \"When we do the right clothing at the right price, consumers fly into it,\" he said, highlighting strong sales of denim, skirts and animal prints this spring.\n\nAsos also named former Sainsbury's and Amazon executive Dave Murray as its new chief financial officer, saying that his e-commerce experience would help return the group to profitability.\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nLVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury group which owns brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, and Dior, revealed rising sales in the first three months of the year, sending shares 4.6% higher at the time of writing.\n\nResults came in broadly in line with group organic revenue, up 3% to \u20ac20.7bn (\u00a317.7bn), whilst its key fashion and leather goods division saw organic revenue growth of 2%.\n\nIt comes as investors have been previously concerned about a slump in the luxury sector as consumers grapple with high interest rates.\n\nRead more: Multiple interest rate cuts less likely this year after inflation blow\n\nSales in Asia, excluding Japan, were down 6%, however, purchases by Chinese shoppers globally grew 10, benefitting from the end of zero COVID policy in the country.\n\nLVMH, which is Europe's second-largest listed company and worth almost \u20ac400bn, is the first luxury goods maker to report quarterly sales this year amid slowdown worries.\n\nMario Ortelli, of luxury advisory firm Ortelli, said: \u201cThe market environment is challenging, especially in China, and LVMH was able to navigate it in line with expectations.\u201d\n\nJustEat (JET.L)\n\nJust Eat shares failed to deliver after it posted first-quarter orders below expectations. The stock tumbled as much as 5% on the back of the news.\n\nTotal orders came in at 214.2 million in the first-quarter, lower than the company-provided consensus of 217.1 million, as quoted by Deutsche Bank, and the 220.2 million expected by the brokerage.\n\nThis marked a slight improvement on the 7% fall in the previous three months, but was still worse than expected.\n\nIt posted a gross transaction value (GTV) of \u20ac6.55bn for the first three months of the year, matching analysts' average estimate in a company-provided consensus.\n\nIts GTV grew by 11% in key UK and Ireland markets and by 5% in Northern Europe, offsetting an 11% drop in North America and a 15% decrease in Southern Europe and Australia, the company said.\n\n\"Just Eat Takeaway continues to disappoint on orders, which becomes the name of the game in a disinflationary period,\" said Bryan Garnier analyst Clement Genelot in an e-mailed comment.\n\nThe group added that it was still exploring a partial or full sale of its struggling American unit Grubhub, while on Monday it announced its exit from New Zealand.\n\nJitse Groen, chief executive of Just Eat Takeaway.com, said: \u201cJust Eat Takeaway.com started the year well, with the acceleration of GTV growth in UK and Ireland and our continued momentum in northern Europe in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\u201cWe are excited that the investments in our business are paying off, and we are looking forward to the rest of the year.\u201d\n\nWatch: What are SPACS?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

Chipmakers there are still buying less sophisticated machines in a bid to take over the market for mature chips.\n\nSales in China were \u20ac1.9 billion in the first quarter, down from \u20ac2.2 billion in the previous period. Dutch and US export rules meant to stifle Beijing\u2019s chip ambitions have targeted the Veldhoven-based company\u2019s ability to sell cutting-edge equipment to China.\n\nASML benefited from strong demand from China last year as chipmakers there rushed to get advanced lithography machines ahead of the limits. The new measures, which fully kicked in on Jan. 1, restrict ASML from selling immersion DUV lithography machines, its second-most capable category of machinery, to China.\n\nASML has never been able to sell its EUV machines to China amid pressure from the US government. The company expects as much as 15% of China sales this year will be affected by the new export control measures.\n\nThere may be signs of optimism ahead for some of ASML\u2019s clients. TSMC flagged earlier this month that revenue in January to March grew at its fastest pace in more than a year.\n\nChristophe Fouquet, ASML\u2019s chief business officer, will take over as chief executive officer when Wennink retires later this month. He will have to balance geopolitical pressure from the US while attempting to satisfy shareholders accustomed to growth. During a decade under Wennink, shares rose nearly 1,400%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Very Bad Week for Tesla, Its Employees and Even Elon Musk For Multinationals, Africa\u2019s Allure Is Fading A Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster The Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

China Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel Powell Signals Rate-Cut Delay After Run of Inflation Surprises US Yields Spike as Hawkish Powell Puts 5% in Play: Markets Wrap\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index was broadly unchanged at the open, as a luxury stocks rally lifted by LVMH\u2019s reassuring results was offset by ASML\u2019s slump hitting tech peers. The selloff comes after the Stoxx 600 tech index\u2019s 25% surge in the past year as ASML led the sector with more than a 50% jump.\n\nFor Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote, it\u2019s \u201ca sour cocktail of factors\u201d weighing on markets. She said the rising clarity that the US Federal Reserve will delay rate cuts and mixed results from ASML have been some of the main worries playing out in the market.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointed out on Tuesday the lack of additional progress made on inflation after the rapid decline seen at the end of last year, noting it will likely take more time for officials to gain the necessary confidence that price growth is headed toward the Fed\u2019s 2% goal before lower borrowing costs.\n\nExpectations for rate cuts have been pushed back after a slew of hot US economic data in recent weeks, weighing on European stocks in April after a strong first quarter. With all eyes turning to earnings in the midst of geopolitical tensions, volatility indicators entered the area of concern for the first time since last year.\n\nGeopolitical concerns further dampened sentiment as Israel weighs its response to Iran\u2019s missile and drone attack.\n\n\u201cAn increase in risk aversion continues to build on risky assets which penalizes the stock markets, while supporting the dollar and gold prices,\u201d according to Daniel Varela, Chief Investment Officer at Piguet Galland & Cie SA. Still, with investor sentiment very low, stock markets could \u201cprogressively recover lost ground over the days ahead, if political tensions subside somewhat,\u201d added Varela.\n\nSECTORS IN FOCUS:\n\nEurope\u2019s luxury stocks could be active after industry bellwether LVMH said sales growth slowed at the start of the year, reporting a slight miss. Investors may have been bracing for a worse performance after its peer Kering warned on sales last month.

        "content": "(Recasts paragraphs 1-2, adds details on China in paragraphs 4, 9-11)\n\nBy Toby Sterling and Nathan Vifflin\n\nAMSTERDAM, April 17 (Reuters) - ASML, the largest supplier of equipment to computer chip makers, reported weaker-than-expected new bookings in its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, but had strong sales to China despite U.S.-led restrictions on what it can export.\n\nEurope's biggest tech firm kept its full-year financial forecasts unchanged, with sales in 2024 seen flat from 2023 levels of 27.6 billion euros ($29.3 billion), although it is gearing up for strong growth in 2025.\n\nNet income in the first quarter was 1.22 billion euros, down from 2.05 billion euros in the fourth quarter of 2023 but slightly better than expected, according to LSEG data. Sales were 5.29 billion euros, down from 7.24 billion euros.\n\nSales of ASML's lithography systems to customers in China made up a record 49% percent of the total in the first quarter, or around 2 billion euros, the company said in an investor presentation published alongside the earnings.\n\nNew bookings were 3.6 billion euros, well below 5.4 billion euros foreseen by analysts polled by Reuters.\n\n\"Our outlook for the full year 2024 is unchanged, with the second half of the year expected to be stronger than the first half, in line with the industry's continued recovery from the downturn,\" outgoing CEO Peter Wennink said in a statement, describing 2024 as a \"transition year.\"\n\nWennink, who is retiring, will be replaced by Frenchman Christophe Fouquet at the company's annual meeting April 24.\n\nASML dominates the market for lithography systems, machines which can cost hundreds millions of euros each that use light beams to help create microscopic circuitry.\n\nIt will benefit from new chip plants planned with support from governments in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, China and the United States.\n\nAccording to forecasts by industry group SEMI, China is adding the most chipmaking capacity in 2024, followed by Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nU.S.-led export curbs aimed at undermining China's ability to make its own advanced chips have led Chinese chipmakers to focus on building older generations of chips, using equipment that does not fall under export control policies.\n\n($1 = 0.9414 euros) ($1 = 0.9427 euros) (Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Tom Hogue, Jamie Freed and Sonali Paul)\n\nView comments",

In the fourth quarter, bookings were a record \u20ac9.19 billion.\n\n\u201cOur outlook for the full year 2024 is unchanged, with the second half of the year expected to be stronger than the first half, in line with the industry\u2019s continued recovery from the downturn,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said in the statement. \u201cWe see 2024 as a transition year.\u201d\n\nASML is the world\u2019s sole producer of equipment needed to make the most advanced chips that power everything from smartphones to sophisticated military gear. Dutch and US export rules meant to stifle Beijing\u2019s chip ambitions have targeted the Veldhoven-based company\u2019s ability to sell cutting-edge equipment to China.\n\nASML benefited from strong demand from China last year as chipmakers there rushed to get advanced lithography machines ahead of the limits. The new measures, which fully kicked in on Jan. 1, restrict ASML from selling immersion DUV lithography machines, its second-most capable category of machinery, to China.\n\nASML has never been able to sell its most advanced extreme ultraviolet machines to China amid pressure from the US government. The company expects as much as 15% of China sales this year will be affected by the new export control measures.\n\nMeanwhile, some of ASML\u2019s biggest customers have been posting positive results. Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said its quarterly revenue grew at its fastest pace in more than a year.\n\nChristophe Fouquet, ASML\u2019s chief business officer, will take over as chief executive officer when Wennink retires later this month. He will have to balance geopolitical pressure from the US while attempting to satisfy shareholders accustomed to growth. During a decade under Wennink, shares rose nearly 1,400%.\n\nASML reiterated that forecast sales this year will be similar to 2023.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStory continues\n\nA Very Bad Week for Tesla, Its Employees and Even Elon Musk A Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster The Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Strong Chip Stocks to Buy Not Named Nvidia",
        "content": "Mention potential chip stocks to invest in and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is likely the first name that springs to mind. That\u2019s for good reason: Nvidia is a dominant force in artificial intelligence and its chips are in high demand. It also seems you can\u2019t read a headline about the stock market that isn\u2019t somehow connected to the company. However, there are plenty of other strong chip stocks to buy not named Nvidia.\n\nSome of those stocks represent firms that are vital suppliers to Nvidia and other chip manufacturers. Others represent firms in direct competition. Still, others represent a mix of suppliers and competition.\n\nWhatever the case, there are many strong choices for chip stocks for investors to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most important semiconductor companies in the world, if not the most important companies overall. Its stock is the largest foundry globally and a vital link in the supply chain.\n\nMany semiconductor firms rely on a business model known as fabless manufacturing. Such firms design their hardware and chips, manufactured by foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor being the largest.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor makes roughly 90% of the world\u2019s advanced chips. It is responsible for the cutting-edge, advanced AI chips that firms, including Nvidia, make.\n\nThe company made a bullish call on chip manufacturing demand early this year, forecasting 20% revenue growth. That call immediately spiked shares by more than 10%, and they have since risen by an additional 30%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor doesn\u2019t command the impressive multiples that Nvidia does, but analysts believe it can continue growing at its present price.\n\nMicron (MU) Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a table\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) suffered more than almost any other chip stock throughout the past few years. Pandemic chip shortages hit the specialized memory chip manufacturers particularly hard. Firms over-ordered Micron chips, a supply glut caused demand for those chips to crater, and the company suffered huge operating losses in 2023.\n\nMicron generated operating losses for the first time in over a decade in 2023. Then, suddenly, the fortunes of the company changed.\n\nThe company\u2019s specialized high bandwidth memory (HBM) is in high demand. It has applications for the artificial intelligence chips that firms demand. It also began producing HBM, which will be used in Nvidia\u2019s H200 chips.\n\nThe company\u2019s HBM products remain in high demand. Most of its 2025 capacity is already booked. HBM allows artificial intelligence chips to perform better, so investors should keep their eye on MU shares. Demand is sky-high, which can still push share prices higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is among the very best positioned chip stocks available to investors today. It is, of course, the primary challenger of Nvidia\u2019s dominance. It has emerged as such a potent competitor because Its chips are nearly as powerful as those from Nvidia yet cost a fraction of the price.\n\nThus, AMD represents the best bang for your buck in the AI chip landscape. Are enterprises willing to risk investing in AMD chips over Nvidia\u2019s? Leading chip purchasers, including Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI have each announced plans to use AMD\u2019s MI300X AI platform.\n\nHowever, the answer is not that simple. AMD\u2019s newest platform boasts better specifications than Nvidia\u2019s H100 platform. Nvidia is releasing its H200 platform soon. Comparison is, therefore, muddled. Further, Nvidia has stronger software, which is particularly important in AI applications.\n\nOverall, AMD has a chance to compete with Nvidia, although it is not a clear-cut case. It\u2019s why investors should continue to bet on AMD.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is another integral link in the advanced chip manufacturing supply chain. The company monopolizes advanced lithography machines used to make the most advanced chips. Essentially, no other firm can replicate the products it produces, giving it a near monopoly.\n\nA lot has been said about those extreme ultraviolet lithography machines it produces and their importance overall. While that is integral to its story, let\u2019s look at another less covered factor.\n\nASML has been identified as one of 18 European equivalents to the U.S. Magnificent 7 stocks. UBS (NYSE:UBS) handpicked the Dutch company as one with the potential to outperform significantly. It should be a relatively easy choice for American investors, given that ASML is a tech firm. It is, therefore, very similar to the Magnificent 7, which relies heavily on technology.\n\nAI demand is going to continue to grow. That means ASML\u2019s EUV machines will continue to be in high demand as the cutting edge fabrication machines that they are.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has performed well this year, rising from $140 to $175. That strong performance is paradoxical because the company\u2019s fortunes are generally tied to phone sales.\n\nDemand for expensive handsets is lagging currently. Consumers continue to feel the pinch of inflation and are more hesitant to purchase phones that can easily cost north of $1,000. Qualcomm is a major supplier of cell phone chips, and thus, should struggle.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm is not. Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Gen 8 and Snapdragon Gen 8S chips drive the generative AI on the phone market. The company is iterating its generative AI features down throughout the price range of cell phones. Those chips were first applicable to high-end models and, in time, will bring generative AI capability to lower and lower-range models. It is easy, then, to see why QCOM stock makes so much sense at this time: People spend increasingly more time on their phones and AI opportunities therein are massive.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), like Qualcomm, is a reliable stock choice for chip stocks investors. Both firms include dividends that signal overall reliability. That isn\u2019t the primary reason for considering investing in Broadcom, but I wanted to mention it.\n\nThe bigger and more important reason is that Broadcom is an integral chip firm and part of the overall AI opportunity. The company develops infrastructure software solutions for semiconductors. Basically, Broadcom helps chip firms derive greater AI output from the same quantity of power.\n\nThe company is also thriving fundamentally. During the most recent quarter, revenues increased by 34%, reaching $11.96 billion. The company repurchased 7.7 million shares of stock and eliminated them. Broadcom is also known to hike its dividends annually.\n\nAVGO Stock is an excellent choice for more conservative investors looking to exploit the AI boom. While Broadcom doesn\u2019t benefit from outsized valuation multiples like Nvidia, its impressive growth is very attractive.\n\nSkyworks (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a chip supplier that derives a significant portion of its sales from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIt is similar to Qualcomm, an integral chip supplier to the iPhone maker. Like Qualcomm, Skyworks stock currently includes a dividend yielding 2.6%.\n\nThe application of generative AI to handsets is still nascent. That\u2019s arguably the best reason to consider Skyworks at the moment. It derives a significant portion of its sales from cell phones. As that market grows, so should company-wide opportunities. Skyworks is positioned to grow with that emerging market.\n\nInvestors should also note that there are potential pitfalls despite Skyworks\u2019 overall strength.\u00a0 Apple continually makes efforts to bring chip production in-house. Qualcomm has served as an excellent example of that truth.\u00a0 The risk that Apple walks away is one that the company continually has to navigate.\n\nYet, Qualcomm has proven that it is difficult for Apple to do so. Thus, the overall opportunity for Skyworks seems to be strong.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $1,000 and Hold for Forever",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is sure to produce some very big winners, but it also has the potential to disrupt large incumbents. How to be sure you're investing in one of the AI beneficiaries, and not the disrupted?\n\nThe question is not an easy one. But an assessment of a company's competitive advantages and history defending those competitive advantages may yield clues.\n\nSifting through today's tech landscape, these three companies look like excellent sleep-at-night additions for your AI-focused portfolio.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWill Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) be helped or hurt by AI? It certainly appears to be the former, as the company has extremely wide moats across its empire and many ways to win from AI.\n\nObviously, Microsoft has an exclusivity arrangement with OpenAI, the parent company behind ChatGPT. Microsoft has parlayed that savvy partnership into a leadership position in the AI cloud computing races, yielding best-in-class growth for its Azure cloud platform compared with its rivals. As one of only three major cloud infrastructure players, where most AI processing is likely to take place, Microsoft looks poised to benefit from AI's increased computing intensity for years to come.\n\nBut Microsoft's AI advantage goes beyond OpenAI. As a longtime leader in enterprise software, Microsoft has deep relationships with the world's largest businesses going back decades. With a highly regarded brand and with the capital strength to invest in the latest innovation, it's a pretty safe bet Microsoft will be able to use AI to both increase revenues and lower costs over the long-term.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft just rolled out AI CoPilot for Microsoft 365 at a cost of $30 per person per month. That's a big price increase, made possible by the wide moat the Microsoft 365 Office software suite enjoys among corporations.\n\nBut even beyond Azure and Office, Microsoft's other business segments, each with their own wide moat franchises and network effects, all stand to benefit from AI. The LinkedIn social media platform stands to benefit from advanced AI targeting, and Github users should also benefit from AI natural language prompts for code-writing.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd let's not discount the effect AI can have on Microsoft's consumer businesses. Microsoft owns the Xbox gaming platform, along with a host of game studios such as the recently purchased Activision-Blizzard, where AI can perhaps aid in content creation and curation. Moreover, as AI moves to the edge, AI PCs could enable Microsoft to raise prices on its Surface line of laptops.\n\nWith several competitively advantaged products and services and leading AI capabilities, Microsoft should be a big AI winner.\n\nASML Holdings\n\nWhat's a good sleep-at-night stock? A company with a monopoly. And that's just what ASML Holdings(NASDAQ: ASML) has, specifically in the technology needed to produce the world's most leading-edge chips: extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV).\n\nAll AI chips worth their salt require EUV lithography order to pack an incredible number of tiny transistors onto a die. Soon, the AI wars will require ASML's \"high-NA\" EUV technology, ASML's latest incarnation of EUV, in order to compete.\n\nThe new high NA system will shrink a chip's critical dimension, or the smallest feature that can be printed on a wafer, down to 8nm, from the 13nm enabled by regular EUV systems. That's a 1.7 times improvement, which will enable new 2nm chips coming in 2025.\n\nThat's why the new high-NA systems cost some $380 million a pop, more than double the cost of the standard EUV systems ASML has sold up until this point. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThat paves the way for rapid revenue growth starting soon, which should continue through this decade. Of note, the first company to buy a high-NA system wasn't Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's leading fab company today, but rather Intel. That's because Intel is trying to catch up to TSMC and become one of the world's major foundries. Samsung will likely also follow, as will memory chipmakers, who will all use high-NA at some point this decade to produce the DRAM memory chips also crucial to AI systems.\n\nThe competition among TSMC, Intel, and Samsung, as well as governments worldwide investing in leading-edge chips produced on their own shores assures robust demand for ASML's machines this decade.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nArtificial intelligence will likely cement the advantages of companies with huge numbers of users and amounts of proprietary data. Not only does Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) have that in spades with its core Facebook and Instagram platforms, but Meta is also becoming a big player in building AI models itself.\n\nIn its core business, AI can help show Reels in which users are more likely to be interested. And for monetization, AI helps create and optimize ads, increasing returns on ad spend for advertisers and therefore increasing the price Meta can charge per ad.\n\nMeta is also building large language AI models itself under the Llama brand name. Interestingly, Meta has decided to make Llama open-source, essentially giving the code away to developers. That's a curious strategy and differentiated from competitors, but it could be effective. The contributions of third parties can potentially improve Llama relative to what Meta could do alone, and the open nature of the model could attract top talent.\n\nMuch like Facebook didn't make any revenue at first as it scaled, Llama doesn't make a lot of money now, although other cloud platforms do pay Meta a fee to host the Llama model in their clouds. However, if Llama is used as a baseline model for many future applications, there is more potential for monetization there.\n\nMeanwhile, like all other big tech companies, Meta just introduced its own AI chips called Artemis. Meta claims running workloads on Artemis with it own optimized software will help reduce costs and save energy, although it will still be buying lots of Nvidia chips. too.\n\nMeta has also overcome many challenges in the past. These include the transition to mobile, the threat of Snap, then the even bigger challenge from Bytedance's TikTok. But Meta has managed to use its incumbent position and technological agility to fend off these tech challengers and thrive.\n\nCombined with a brand new dividend, Meta is another stock investors can feel comfortable buying and holding for the long term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has turned out to be an incredible catalyst for many companies over the past year or so, and many names that are capitalizing on the growing adoption of this technology have witnessed a rapid rise in their share prices.\n\nFor instance, an investment of $10,000 in Nvidia at the beginning of 2023 is now worth almost $58,000. That's not surprising as this company has been a pioneer in the field of AI thanks to its graphics cards, which allow users to train large language models (LLMs) and deploy AI applications. A similar investment in Super Micro Computer stock at the beginning of last year is now worth $110,000 as the company's AI servers have been in hot demand.\n\nThe good part is that AI adoption is still in its early phases. Buying solid AI stocks as a part of a diversified portfolio could allow investors to profit from this secular growth trend.\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) and ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) are two such stocks that investors can consider buying right now to make the most of the proliferation of AI.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies is turning out to be a solid play on the booming demand for AI software. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is witnessing robust adoption, and management said\u00a0it's helping the company \"significantly compress sales cycles and accelerate the rate of new customer acquisition.\" That's not surprising as AIP gives organizations the ability to integrate large language models into their operations through bootcamps, which Palantir hosts to help clients understand the use cases of AI and how this technology can be used to make their businesses better.\n\nAIP has led to a sharp jump in the number of commercial deals the company has been signing. Management pointed out on the February earnings call, \"The demand is off the charts for AIP, with boot camps as the delivery mechanism for AIP, and we're seeing AIP drive the expanding addressable market.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strength of Palantir in the AI software market is a key reason why analysts expect the company's revenue to increase 22% in 2024 to $2.71 billion -- an improvement from the 17% growth reported for 2023. More importantly, Palantir's AI business is in the early phases of growth as the market for AI software platforms is expected to clock annual growth of 31% through 2030, generating revenue of $279 billion by the end of this decade.\n\nPalantir's growth rate is likely to accelerate if it manages to maintain its impressive deal momentum. For instance, the number of $1 million-plus deals it struck in the fourth quarter of 2023 nearly doubled on a year-over-year basis to 103.\n\nThe company's remaining performance obligations (RPO), the value of future contracts Palantir expects to fulfill in the future, also jumped 28% year over year to $1.24 billion. With RPO growth outpacing the top line, the company is well-positioned with a healthy revenue pipeline.\n\nAnd now, the company has partnered with Oracle to distribute its AI software platform across a wider network, which should help it land more customers. These promising developments explain why analysts are forecasting 85% annual earnings growth for the company over the next five years.\n\nThis improved earnings power is likely to fuel even more gains for Palantir shareholders, making it a top choice for investors looking to add an AI growth stock to their portfolio.\n\n2. ASML Holding\n\nSemiconductors are playing a critical role in driving the AI revolution, which is evident from the huge demand for Nvidia's chips. However, manufacturing those chips wouldn't have been possible without machines from ASML Holding.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's flagship H100 processor, which sells like hotcakes, is manufactured using a custom 5-nanometer (nm) node from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC. For manufacturing chips based on this process node, TSMC utilizes ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems.\n\nThe good news for ASML is the demand for advanced process nodes is increasing thanks to AI. Nvidia, for instance, is rapidly increasing the output of its AI chips to meet customer demand. To make that happen, foundries such as TSMC are reportedly boosting their capital investments. On its previous earnings call, TSMC management pointed out that \"between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for the advanced process technologies\" out of its total capital expenditure budget of $28 billion to $32 billion for 2024.\n\nMoreover, with the likes of Nvidia and Apple set to move to more advanced chips manufactured using 3nm and 2nm process nodes, the capital expenditure on procuring EUV machines should ideally increase. This is the reason why the orders for ASML's machines shot up significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Dutch company saw its net bookings spike to 9.2 billion euros in Q4 2023 from 2.6 billion euros in the preceding quarter. Its order backlog stood at a solid 39 billion euros. ASML's order book is likely to become larger as the market for AI chips is expected to grow at an annual rate of 38% through 2032, further driving the demand for advanced chipmaking equipment.\n\nTSMC, for instance, is set to build a third plant in the U.S. to manufacture 2nm chips, which also means it will be placing orders for ASML's EUV lithography equipment as the latter holds a monopoly-like position in this market. In all, the secular growth of the AI chip market and ASML's hold over EUV lithography are the reasons why this company seems set for robust growth going forward.\n\nIt's worth noting shares of the company have jumped nearly tenfold in the past decade, and the lucrative semiconductor opportunity that lies ahead signals that ASML stock could turn out to be a major winner in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

These are three of the top players in the sector that I don\u2019t think get enough love. Accordingly, those looking for a more diversified chips portfolio should look at the stocks investors are looking at now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst off the list is the Asian semiconductor company Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). The company\u2019s Q1 earnings were recently released, and these numbers impressed investors with Taiwan Semi\u2019s excellent results.\n\nTSMC stock surged as the company reported 16.5% sales growth on a year-over-year basis. The company\u2019s March-quarter sales hit $18.86 billion, easily surpassing estimates of $18.26 billion. Previous-year sales were $16.62 billion, signaling strong growth over time. TSMC\u2019s Q1 revenue rebounded after four quarters of decline. Clients include some of the most prominent names in this space, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAnalyst Charles Shi maintained a buy rating for TSM stock, raising his price target to $168 from R133. He cited TSMC\u2019s strength in AI and said that despite the impact of an earthquake, the company expects to meet its full-year growth target. Shi predicts a Q3 recovery, and I\u2019m in line with this view.\n\nThe company also holds 50% of the contract chip manufacturing market to add to this thesis.\u00a0 It dominates the highest-performing computing sector. Alongside AMD, Nvidia and Broadcom, TSMC also shares the success of AI chips as these companies rely on TSMC. With cutting-edge chip tech like 3nm and upcoming 2nm processes, TSMC drives AI innovation. Bullish forecasts predict over 20% revenue growth in FY24. Expanding with new plants in Germany and Japan, TSMC leads the AI revolution.\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nPredicted to have an upward trajectory until 2027, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is a semiconductor stock every investor should have in their portfolio right now. Analysts predict a 25% rise to $1,215 per share by 2025. Progression suggests $1,500 in 2026 and nearly $1,900 by 2027, doubling the current value. ASML\u2019s dominance in chip technology, especially EUV lithograph, which is crucial for AI, supports this potential growth.\n\nBased in the Netherlands, the company revolutionizes semiconductor production for Intel and TSMC using EUV light, creating ultra-thin lines on silicon. Its lithography dominance, shielded by patents, faces challenges from espionage and trade disputes.\n\nASML\u2019s future shines bright, particularly in lithography. Mordor Intelligence forecasts over 11% annual growth for EUV lithography through 2029. Demand for high-performance chips, essential for AI, fuels ASML\u2019s prospects, with Taiwan Semiconductor as a critical client. Moreover, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst\u2019s note highlights favorable risk/reward in ASML, driven by AI momentum.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecently upgraded by analysts, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) excels in semiconductor and display equipment, favored by JPMorgan(NYSE:JPM) with a $260 price target. Strategic positioning and tech advancements, like HBM and GAA, position the company well for market share growth in a projected $110 billion market by 2025. Q1 results surpassed forecasts, underlining its market strength and strategic accuracy.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald also upgraded Applied Materials to overweight, raising their price target to $260 per share. Expectations of a strong semiconductor equipment market drove this shift. Applied Materials\u2019 strategic position and tech advancements, including HBM and GAA transistors, fuel optimism for market share growth.\n\nApplied Materials\u2019 GAAP earnings were $2.41 per share, exceeding the non-GAAP $2.13. Despite a slight sales decline from Q1 2023, improved gross and operating margins led to a 19% year-over-year profit increase. Services segment profitability, notably, rose significantly, aiding overall profitability.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "ASML Holding N.V.'s (AMS:ASML) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?",
        "content": "ASML Holding's (AMS:ASML) stock is up by a considerable 40% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on ASML Holding's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for ASML Holding\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ASML Holding is:\n\n58% = \u20ac7.8b \u00f7 \u20ac13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every \u20ac1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn \u20ac0.58 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nASML Holding's Earnings Growth And 58% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that ASML Holding has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 26% net income growth seen by ASML Holding over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nAs a next step, we compared ASML Holding's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 31% in the same period.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about ASML Holding's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs ASML Holding Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nASML Holding has a three-year median payout ratio of 34% (where it is retaining 66% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and ASML Holding is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.\n\nBesides, ASML Holding has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 29%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that ASML Holding's future ROE will be 56% which is again, similar to the current ROE.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that ASML Holding's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "title": "7 Mega-Cap Stocks Poised to Double Your Money in 3 Years",
        "content": "Mega-cap stocks are solid investments overall for several reasons. Recently, they\u2019ve been responsible for the lion\u2019s share of increases in the S&P 500. An investor who focused solely on mega-cap stocks would have outperformed the stock market overall during that period. So, \u00a0a high potential for strong returns is one of the best reasons to consider investing in mega-cap companies.\n\nThe other primary benefit of investing in mega-cap stocks is that they are generally safe. Most of these companies are also blue chip stocks, meaning that they are household names. They tend to have long track records of impressive performance that suggest continued stability. On top of that, they often provide income in the form of dividends. It all suggests stability.\n\nThose are two excellent reasons to consider investing. Let\u2019s look at seven mega-cap stocks that have the potential to double your money within three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a key challenger in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) chip dominance. Generally speaking, that is the reason investors are so interested in the stock currently. Most investors are simply reacting to the general strong sentiment surrounding the firm to rationalize their investment. Dig a little bit deeper, and it\u2019s easy to understand why AMD is indeed a strong investment but also one that can triple within the next few years.\n\nThe logic for believing that statement can be found in comments made by CEO Lisa Su. Late last year Sue predicted that the market for AI data center chips could reach $400 billion by 2027. Analysts from New Street research noted that even if data center spending only reaches half that target in that time frame, it would correlate to a potential quadrupling of AMD\u2019s price, which was roughly $130 at that time.\n\nThat would put its price in the low $500s, which is roughly triple its current price.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe arithmetic that governs a potential doubling in ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock by 2027 is fairly straightforward. Let\u2019s start by running through that quickly.\n\nAnalysts currently believe that ASML shares could rise approximately 25% in the next year. That Would bring prices to $1,215 in 2025. Let\u2019s imagine that things continue to go well and progress at the same pace for the next two years. That would bring prices just above $1,500 in 2026\u00a0 and near $1,900 by 2027. That equates to a doubling from its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s also perfectly logical to believe that that is possible, given the strength of ASML\u2019s products and their relation to current trends. It\u2019s then one of those mega-cap stocks to consider.\n\nASML is the leading chip tool maker at the leading edge of the technology. the company enjoys a monopoly over extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). That technology is used to etch patterns on the most complex chip wafers and is indispensable in relation to artificial intelligence. If the AI trend continues as it has, it\u2019s entirely likely that ASML doubles in that timeframe.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe\u2019s (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock, like that of so many other companies on this list,\u00a0 is rising and falling on the potential of artificial intelligence. The emergence of artificial intelligence is the reason to believe Adobe could double from here.\n\nNow is arguably an excellent time to stake a position in the stock. Adobe is well known for Photoshop and other graphics tools that position the firm well in the generative AI race. That\u2019s the primary reason that the stock did so well last year. However, Adobe was unable to monetize it to the level investors had expected.\n\nThe result is that Shares currently trade for $485. That follows a strong pullback that began in February. I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s an overreaction to the overreaction that created the hype in the first place. Adobe did not end up buying Figma which many believed was a bad deal to begin with. That\u2019s positive news. Adobe just has to figure out how to better monetize Firefly. There\u2019s a huge opportunity, given the demand for AI products in content creation. Adobe can easily double from its current price point by 2027. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks for investors to consider.\n\nTesla (TSLA) The Tesla, Inc, TSLA, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen on a screen, viewing the stock price for the electric vehicle and technology company.\n\nSource: The Bold Bureau / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors are looking for reasons to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0 stock at the moment. there\u2019s a clear contrarian opportunity for those who can find optimism among all the negativity. Shares currently trade for $170. So, it\u2019s easy to see why they have the potential to double in the next few years, given that they traded above $400 just before quantitative tightening set in.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled, there is plenty of reason for negativity at the moment. Tesla just released its Q1 delivery figures which were disappointing. Elon Musk\u2019s company delivered 386,810 vehicles during the first quarter representing an 8.6% decline year over year. It was the first time since the pandemic began that deliveries fell. Those delivery figures were also far below numbers analysts had been expecting.\n\nBeyond that, competition is heating up in the EV sector. Tesla won\u2019t benefit as strongly from its early competitive advantages moving into the future.\n\nHowever, it isn\u2019t all doom and gloom in the near term. Shipping disruptions in the Red Sea were partially to blame for the lower-than-expected delivery numbers. Furthermore, at some point, the Chinese economy will turn around, and demand will rebound. That should propel Tesla higher in the coming year or so.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite its strong growth, it\u2019s unlikely to surprise many that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has the potential to double from here.\n\nLet\u2019s assume two things; one, Nvidia continues to enjoy a dominant position in relation to AI for the next few years, two, strong metrics continue to hold over that period. Under that scenario Nvidia can double by 2027.\n\nNvidia\u2019s sales are expected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $102 billion dollars in 2025, per consensus estimates. Some Wall Street analysts believe that revenues could reach $300 billion by 2027 on AI chip sales alone. Nvidia shares would easily double under that scenario and, more realistically, would triple in value, assuming valuations hold steady. Growing from $102 billion in sales in 2025 to $300 billion by 2027 makes that potential very obvious.\n\nMore likely, though, metrics like the P/E ratio would rise even higher if Nvidia sales grow that quickly. Thus, share prices would more than triple if sales grow to that height by 2027.\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nCould Toyota (NYSE:TM) stock eventually emerge as the biggest winner in the EV revolution?\u00a0 The answer is a resounding: \u201cYes!\u201d\n\nToyota has been building ultra-reliable, somewhat uninspiring vehicles for many decades. The company\u2019s nature is to default to data suggestive of reliability in guiding its decision processes. It\u2019s highly likely that Toyota knew that a pure EV strategy was not the way forward based on such data.\n\nThat got Toyota in trouble relative to other big automobile manufacturers that adopted the EV craze to their detriment. Just look at what has happened to Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM). Their decision to invest heavily in pure EV technology hasn\u2019t paid off. Toyota believes that a hybrid first strategy is The logical path toward EV profits.\n\nAs the EV hype has died down, Toyota suddenly looks brilliant. The point here is not for Toyota to say I told you so but rather that the company\u2019s slower, iterative approach will win in the end. That\u2019s why I believe the company will ultimately emerge as one of the big winners in the EV race over time. Toyota is likely to find profitability from EVs without sinking unnecessary billions of dollars into the technology in an effort to skip the necessary steps.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that many investors are betting on Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) stock to double in the next few years. Share prices have fallen by more than 75% since late 2020. During that period, Alibaba has gone from a presumed competitor with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to something much less flattering.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s very easy to find a narrative in which Alibaba doubles in the next few years. Let\u2019s do some simple arithmetic that proves the possibility is entirely real. Alibaba\u2019s price/sales ratio over the last 10 years has a median of 8.34. However, it currently stands at 1.43.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely that it\u2019ll rise to the median anytime soon: the Chinese economy continues to experience difficulty. Alibaba\u2019s shares are unlikely to pop for that reason. However, imagine that the P/S ratio doubles. That would correlate to a doubling of price and more, given that sales are predicted to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. If the Chinese economy rebounds over the next few years, it\u2019s all entirely possible. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Shareholder Meetings in Focus as Earnings Season Begins",
        "content": "Companies have faced a range of challenges over the past two-plus years. Following the 2021 boom driven by intense fiscal and monetary stimulus, along with the subsequent dramatic rise in interest rates throughout 2022, last year was tough at the macro level as corporate profit growth stalled. But the fourth-quarter reporting season underscored just how strong large multinational companies are in producing cash flow and rewarding shareholders.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with STLA.\n\nAccording to Factset, a third-straight quarter of earnings per share growth is the current forecast among S&P 500 companies.[1] We'll know a whole lot more beginning this Friday when the big banks begin posting first-quarter results. Investors will also be curious about dividend and buyback plans now that the earnings recession is clearly in the rearview mirror. Furthermore, capital markets may be turning the corner with a few decent IPOs in recent weeks and M&A activity showing vital signs in some industries.\n\nWhy shareholder meetings matter\n\nClues on all these areas are commonly provided at shareholder meetings. At annual events, stockholders vote on important company decisions such as electing board members (we saw the drama on that front last week with Disney (NYSE:DIS)), approving M&A actions and other corporate moves.\n\nShareholder meetings offer a platform for management teams to hear from equity owners big and small while relaying operations plans to the market. The gatherings can become tense, though, when activist investors assert themselves. Enhanced stock price volatility can also come about when major strategy shifts are announced unexpectedly or if surprising financial details are presented.\n\nGather round\n\nThe April through June stretch is the peak season for shareholder meetings. Let's shed light on some of the most notable events that could move individual stocks and drive industry price action. There's even a sweet treat at the end.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobal Shareholder Meetings by Month (2022-2024) Shareholder Meetings in Focus as Earnings Season Begins\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nApril 16: Stellantis (NYSE:STLA)\n\nThe auto OEM space is in flux. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported very weak March EV numbers and a tepid outlook while Ford (NYSE:F) posted solid year-on-year hybrid sales.[2] Investors may get a glimpse of how the situation has unfolded at Stellantis after a tumultuous second half of 2023 recall last year's labor strikes and an eventual agreement reached between workers and management. Then in March, Stellantis reported that it will cut 400 tech jobs, so all may not be so well with the U.S. automaker.[3] Looking ahead, rival Ford's shareholder meeting is slated for May 9.\n\nApril 22: Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nPowering markets higher last year and during the early part of 2023 was the semiconductor area. Broadcom is seen as the little sibling of sorts to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), but the former's 100%-plus return over the past 12 months is no sleeper among momentum traders. The AI infrastructure buildout player's shareholder meeting could provide further details about the chip industry's growth trajectory. The company's second-quarter earnings release doesn't come until June 12.\n\nApril 24: ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nKeeping on the semiconductor theme, the third-largest non-U.S. stock hosts its shareholder meeting just two days after Broadcom's.[4] The Dutch company, part of Goldman's vaunted GRANOLAS trade, is also a beneficiary of the AI boom.[5] Strong EPS growth is expected this year, but shares trade at a lofty forward earnings multiple.[6] Any financial updates presented could move the stock as well as European equity ETFs.\n\nApril 24: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)\n\nBroadening out, Bank of America's shareholder event comes just eight days after the release of its first-quarter profit report. CEO Brian Moynihan has navigated volatile financial and capital markets okay, but the bank's one-year stock performance pales in comparison to peer JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM). Be on the lookout for comments about consumer spending and risk appetite among institutions at the event. Money Center banks would benefit from more active capital markets as the year unfolds, so say analysts at Morgan Stanley, but much uncertainty remains.[7]\n\nApril 30: Citigroup (NYSE:C)\n\nCiti's shareholder gathering takes place the following Tuesday after its April 12 first-quarter report. CEO Jane Fraser has been leading a turnaround at the $120 billion market cap bank, and the stock has responded well up 20% year to date. Last month, the industry reported improved credit card delinquencies and a decline in net charge-offs.[8] It comes as card issuers are seen being negatively impacted by a new swipe-fee agreement, potentially having a material impact on revenue.[9]\n\nMay 1: The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nSpeaking of the consumer, volatility could come about on April 30 when Coca-Cola reports first-quarter results. Its annual shareholder meeting occurs the next day on Wednesday, May 1. The stock is down fractionally in the past 12 months, no doubt hurt by the rising popularity of GLP-1 wonder drugs. But Coca-Cola hiked its dividend by more than 5% earlier this year, perhaps a sign that the Consumer Staples stalwart remains a dominant brand around the world.[10] Growth in its Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and EMEA regions helped drive a 7% year-on-year revenue jump, as reported back in February.[11]\n\nMay 4: Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(BRK.B)\n\nThe most famous shareholder meeting is arguably the one hosted by the Oracle of Omaha. Woodstock for Capitalists will have a somber tone on the first Saturday in May, however. The event comes after the passing of Charlie Munger, the late vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Still, value investors will look forward to hearing what Buffett has to say about the state of the economy and what Berkshire plans to do with its growing cash position. First-quarter 2024 earnings are also released at the annual event.\n\nMay 6: The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY)\n\nLast but not least, this year's shareholder meeting in Hershey, Pennsylvania might capture more attention following the meteoric rise in cocoa futures in the past three months.

        "title": "Should You Buy ASML Holding Stock Before April 17?",
        "content": "Semiconductor equipment giant ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) has stitched together impressive gains on the stock market so far this year, appreciating by nearly 28% as of this writing, and the company's fourth-quarter 2023 results played a key role in driving that surge.\n\nASML released its Q4 results on Jan. 24. Investors liked what they saw, and the stock hit a new high. The Dutch semiconductor bellwether has maintained its momentum since then, but its rally will be put to the test when it releases its first-quarter 2024 results on April 17. Will ASML be able to deliver another strong set of results and guidance later this month?\n\nWhy ASML could deliver a positive surprise\n\nASML ended 2023 with a total revenue of 27.6 billion euros, an increase of 30% from the previous year. However, the company offered conservative guidance for 2024, saying it expects its revenue to be identical to 2023.\n\nManagement pointed out in the fourth-quarter earnings release that the semiconductor industry is currently working through a bottom, and said demand for its lithography equipment is showing signs of improvement. Still, management adopted a cautious approach, forecasting that Q1 revenue would land between 5 billion euros and 5.5 billion euros.\n\nThat would be a 22% decline from the prior-year period's 6.75 billion euros. Additionally, ASML's gross margin guidance range of 48% to 49% for Q1 would be a contraction from the 50.6% gross margin it delivered in the same period last year.\n\nIn short, ASML has predicted that its top and bottom lines will contract significantly in Q1.\n\nHowever, there is a good chance that the company may surprise Wall Street with better numbers. After all, the guidance for its full-year revenue to be flat suggests that it expects a nice jump in revenue in subsequent quarters as customers start purchasing more of its semiconductor manufacturing equipment. And it won't be surprising if we hear that the turnaround actually began in the first quarter, for a few simple reasons.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML saw a significant surge in orders in Q4. The company received bookings worth almost 9.2 billion euros, which was more than three times the 2.6 billion euros in bookings it received in Q3. This sharp surge can be attributed to the booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nThis is evident from the fact that 5.6 billion euros worth of ASML's orders last quarter were for its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These EUV lithography machines are used for making advanced chips using process nodes that are 7-nanometer or smaller in size. Foundries, chipmakers, and cloud computing companies are aggressively looking to boost their AI chip production capacities to meet demand.\n\nFoundry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, for instance, could increase its 2024 capital expenditure budget by more than 7% to a range of $30 billion to $34 billion from the earlier forecast of $28 billion to $32 billion, according to Taiwan-based newspaper Commercial Times. Meanwhile, Samsung plans to increase its production of high-bandwidth memory chips by 2.5 times in 2024 to satisfy AI-driven demand.\n\nAll this explains why sales of wafer fabrication equipment are expected to return to growth in 2024 with a projected gain of 3% following their 3.7% decline in 2023. Even better, equipment spending is forecast to jump by 18% in 2025. As foundries and chipmakers start opening their wallets for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, ASML should ideally be able to convert more of its 39 billion euros worth of backlog into revenue.\n\nIf that happens, there is a good chance that its revenue, earnings, and guidance could turn out to be better than what Wall Street is forecasting, and that could help the stock sustain its impressive rally.\n\nBut should you buy the stock before earnings?\n\nASML stock's rally in 2024 has brought its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 46. That's higher than its five-year average P/E ratio of 41. Meanwhile, its forward earnings multiple of 50 suggests that analysts on average are expecting a contraction in its earnings for the full year to $20.38 per share. But we have already seen that ASML is capable of springing surprises on the market, and the good part is that analysts are forecasting a sharp acceleration in its bottom-line growth starting in 2025. ASML EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSo, ASML seems to be on solid ground as far as its near-term and longer-term prospects are concerned, and the stock seems capable of heading higher after the company delivers its Q1 results on April 17. That's why investors who are looking to buy semiconductor stocks to capitalize on the AI boom could consider buying ASML before that report arrives.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Analysis-Dutch set to comply with U.S. demands on China exports",
        "content": "By Toby Sterling\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - U.S. demands that chipmaking giant ASML stop servicing some equipment it has sold to Chinese customers are a diplomatic and business headache for the Dutch government, but signs are it will continue to align with Washington on export restrictions.\n\nAlthough Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government is reluctant to make a blanket decision, its public statements and national security interests suggest it will be slow to approve Chinese maintenance requests in future and quick to deny them.\n\nThat would be a setback for China's attempts to build up its domestic chip industry, because ASML gear is almost impossible to replace and will break down over time if not maintained.\n\nBut it could also complicate efforts by Rutte's government to stop ASML Holdings NV, the Netherlands' biggest company, from moving operations abroad.\n\nOne emerging factor is Dutch security priorities, particularly support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\nRutte, who is favoured to become the next NATO secretary general, discussed ASML with Chinese President Xi Jinping when they met in Beijing last week.\n\nHe said afterwards that China's support for Russia was a serious problem at a time when the Netherlands is arming Ukraine with F-16s.\n\n\"It is incredibly important that China understand any victory for Russia (in Ukraine) would pose an immediate threat\" to both the Netherlands and Europe, Rutte said.\n\nHe declined to answer directly whether his government will deny licences for ASML's Chinese customers.\n\nXi told Chinese state media he had warned Rutte against \"decoupling and breaking links\" with China.\n\nSTARTING POINT\n\nWhile Beijing says it is neutral on the Ukraine conflict, Xi has a strategic alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Netherlands holds Russia responsible for the 2014 downing of Malaysia Flight 17 (MH17) over eastern Ukraine, which killed 198 Dutch citizens. It also houses and supports the Hague-based International Criminal Court which has issued a warrant for Putin's arrest on war crimes charges.\n\nStory continues\n\nRutte called on China to do more to keep Russia from obtaining \"dual-use goods\" with both civilian and military applications - such as ASML's machines and the chips they are used to make.\n\nWhile his comments do not translate to a policy of presumptive denial for Chinese customers seeking ASML gear that falls under licensing rules, as U.S. policy does, they do indicate the Dutch government's likely starting point.\n\nASML declined to comment. It has previously said it complies with all export regulations.\n\nEuropean Parliament lawmaker Bart Groothuis said the Netherlands should determine export policy in concert with larger allies.\n\n\"It is much better for us to do that, regulate ASML, together with the U.S., or in the future it may be Europe, and I would say that is the best way forward,\" he said.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's export policy chief Alan Estevez is expected to raise the servicing contracts at a meeting on Monday with Dutch government officials and executives from ASML.\n\nThe Dutch government must weigh its response given fears of weakening U.S. support for its security priorities, including Ukraine, especially if Donald Trump wins November's presidential election.\n\nCASE BY CASE\n\n\"If the U.S. role in NATO decreases, then probably also the leverage that the U.S. has ... with regard to technology transfers to China will decrease,\" said Frans-Paul van der Putten of the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank.\n\nHe said the Dutch see China as \"the only country that has at least some kind of influence on Russia potentially\".\n\nThe Dutch Foreign Ministry, which oversees exports, said on Thursday it will judge Chinese licensing requests the same way it does others: on a \"case by case\" basis, weighing the risks they might end up having undesired military uses.\n\nBut that will be difficult for Dutch officials to determine from afar, especially given Xi's civil-military fusion policies.\n\nFor ASML, the damage from an uncertain number of licence denials will be gradual and limited - maintenance is about 20% of its revenue and China is its third-biggest market after Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nIt has sold 10 billion euros ($11 billion) of equipment to chipmakers in China over the past three years, much of which does not fall under any export restrictions. Some has also gone to plants in China with Western-allied owners, such as SK Hynix and TSMC.\n\nIndividual Chinese chipmakers or plants that are denied a licence could be badly hurt, as ASML machines are essential for making chips and hard to replace.\n\nExperts say, however, that Chinese chipmakers have shown surprising resilience to U.S.-led sanctions so far and will continue to find ways to engineer around them in the future.\n\n\"The cutting-off of servicing is going to inexorably degrade the capabilities of that equipment. And so the manufacturer will be fighting a sort of rearguard action to keep those machines going as long as possible,\" said Paul Triolo, a U.S. expert on China and semiconductors.\n\n\"The question is in the long term, what other workarounds are possible here?\"\n\n($1 = 0.9232 euros)\n\n(Editing by Catherine Evans)",

        "title": "Here Is My Top Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Admittedly, ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) may seem too low profile to become a top artificial intelligence (AI) pick. As an equipment supplier, only fab companies deal with it directly. As a result, it is lesser known, even billing itself as the \"most important tech company you have never heard of.\"\n\nHowever, the stock appears to have become more critical amid the rise of AI. AI applications tend to require the most advanced semiconductors available, a trend that plays into the hands of ASML. Due to the rising demand for chips, ASML looks like an excellent long-term investment and is arguably the most important company for the advancement of AI.\n\nWhy ASML?\n\nIndeed, ASML's anonymity has begun to disappear as investors become more aware of the company's importance. It is the leading producer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, the equipment needed to make the world's most advanced chips.\n\nConsequently, the massive demand for AI-ready chips and advancements in that technology have brought more attention to the manufacturing process. To meet this demand, investors tend to focus on top semiconductor manufacturers such as Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Intel.\n\nNonetheless, investors should also remember that Nvidia's AI-ready H100 chips cannot exist without ASML's equipment. Thus, ASML probably belongs on investor watch lists for that reason alone.\n\nAdditionally, governments worldwide have become increasingly concerned about two-thirds of all third-party chip manufacturing taking place in Taiwan. To this end, the U.S. government, the European Union, and other entities have approved tens of billions in subsidies to build fabs in their home regions. This will further increase demand as many developed countries work to bring semiconductor production home.\n\nStill, that demand may pause in 2024. U.S. and Dutch regulators have restricted the sale of some equipment to China. This will likely lead to negligible revenue growth (or even a slight pullback) in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML by the numbers\n\nHowever, with rising demand for AI chips, ASML's performance beyond 2024 could more closely resemble 2023's results. In 2023, net sales of almost 28 billion euros ($30 billion) rose 30% versus year-ago levels.\n\nDuring that time, ASML increased operating expenses by 39%. This was primarily due to higher research and development costs, money probably invested to maintain its technical lead. Despite that spending, its net income was 7.8 billion euros ($8.5 billion), a 39% increase over the previous year.\n\nThat profit increase, along with rising interest in the stock, helped push ASML's stock price higher by 50% over the last year. Despite that increase, the P/E ratio is about 45, a level near historical averages. Still, with the profit growth the company has seen amid massive investments in semiconductor manufacturing, the stock appears to have room for further growth in the long term.\n\nConsider ASML stock\n\nWhen it comes to AI investing, ASML is the root of the AI industry. Due to its dominance in the EUV machine market, it is the gatekeeper of the fast-growing AI chip industry.\n\nBetween rising demand for AI chips and the urgency of some governments to bring production home, demand for its EUV machines is set to rise. Thus, even at a moderate P/E ratio, investors will likely profit from the stock in the coming years as ASML does its part to make the AI revolution possible.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

The meeting of officials on Monday is one example of that,\" the Ministry told Reuters.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington said Beijing opposes the U.S.'s \"overstretching\" of the concept of national security and use of \"pretexts to coerce other countries into joining its technological blockade against China.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department and ASML, whose shares briefly fell after the news, declined to comment.\n\nThe meeting is Washington's latest move to convince allies to join U.S. efforts to further crack down on Beijing\u2019s ability to produce cutting-edge chips.\n\nLast year, sanctioned Chinese telecoms giant Huawei shocked the world with a new phone powered by a sophisticated chip. The Huawei Mate 60 Pro was seen as a symbol of the China's technological resurgence despite Washington's ongoing efforts to cripple its capacity to produce advanced semiconductors.\n\nChip-related exports to China are vital for its economy. Chinese President Xi Jinping complained to Biden this week about U.S. efforts to block certain U.S. technologies, including advanced semiconductors, saying it hindered China's development.\n\nStory continues\n\nRestrictions on servicing ASML machines could be particularly painful given the large and expensive tools require constant maintenance. China was ASML's second-largest market by sales last year (29%), after Taiwan.\n\nLast year, Japan and the Netherlands joined a U.S. effort to keep certain chipmaking technology from China for national security reasons. The Dutch government began restricting certain deep ultraviolet (DUV) equipment for Chinese customers and partially revoked one license, impacting a small number of customers in China, according to ASML.\n\nBut the Dutch restrictions did not go as far as U.S. rules, which barred American firms from servicing equipment at advanced Chinese factories. Estevez has said publicly that the U.S. is asking allies to stop local companies from servicing certain chipmaking tools for Chinese customers.\n\n\"We are working with our allies to determine what is important to service and what is not important to service,\" Estevez said at an export control conference last week.\n\nIn October, the U.S. issued a regulation to keep more ASML DUV machines from certain Chinese chip factories because American parts in those tools gave Washington the power to regulate their export from overseas. Officials may broach expanding the list of Chinese factories at the Monday meeting, one of the sources said.\n\nLast week, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit in Beijing. Xi warned against setting up trade barriers.\n\nRutte said Dutch restrictions aim to disrupt business as little as possible.\n\nHowever, Rutte said China's support for Russia, which the Netherlands views as its top national security threat, is a major impediment to relations \u2013 a signal that exports of goods with potential military uses to China will be scrutinized. Rutte is a top candidate to become NATO's next secretary general.\n\n(Reporting by Karen Freifeld in New York, Alexandra Alper in Washington, D.C., and Toby Sterling in Amsterdam; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Lisa Shumaker and David Gregorio)",

        "title": "Explainer-Why maintaining ASML equipment is the new front in US-China chip war",
        "content": "By Toby Sterling\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The U.S. government has called on allies to force computer chip manufacturing equipment companies to stop maintaining some of the tools they have sold in China, part of Washington's efforts to undermine China's ability to produce its own advanced computer chips.\n\nAs the largest maker of chipmaking equipment globally, ASML of the Netherlands is in focus.\n\nHere are questions and answers about the scope of the issue and what is at stake for the U.S., Netherlands, ASML, and Chinese chipmakers.\n\nWHY DOES ASML EQUIPMENT MATTER?\n\nASML dominates the market for lithography tools - huge expensive, complex machines that perform one step in the chipmaking process, helping to create circuitry.\n\nWHY WOULD THE U.S. NOT WANT ASML TO MAINTAIN EQUIPMENT IT HAS ALREADY SOLD?\n\nTo stop a targeted Chinese chipmaking plant or \"fab\" from being able to operate. ASML machines are somewhere between difficult and impossible to replace. If an owner is denied spare parts and maintenance, at some point the machine would stop working and the fab would be unable to produce chips.\n\nWOULD THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT DENY MAINTENANCE LICENCES?\n\nThe Dutch government, a close U.S. ally, has not ruled out denying export licences - which cover both exports and maintenance - to ASML in some cases where it sees a security risk. However, it has no plans for a blanket ban.\n\nDutch export licensing policy is not aimed at China, an important trading partner, and the Dutch government does not want to harm ASML, its biggest company.\n\nIn addition, much of the equipment ASML sells in China is used in less advanced chipmaking processes and does not require a Dutch licence to export or maintain.\n\nHOW MUCH ASML EQUIPMENT IS IN CHINA?\n\nLots. ASML sold more than 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) worth of equipment to Chinese customers last year alone.\n\nThe company does not disclose how much falls into categories that require a licence - in industry terms, the \"immersion\" segment of DUV lithography tools. That's ASML's upper middle range. Its best tools are not sold in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nWHAT DOES ASML SAY?\n\nASML has export licences in place to service the majority of its Chinese customers until Dec. 31 this year, the company said in an emailed answer to Reuters' questions last month.\n\nWHAT MIGHT THE IMPACT BE ON CHINESE CHIPMAKERS?\n\nThis is uncertain. Take the fictional example of a Chinese chipmaker that has bought one of ASML's best immersion lithography DUV tools for $60 million, but does not have its licence renewed.\n\nU.S. expert Paul Triolo, who notes that Chinese companies have generally found ways around U.S.-led restrictions, described a process of decline over weeks or months.\n\nWithout software updates, the system would not operate optimally. But Chinese engineers know how to operate their machines, and could be rehired if they are unable to work for ASML.\n\nSome of the thousands of parts in an ASML tool are replaceable or repairable if they break down. However, when it comes to highly specialized lenses and lasers, there are no known alternatives.\n\nSome parts could arguably be cannibalized from existing ASML machines. Most of the machines ASML has ever made are still in service - but nobody has ever tried running an advanced machine without the company's help.\n\nWHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR ASML?\n\nLikely minor, at least at first. China was ASML's second market in 2023 after Taiwan, with 29% of sales, slightly ahead of South Korea. About 20% of ASML's total revenues comes from the servicing of installed machines.\n\nWhile ASML dominates its market, it faces competition at the lower end of its product range from Nikon and Canon of Japan, and from domestic Chinese firm SMEE.\n\nChinese chipmakers will be highly motivated over time to develop alternatives to using ASML gear.\n\n($1 = 0.9203 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Jan Harvey)",

        "content": "Towards the end of the just completed first quarter, U.S.-based hedge funds began dumping American equities and shifting capital into European stocks. In an analysis, investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) found that hedge funds \u201chave bought EU equities in nearly 70% of the trading sessions\u201d since the European stock market began to rally in January of this year. Hedge fund exposure to Europe has grown from below 17% at the end of 2023 to roughly 19% at the end of Q1 this year, says Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe move into European stocks comes amid growing concerns that U.S. equities have become too expensive and are in overbought territory. Europe\u2019s main STOXX 600 index is up 7% so far this year, lagging the 10% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index in the U.S. The S&P 500 index currently trades at 21 times forward earnings estimates, while European equities trade at 14 times, according to data from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\n\nIn a recent note to clients, investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said that \u201cEurope has room to catch up with the U.S.\u201d as the discount between both is the deepest it has ever been. Here is hedge fund favorites: three European stocks attracting significant U.S. investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoros Fund, the hedge fund controlled by billionaire investor George Soros, began loading up on shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) last autumn, buying 1.5 million shares worth $138.8 million. Soros Fund is one of several hedge funds that have been buying up stock of the company that makes the popular weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Soaring demand for the weight loss medications has NVO stock up 60% in the last 12 months, including a 25% gain so far in 2024.\n\nHuge demand for its weight loss drugs and rising stock price has made Novo Nordisk Europe\u2019s largest publicly traded company with a current market capitalization of $437.25 billion. Hedge funds have been buying up NVO stock on expectations of strong future earnings and as the company develops a weight loss pill to replace the current injections that are used to administer the medications. A pill is forecast to be a gamechanger for the burgeoning market for weight loss prescriptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nDutch semiconductor company ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is owned by so many hedge funds that in February of this year, Morgan Stanley put out a report stating that ASML is one of Europe\u2019s most \u201cover-owned\u201d stocks. The company specializes in the development and manufacturing of photolithography machines that are essential to the production of computer microchips. Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling demand for ASML\u2019s technology, sending the stock up nearly 40% this year alone.\n\nAppaloosa Management is a hedge funds that\u2019s been betting big on ASML stock since the second half of last year, run by famed investor David Tepper. Appaloosa first opened a position in ASML Holdings stock last August, buying $58 million worth of shares. The hedge fund has steadily increased its stake since then. ASML Holding is growing its role in the global semiconductor market, particularly in China, as AI technologies fuel a renaissance in the sector.\n\nStar Bulk Carriers (SBLK) A large ULCV container ship underway, sails on open water fully loaded with containers and cargo - the ZIM San Francisco\n\nSource: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nStar Bulk Carriers (NASDAQ:SBLK) is a lesser known European company and stock. Based in Greece, Star Bulk Carriers is a global shipping company. It operates a fleet of carrier vessels that transports iron ore, coal, and grain between Europe, North America and Asia. SBLK stock gets little attention, but has proven to be a very good investment. It has risen 14% in the last 12 months and 222% in the past five years. The stock also trades at only 13 times future earnings estimates.\n\nSBLK stock pays a hefty quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share, giving it a yield of 6%. So which hedge fund titans own Star Bulk Carriers? None other than Michael Burry, the famed investor profiled in the book and film The Big Short. Burry owns 250,000 shares of the company currently valued at just under $6 million. Star Bulk Carriers is one of only a few European stocks held by Burry\u2019s Scion Asset Management hedge fund, according to its latest 13F securities filing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "ASML Netherlands BV\n\nASML cautions investors regarding Tutanota LLC\u2019s \u201cmini-tender\u201d offer\n\nVELDHOVEN, the Netherlands, March 28, 2024 \u2013 ASML Holding NV (ASML) today announced that it recently became aware of an unsolicited \u201cmini-tender\u201d offer by Tutanota LLC to purchase up to 250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand) of ASML\u2019s ordinary shares, nominal value \u20ac0.09 per share, representing significantly less than 0.1% of ASML\u2019s ordinary shares, at an offer price of $1,075 net per share.\n\nASML is not associated in any way with Tutanota or its mini-tender offer and recommends that shareholders reject this unsolicited mini-tender offer. Any shareholder considering tendering to the offer should exercise caution, carefully review the Tutanota offer documents, obtain current market quotations for their shares and consult with their broker or financial adviser.\n\nASML recommends that shareholders do not tender their shares in response to Tutanota\u2019s offer because Tutanota\u2019s offer is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of ASML\u2019s ordinary shares exceeding the offer price on the last trading day before the offer expires and is subject to numerous additional conditions, including Tutanota obtaining financing for the offer. Tutanota also states in its offer documents that it expects to extend the offer for successive periods of up to 180 days until the market price of ASML\u2019s ordinary shares exceeds the offer price. This means that ASML shareholders who tender their shares in the offer would receive a below-market price for their shares if the offer conditions are satisfied and shares are purchased in the offer.\n\nAccording to Tutanota\u2019s offer documents, shareholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them by following the procedures described in the offer documents. ASML recommends shareholders who have already tendered their shares to consider withdrawing their tendered shares.\n\nTutanota has made similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for stock of other public companies. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than five percent of a company\u2019s outstanding shares, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the SEC that would otherwise apply. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided by larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) has cautioned investors about these offers, issuing the guidance available at https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsminitend. ASML also strongly encourages brokers, dealers and other market participants to exercise caution and to review the SEC\u2019s letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML warns investors that the offer does not comply with, and does not offer the protections of, the public offer regulations of the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act. Tutanota's offer documents have not been approved by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets, the AFM.\n\nASML requests that a copy of this news release be included with all distributions of materials related to Tutanota\u2019s mini-tender offer for ASML\u2019s ordinary shares.\n\nASML historical financial information can be found on https://www.asml.com/en/investors.\n\nMedia Relations contacts Investor Relations contacts Monique Mols +31 6 5284 4418 Skip Miller +1 480 235 0934 Sarah de Crescenzo +1 925 899 8985 Marcel Kemp +31 40 268 6494 Karen Lo +886 939788635 Peter Cheang +886 3 659 6771\n\nAbout ASML\r\nASML is a leading supplier to the semiconductor industry.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 most profitable tech stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\nNow, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.\n\nSo naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public. With the first quarter of the new year now ending, analysts and investors are pouring over the latest products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling. NVIDIA recently held its GTC Developers conference, an annual event, where it revealed its latest Blackwell GPU for AI. This GPU promises to reduce operating costs and energy usage by up to 25 times when compared to predecessors.\n\nNVIDIA's chief Jensen Huang also provided details about Blackwell's design and costs in an interview with CNBC where he shared:\n\nYes, a mathematician, right? Yeah, yeah, really terrific mathematician. And this computer here will replace thousands of general-purpose computers. This is the part that's incredible. In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence.\n\nJensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion. NVIDIA is currently valued at $2.28 trillion, making the multi billion dollar spend a drop in its massive market capitalization. The shares have gained 248% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 Information Technology index's 53% gain over the past year by a wide margin.\n\nSo, with the dynamics of the global technology industry shifting, we decided to take a look at the top tech stocks in terms of net profit that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most profitable tech stocks to invest in, we ranked all technology companies by their trailing twelve month net income and picked the top stocks.\n\nFor these most profitable tech stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\n16.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best tech and disruptive ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the tech landscape, head over to Investing in Innovation: 5 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs.\n\nHigh inflation, rising interest rates, and global uncertainties, resulting in softer consumer spending, reduced product demand, market capitalization declines, and workforce reductions made headlines in 2022. These headwinds continued into 2023, with a slight decline in global tech spending and increasing layoffs. Nonetheless, economists are now less concerned about the risk of recession, with analysts optimistic about modest growth potential in the tech sector for 2024. Despite ongoing global and economic uncertainties, Deloittesuggests that it is time to refocus on innovation and growth. Their 2024 technology industry outlook identifies key trends and strategies expected to shape tech leaders' priorities, including (1) Aiming for a comeback with support from cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity technologies; (2) Balancing globalization with self-reliance to mitigate risks associated with geopolitical unrest, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory changes; (3) Preparing for growth opportunities with generative AI applications; and (4) Addressing regulatory challenges as governments worldwide assess the impacts of tech platforms on businesses and consumers.\n\nKen Englund, EY Americas TMT Leader, commented:\n\n\u201cIn 2023 the tech industry navigated global economic headwinds and geopolitical tensions, while building widespread expectation around the potential of AI. The opportunity for the year ahead is clear. By putting AI at the center of their strategies, tech businesses could leapfrog competitors who were previously ahead, not only by accelerating their transformation journeys but also repositioning operations to capitalize on rapidly emerging technologies and business models.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Olivier Wolf, EY-Parthenon Global TMT Leader, siad:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding regulatory hurdles associated with AI deals, huge potential remains. The platform nature of today\u2019s tech businesses means there will be many attractive companies with business models based on existing AI ecosystems. The optimal way to expand will be through a blend of small- to medium-sized acquisitions, corporate investments and partnerships, that will help companies access intellectual property and the skills needed to develop new propositions quickly.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, the technology market offers numerous promising opportunities, including the rapid expansion of the Asia Pacific region, high demand for software, the potential of generative AI, and the increasing focus on green and digital innovation. Economic conditions are expected to improve with lower energy prices, stabilizing supply chains, and decreasing inflation. Forresterforecasts global tech spending to reach $4.7 trillion in 2024, marking a 5.3% growth compared to 2023's 3.5%. The IMF's World Economic Outlook highlights the Asia Pacific region as a leader in growth, with India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and China expected to see significant real GDP growth in 2024. India, a major exporter of technology services, is projected to experience a 9.5% growth in domestic and government tech spending. In China, the digital economy is anticipated to contribute 41.5% to GDP. North America is forecasted to grow by 5.4%, with financial services and healthcare leading tech spending growth. Software and IT services are expected to dominate US tech spending, capturing 60% by 2027. The US government is allocating $25 billion to emerging technologies in 2024 through initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act agencies. Europe is expected to grow by 5.1%, rebounding from a challenging 2023. However, further acceleration of tech spending is needed to meet digital technology enterprise targets.\n\nForrester advises companies to prioritise investments in software, generative AI, and green and digital innovation. Software revenues, including custom and off-the-shelf solutions, are projected to grow at double-digit rates, fueled by robust demand for cloud services. Investments in generative AI software are forecasted to increase by 36% annually through 2030, reaching $227 billion, with major players like Microsoft and Google Cloud experiencing significant revenue growth in this domain. Large consulting firms are pivoting towards AI solutions delivery, with firms like Capgemini planning multi-billion-dollar investments in generative AI. Partnerships between generative AI companies and hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle facilitate access to computing power. Additionally, companies are urged to focus on green and digital innovation, as initiatives like Europe's Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact aim for carbon neutrality in data centers by 2030. Innovative firms investing in green and digital initiatives experience accelerated revenue growth, while increased digital technology investment leads to enhanced productivity growth.\n\nCathie Wood's Latest Thoughts on Innovation Investing\n\nCathie Wood is always mentioned when the subject on hand is innovation. In an interview last month with OPTO, Wood commented that the technologies that are making waves today, their roots were laid down 20 years ago, at the end of the Telecom bubble. She referred to multiomic sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, noting that these technologies are now ready for prime time, with growth rates ranging from 20%-50% per year. Cathie Wood expects a convergence of these five major technologies at one point, which will result in 'super exponential growth'. Already strong growth rates will speed up further, resulting in enormous productivity gains and potential for wealth generation. She stated that AI is a huge catalyst for productivity gains, and it is accelerating the efficiency of the other major market technologies. Wood also mentioned that robotics will lead to massive increases in productivity, especially humanoid robotics, as they take over dangerous and extremely mundane tasks from humans.\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, robo taxis or autonomous taxi platforms are likely to experience the largest revenue boom as three technologies converge, which are robotics, energy storage, and artificial intelligence. She highlighted that autonomous vehicles have a tremendous revenue opportunity of $8-$10 trillion globally over the next 5 to 10 years. In this context, she sees huge profit margins for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a platform provider for autonomous vehicles. Among the Magnificent 7, Wood sees positive outcomes for Tesla due to autonomous vehicles and Meta Platforms since it is well-integrated into the AI ecosystem and is big on social commerce. However, for Amazon and Google, Wood sees trouble since she noted that AI will disintermediate data aggregators at point. She further pointed out the boom in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, noting that Bitcoin rose 40% last year when Silicon Valley Banks and others banks collapsed. The SEC's green light with the crypto ETFs also helped the industry. This will also impact Coinbase positively in the long run, as per Cathie Wood. Coinbase is Wood's largest portfolio holding as of Q4 2023.\n\nSome of the top tech stocks to buy include Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals\u2014Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\n\nOr how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year\u2019s projected revenue. That revenue that could be competed away over time, while Intel\u2019s semiconductor \u201cfabs\u201d in the US are increasingly valuable as the east and the west drift further apart.\u201d\n\n9.

(NASDAQ:META)\u2014both categorized in the communication services sector\u2014rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta\u2019s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix\u2019s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year\u2019s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta\u2019s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.\u201d\n\n6.

(NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world\u2019s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Investing in Innovation: 5 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 States With the Most Federal Workers in the US 20 Biggest Energy Companies in Australia for 2024 Billionaire Steve Cohen and Insiders Are Buying These 10 Stocks\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "ASML (ASML) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned +5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, which ASML Holding falls in, has gained 3.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nASML Holding is expected to post earnings of $2.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.97 indicates a change of +41.6% from what ASML Holding is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ASML Holding.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of ASML Holding, the consensus sales estimate of $5.73 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -20.9%. The $30.46 billion and $38 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.2% and +24.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nASML Holding reported revenues of $7.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $5.60 for the same period compares with $4.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.2%. The EPS surprise was +9.38%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nASML Holding is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ASML Holding. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is ASML Headed for a Stock Split in 2024?",
        "content": "ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) often refers to itself as \"the most important tech company you've never heard of.\" Still, that moniker is likely becoming less accurate as more investors become aware of the company's importance in the production of equipment that creates the world's most advanced semiconductors.\n\nThat realization likely played a role in taking its stock price around $1,000 per share, making it the 20th most expensive stock trading on U.S. exchanges today. Such a nominal price leads investors to ask if ASML will finally approve a stock split this year.\n\nThe state of ASML and its stock\n\nAdmittedly, the prospects of a stock split this year or any other time amount to speculation. The company has not telegraphed any intentions to split its stock.\n\nAdditionally, ASML has not approved any splits in years. After three stock splits during the dot-com bubble, its last action of this type was an 8-for-9 reverse stock split in 2007.\n\nNonetheless, the company has changed since that time. Since 2007, it has attained a leadership in producing extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. That has given the company a seemingly insurmountable competitive advantage. As a result, equipment from competitors such as Lam Research and Applied Materials can only compete in less advanced parts of the semiconductor industry.\n\nHence, fabrication plants owned by companies like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung need ASML's EUV machines to produce the world's most advanced semiconductors, which power cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis makes ASML irreplaceable in the semiconductor supply chain. Moreover, manufacturers have received tens of billions in subsidies to produce such chips outside of Taiwan, the location for about two-thirds of the world's third-party production capacity. Thus, ASML will probably play a critical role in this move.\n\nWhy ASML might eventually split its stock\n\nIndeed, ASML's technical lead likely makes the Netherlands-based equipment maker a buy, regardless of whether the company approves a stock split. Also, stock splits do not change valuations or the size of ownership positions in a direct sense. One share at $1,000 per share is worth the same as 10 shares at $100 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, investors have some reasons to believe a split will occur and possibly boost interest in ASML. One reason is the company's aforementioned history of stock splits and the changes within the company over the last 17 years. Since the reverse split, the stock has risen more than 28-fold, giving it the highest nominal prices in its history.\n\nAdditionally, a lower nominal share price gives smaller investors more reason to pay attention to ASML and buy shares. Yes, these investors can purchase fractional shares, but the fact that fractional shares may involve added fees (if they are available at all) may reduce the appeal of such a strategy.\n\nFurthermore, a share split is a bullish psychological sign. It telegraphs to investors that the company expects the stock price to rise. Also, with the demand for AI chips exploding and efforts to build more fabs worldwide, ASML shares should remain on a growth trajectory for years to come. Hence, a near-term split may not be the last time the company takes such an action.\n\nASML and stock splits\n\nASML has not indicated it will split its shares, but it has good reasons to do so. Its role as the leading equipment manufacturer and the rising demand for that equipment should mean a secular bull market for the semiconductor stock for years to come.\n\nAdmittedly, the company's nominal share price does not affect that trend. Nonetheless, a likely psychological boost and heightened interest from small investors would give investors more reasons to consider such a move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. and a secretive chipmaking partner in China have filed patents for a low-tech but potentially effective way to make advanced semiconductors, raising the prospect that China could improve chip production techniques despite US efforts to halt its progress.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is Unpaid Baltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each What Happens If Trump Can\u2019t Post His $454 Million Bond Trump-Tied SPAC Deal Approved, Setting Up Potential Windfall China Scrutinizes PwC Role in $78 Billion Evergrande Fraud Case\n\nThe companies are developing technologies that involve self-aligned quadruple patterning, or SAQP, and should reduce their reliance on high-end lithography, according to patent filings to the Chinese intellectual property authority. That may allow them to produce advanced chips without ASML Holding NV\u2019s state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment. Netherlands-based ASML, the sole provider of EUV machines, cannot sell them into China because of export controls.\n\nQuadruple patterning is a technique for etching lines on silicon wafers multiple times to increase transistor density \u2014 and therefore performance. Huawei\u2019s patent application, released on Friday, describes a method that uses the technology to make more sophisticated semiconductors. \u201cAdoption of this patent will increase the design freedom of circuit patterns,\u201d said the filing to China National Intellectual Property Administration.\n\nSiCarrier, a state-backed chipmaking gear developer that works with Huawei, was granted a patent that involves SAQP, in late 2023. Its patent employs deep ultraviolet lithography, or DUV, chipmaking machines and the SAQP technology to achieve certain technical thresholds seen on 5 nanometer chips, according to its filing. The practice can avoid the use of EUV machines while reducing manufacturing cost, it said.\n\nQuadruple-patterning technology is good enough for China to make chips at 5nm, but China still needs to get its hands on EUV machines in the long run, according to Dan Hutcheson, vice-chairman at research firm TechInsights. \u201cIt can mitigate them, but not completely overcome the technical issues of not having EUV,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nLeading chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. use EUV machines to produce advanced chips because they have the highest production yields \u2014 meaning the cost per chip is minimized. If Huawei and its partners use alternative methods for semiconductor production, their cost per chip may be higher than the industry\u2019s standards.\n\nThe most advanced chips now in commercial production use 3nm technology, including chips that TSMC makes for the likes of Apple Inc. China is currently capable of making 7nm chips, two generations behind, but advancing to 5nm would put it only a single generation behind the global leaders.\n\nThe US and its allies have been tightening China\u2019s access to semiconductors and chipmaking equipment for years, with the Biden administration arguing such controls are necessary for national security. That includes bans on the export of ASML\u2019s EUV chipmaking machines and Nvidia Corp.\u2019s most powerful graphic processors, used for training artificial intelligence services.\n\nRead More: US Can\u2019t Halt SMIC, Huawei\u2019s Tech Advances, Chip Guru Says\n\nBut Chinese companies are investing billions to develop their domestic chip capabilities and Huawei unveiled a breakthrough smartphone last year that was powered by an advanced 7nm processor. That suggested the country\u2019s tech sector is making progress despite the efforts of the US, the Netherlands and Japan.\n\nIn response, the Biden administration is looking for additional means to contain China\u2019s progress. It\u2019s pressing allies like South Korea and Germany to join the effort, and is considering blacklisting even more Chinese chip firms linked to Huawei, including SiCarrier.\n\nA cohort of Chinese chip equipment makers including Naura Technology Group Co. and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc., are also looking into complementing multiple patterning technology with etching systems to produce 7nm or more advanced chips because EUVs are out of reach, according to a memo authored by Citigroup\u2019s analysts including Jamie Wang and Kevin Chen.\n\n\u201cChinese semiconductor companies mainly resort to SAQP to produce advanced chips, which could increase the density of etching machines in China,\u201d it said.\n\nBeijing this year has thrown its backing fully behind the nation\u2019s most prominent suppliers of chipmaking gear. This month, Premier Li Qiang visited the offices of Naura Technology in a widely publicized personal tour, usually orchestrated to signal central government support.\n\n--With assistance from Jessica Sui.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Don Lemon Implosion Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $1,150 and Hold for Decades",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a big deal today, primarily because the stock market looks ahead. It can see the long-term potential a new technology like AI has to change our world. According to Grand View Research, the global AI market was $200 billion last year and will grow nearly 40% annually through 2030.\n\nNow is the time to place your long-term bets, choosing the top AI companies that have the potential to outperform both competitors and the broader stock market over the coming years.\n\nSome high-potential stocks stand out from the crowd.\u00a0Here is why investors should consider buying and holding Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW), Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR), and ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) for decades to come. And you can get a share of all three of them for less than $1,150 at today's prices.\n\n1. Storing and organizing data will be critical to AI\n\nSnowflake is becoming crucial to AI. Artificial intelligence models require vast amounts of data on which to train. Snowflake is a data cloud that stores customers' data on its cloud-based platform. Customers can easily query data from Snowflake, which indexes and stores it neatly, making it easy to use. Additionally, Snowflake enables customers to share and source data from third parties.\n\nData grows exponentially. The more digital our world is, the more data we create. And data doesn't expire; it simply stacks up as time passes. That's why most of the world's data was only recently created. That statement will likely be true 10, 20, 30 years from now. Snowflake charges are based on the computing and storage customers use. It helps customers fit Snowflake into their budget. It also sets up long-term revenue growth as increasing amounts of data require more storage and computing power.\n\nSnowflake is a key industry player, with privately held Databricks as its primary competitor. Snowflake works on top of the major cloud platforms, making them almost more of a partner than a competitor. Its usage-based billing may create some volatility in Snowflake's short-term growth, but the long-term trend should point up.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Companies will need help deploying AI applications\n\nAny technology investor who reads earnings reports has likely seen how much every company seemingly mentions AI as part of the future. But not many companies know how to implement AI into their business. That's where Palantir Technologies' opportunity lies. The company builds and deploys custom software for government and commercial clients on its three platforms: Gotham, Foundry, and, most recently, its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).\n\nAIP is for deploying AI apps, and CEO Alex Karp noted that customer interest in deploying AI via Palantir is tremendous. It's showing up in the numbers, too. Palantir's U.S. commercial-customer count grew 55% year over year in the fourth quarter and 22% quarter over quarter. Note that Palantir still has just 221 U.S. clients versus a market opportunity of thousands of corporations in the U.S. alone.\n\nIt's not a giant leap to imagine Palantir's commercial customer base multiplying in size over the next decade and beyond. It's all supported by strong ties to the U.S. government that gives the company a high floor. U.S. government deals contribute roughly half of Palantir's total revenue today.\n\n3. The machines behind AI's cutting-edge chips\n\nAI chips are currently the primary arms race in the technology industry. Everyone is chasing Nvidia, it seems, which grabbed hold of the chip market with its cutting-edge AI hardware. But ASML doesn't have to care whose chips everyone uses. That's because it makes the machines that make the chips. These machines use extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) to create delicate designs on silicon wafers.\n\nMany don't realize this, but the EUV machines that make the tiniest and most advanced chips come from only one company in the world: ASML. Yep, it's a legitimate monopoly. Only ASML has the know-how and patents to build these machines. That means that in some way or another, ASML's products will be in demand as long as AI models require increasingly advanced chips.\n\nAccording to Mordor Intelligence, the EUV market is worth approximately $10 billion today and will grow by an average of 11% annually to almost $18 billion by 2029. Investors can buy ASML in confidence, knowing that the drive for innovation in AI will keep business hot for the company's unique machines for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Snowflake wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency",
        "content": "Many of the market's top cryptocurrencies surged over the past 12 months. Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) price rose more than 180% as the first spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved and investors looked toward the next \"halving\" which will cut the rewards for Bitcoin mining in half this April. Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) price has also jumped nearly 130% as the Ethereum Network's big Dencun upgrade and hopes for fresh ETF approvals brought back the bulls.\n\nExpectations for stable or lower interest rates also drove more investors back toward cryptocurrencies. That shift might herald the end of the \"crypto winter\" that started in 2022, but cryptocurrencies are still riskier than most tech stocks -- since they're only trading on supply and demand instead of the growth of an underlying business. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo if you're looking for growth but can't stomach the crypto market's wild swings, you can buy some high-growth tech stocks, which might still have more upside potential than the top cryptocurrencies. I believe Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), and ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) check all the right boxes. Let's find out a bit more about these three tech stocks with so much potential.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia became the world's third-most-valuable company in early March. Its market cap hit $2.2 trillion as the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market drove more companies to purchase its data center GPUs to process their AI tasks.\n\nNvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), which greatly reduced its dependence on gaming and professional visualization GPUs for the PC market. The expansion of that business was driven by the soaring popularity of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 126% and 288%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as the AI market grew. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to soar another 81% and 89%, respectively, in fiscal 2025. Based on those bullish expectations, Nvidia's stock doesn't seem expensive at 36 times forward earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSupermicro (as the company is better known) produces high-performance servers for data centers. It controls a smaller slice of the enterprise server market than Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell, but its close relationship with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's top-tier data center GPUs before its larger competitors.\n\nThe partnership enabled Supermicro to carve out a niche in the rapidly growing market for dedicated AI servers. That's why its revenue and adjusted EPS rose 37% and 109%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June). Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise another 104% and 86%, respectively, in fiscal 2024.\n\nThose are astounding growth rates for a stock that trades at 34 times forward earnings. It's also been developing AI servers that use Advanced Micro Devices' new AI-oriented GPUs -- and that shift should reduce its long-term dependence on Nvidia.\n\n3. ASML\n\nASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems for optically etching circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems -- which leading foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing use to manufacture their smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.\n\nLike many other chipmakers, Nvidia outsources its manufacturing to TSMC -- but TSMC can't produce those high-end chips without ASML's machines. That's why ASML is an indispensable linchpin of the global semiconductor industry. That reputation, along with its lack of meaningful competitors, gives it unmatched pricing power.\n\nASML's revenue and EPS rose 30% and 41%, respectively, in 2023. But in 2024, analysts expect its revenue to rise less than 1% as its EPS dips 4%. That slowdown will be caused by tighter export curbs on its shipments to Chinese chipmakers and the excess inventory of chips in the PC and smartphone markets. However, it expects its growth to accelerate again in 2025 as it overcomes those challenges -- so I believe its stock deserves its higher valuation at 43 times forward earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 sector ETFs and International ETFs. If you want to see our discussion on the US and international economies, head directly to Diversified Stock Portfolio: 5 Sector ETFs and International ETFs To Buy.\n\nIn the beginning of 2023, investors were cautiously optimistic about inflation cooling down and anticipated interest rate cuts, while also keeping an eye out for signs of an economic recession and lower corporate earnings. However, the economy outperformed these expectations, driven by higher-than-expected consumer savings, increased fiscal spending, and looser financial conditions. This led to a 25% increase in the S&P 500 Index in 2023, bringing the benchmark close to its record high from January 2022. The enthusiastic market rally at the end of 2023 has resulted in overvalued stocks, particularly as investors were encouraged by the Federal Reserve's indication in December that rate cuts could be imminent.\n\nLooking ahead, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Global Investment Committee suggests that investors should adopt a more cautious approach, as 2024 is more likely to be an average year for markets rather than another year of double-digit growth. Analysts are predicting 2024 US corporate earnings to be around $242 per share, assuming that companies will continue to expand their profit margins. However, this estimate may be overly optimistic, considering that US economic growth is expected to taper off from last year's rapid pace of about 7% to around 4% this year. This slowdown could lead to a decrease in sales volume and pricing power for companies. Additionally, corporations may have already realized the benefits of lower manufacturing costs and declining oil and raw material prices, which may not contribute as significantly to improved margins in the future. Morgan Stanley believes that 2024 should be a time for balance, both for investors' expectations and their portfolios.\n\nLooking at the international landscape, economists predict that the European economy is poised for a year of transition after a turbulent 2023, with key challenges like high inflation and increasing interest rates expected to diminish. CNBCnoted that despite the challenging economic conditions in the Eurozone, the pan-European Stoxx 600 stock index ended the year 12.6% higher, driven by optimism about potential monetary policy changes in 2024 by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Stock markets in Europe and globally have started 2024 on a more uncertain note, awaiting new data and signals from central banks. Global markets saw a rally in the final months of 2023, as bond yields retreated on hopes that the Fed and ECB would start cutting interest rates early in 2024. However, the ECB has not yet indicated any immediate easing of policy, despite market expectations for a rate cut in March. Jari Stehn, Chief European Economist at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhile wage growth is still firm and the labour market remains resilient, we expect both to soften in 2024 and look for core inflation to reach 2% year-on-year in [the fourth quarter of 2024], much earlier than projected by the ECB. As a result, we see earlier and faster policy rate cuts than implied by the Governing Council\u2019s recent communication.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Chinese economy in 2023 faced challenges as it emerged from COVID lockdown. Initially, there was a surge in business activity, especially in the services sector. However, this boost was short-lived, and the property market's troubles intensified. The distress faced by Country Garden Services Holdings Company Limited, one of China's major private developers, had a ripple effect, shaking business and investor confidence. The property market woes spilled over into consumer sentiment and strained local government finances. To address these issues, policymakers took steps such as policy rate cuts and fiscal support. These measures helped soften the economic impact but did not lead to a significant uptick in economic activity. As we enter 2024, there are known challenges ahead, but uncertainty remains about the future. While policymakers have outlined their goals and plans, there are doubts about how these will be implemented and their effectiveness.\n\nIn South Asia, India's $4 trillion stock market is attracting significant investments from both domestic and foreign investors, positioning itself as a rapidly growing alternative to China. Despite concerns about overpriced shares, upcoming elections, and regulatory uncertainties, investors are showing confidence in India's market potential. The NSE Nifty 50 Index has surged by a third in the past months, with foreign inflows reaching $20 billion in 2023, according to India's national depository data. In 2024, India's appeal is increasing as global investors seek alternatives to Chinese markets. There is also growing anticipation that the national elections this year will result in Prime Minister Narendra Modi securing a third term, further bolstering investor confidence in India's economic prospects.\n\nSimilarly, the Japanese stock market had a remarkable 2023, with the Nikkei 225 Index posting its fastest gain in a decade, reaching its highest level since the end of Japan's bubble economy in 1989. The Tokyo Stock Price Index also saw a rise, marking its fourth-best annual performance since 2001 by mid-November 2023 in local currency terms. As perForbes, the positive trend in Japanese equities is expected to continue in 2024, supported by favorable market conditions and regulatory environment, along with backing from influential investors. Despite global challenges such as high interest rates, sluggish economic growth, and persistent inflation, major institutional investors like BlackRock remain optimistic about Japan's prospects. BlackRock announced in September 2023 that it would increase its investment in the world's second-largest economy. The BlackRock Institute stated:\n\n\u201cWe turn even more positive on Japanese equities, going overweight due to strong earnings, share buy backs and other shareholder-friendly corporate reforms.\u201d\n\nThis article discusses some of the best performing sector and international ETFs that provide investors with access to stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and ATI Inc.

SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSE:FEZ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 44.02%\n\nThe SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSE:FEZ) aims to mirror the total return performance of the EURO STOXX 50 Index, which represents some of the largest companies in the 20 EURO STOXX Supersector Indexes. Launched on October 15, 2002, the ETF has assets under management totaling $3.28 billion as of March 14, 2024, with its portfolio comprising 50 stocks. The fund has a gross expense ratio of 0.29% as of March 17, 2024.\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is the top holding of the SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSE:FEZ). The company specializes in the development, production, marketing, sale, and maintenance of advanced semiconductor equipment systems used by semiconductor manufacturers.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds were bullish on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), up from 57 funds in the preceding quarter. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management held the largest position in the company, with 4.97 million shares valued at $3.76 billion.\n\nIn addition to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and ATI Inc. (NYSE:ATI), ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the best stocks to add to your stock portfolio.\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNetherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world\u2019s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.\u201d\n\n10. BNY Mellon International Equity ETF (NYSE:BKIE)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 46.57%\n\nThe BNY Mellon International Equity ETF (NYSE:BKIE) aims to mirror the performance of the Solactive GBS Developed Markets ex United States Large & Mid Cap Index NTR. It offers investors exposure to global stocks through a passively managed, low-cost index strategy with full portfolio transparency, making it a good pick for investors\u2019 stock portfolio. Launched on April 22, 2020, the fund has amassed net assets amounting to $616.37 million as of March 15, 2024, with an expense ratio of 0.04%.

Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 14.13 million shares worth $1.46 billion.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAs we discussed in last quarter\u2019s commentary, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a newer addition to the strategy. Over the fourth quarter, we continued to build the position to an average weight. As a reminder, Novo Nordisk is a global pharmaceutical company based in Denmark and has long been the leader in developing insulin for diabetes patients. In recent years, the company\u2019s innovation into GLP-1 drugs has been shown not only to help diabetics control blood sugar levels but also to have significant efficacy in weight loss. Obesity has become a global epidemic, creating materially negative knock-on effects for humans that range from an increase in cardiovascular events and, thus, higher mortality to a lower general quality of life. We believe that, over time, payors will recognize the value of these obesity treatments to both patients and the overall healthcare system.\u201d\n\n9.

We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses. We hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again in the future.\u201d\n\n7.

Though we do not currently own it in the Portfolio, Taiwan Semiconductor was one of the larger relative detractors from performance during the quarter due to its strong performance and comparatively greater index weight.\u201d\n\n6. iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (BATS:IEO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 79.11%\n\nThe iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (BATS:IEO) aims to reflect the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration & Production Index, which consists of US stocks in the oil and gas exploration and production sector.

The company has an extensive resource base of high-quality drilling inventory in the U.S. and various international locations as well as a growing liquified natural gas business. In our view, the depth and quality of ConocoPhillips\u2019s inventory is a competitive differentiator that is not fully captured in today\u2019s share price. Over the next 10 years, we believe ConocoPhillips will be able to return more than 100% of its current market cap to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases while growing its production at a mid-single-digit annual pace. We believe ConocoPhillips is also among the best managed companies in the oil and gas industry and we are impressed by its history of accretive capital allocation under CEO Ryan Lance. The stock has meaningfully underperformed the broader market year-to-date and is an attractive addition to our portfolio.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Diversified Stock Portfolio: 5 Sector ETFs and International ETFs To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Now 11 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now 11 Oversold Biotech Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? Buy ASML Stock Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's artificial intelligence (AI)-powered surge has sent its valuation to incredible levels, putting the chipmaker well out of reach of value investors looking to capitalize on the proliferation of this technology.\n\nNvidia's sales multiple of 36 and trailing earnings multiple of 73 are significantly higher than the technology sector's price-to-sales ratio of 7.2 and earnings multiple of 45. Of course, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 35 indicates that the semiconductor bellwether is on track to deliver terrific growth and could justify its expensive valuation.\n\nBut there is also a relatively inexpensive way for investors to ride the AI boom. Dutch semiconductor equipment company ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) is not only cheaper than Nvidia, but it is also playing a critical role in the growth of AI. Let's look at the reasons why investors who have missed Nvidia's stunning rally over the past year would do well to buy ASML right now.\n\nAI is set to drive solid growth for ASML Holding\n\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) play a central role in training large language models, but making those GPUs wouldn't have been possible without ASML's machines. More specifically, Nvidia's flagship H100 AI GPU is manufactured using a custom 5-nanometer process node from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC.\n\nHowever, TSMC can only manufacture these 5nm chips using ASML's machines. As it turns out, any semiconductor foundry that's looking to manufacture advanced chips made on process nodes that are 7nm or smaller will have to turn to ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. That's because ASML has a monopoly on the market for EUV lithography machines.\n\nThis puts the company in a solid position to make the most of the increasing demand for the advanced chipmaking equipment that will be needed to manufacture AI chips. According to third-party estimates, the EUV lithography market could clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% through 2032, generating $63 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period. The overall semiconductor equipment market, meanwhile, is expected to generate a whopping $222 billion in revenue in 2032, up from $83 billion in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML's massive order backlog makes it clear that it is well on its way to making the most of this multibillion-dollar opportunity. The company finished 2023 with a backlog of 39 billion euros. This impressive backlog was driven by a sharp jump in ASML's bookings last quarter. More specifically, ASML recorded net bookings of 9.2 billion euros in the fourth quarter of 2023, a big jump over the 2.6 billion euros worth of bookings it received in the third quarter.\n\nThe company saw a sharp jump in orders last year, with its net bookings increasing by more than 50% to 30.7 billion euros from 20 billion euros in 2022. It is worth noting that 60% of the orders ASML received in the previous quarter were for EUV systems. That wasn't surprising, as chipmakers are scrambling to place orders for ASML's systems so that they can manufacture AI chips.\n\nThe company's robust order backlog is the reason why it is predicted to deliver robust growth over the next couple of years. ASML Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe stock's attractive valuation and potential growth make it a solid investment\n\nASML's healthy top-line growth explains why its earnings are predicted to increase at an annual rate of 22% for the next five years. Based on its 2023 earnings of $21.78 per share, ASML's bottom line could jump to just under $59 per share in 2028.\n\nUsing the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 31 as a proxy for tech stocks and multiplying it by ASML's projected earnings after five years points toward a stock price of $1,829. That would be a 90% increase from current levels. ASML currently trades at 46 times trailing earnings and 13 times sales, so it is significantly cheaper than Nvidia. This makes ASML an ideal bet for investors looking for a cheaper AI alternative to Nvidia, and they would do well to buy it before it soars further following 27% gains in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "March Market Madness: 3 Stocks That Are a Slam-Dunk for Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Today\u2019s article takes us beyond basketball to introduce three stocks to buy in March. Forget buzzer-beaters and brackets, this March Madness is all about empowering your portfolio with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe global AI market is poised for significant growth, driven by its expanding applications across various industries. Forecasts indicate a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3%, reaching a market size of nearly $2 trillion by 2030. Now, savvy investors are looking for slam-dunk stocks that capitalize on this explosive growth.\n\nBut here\u2019s the secret: You don\u2019t need to chase the usual AI giants. Today, we\u2019ll unveil three underappreciated names quietly benefiting from the proliferation of AI in their specific niches. These three stocks to buy offer the potential for robust returns as AI reshapes the world around us.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelestica (CLS) The fiber laser cutting machine cutting the sheet metal plate with the sparking light.Hi-technology manufacturing concept.\n\nSource: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong our first stocks to buy is Celestica (NASDAQ:CLS), a leading electronics manufacturing services (EMS) company that builds custom hardware for clients across industries. Celestica released solid fourth-quarter and full-year financial results in late January. Revenue increased 5% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.14 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 36% to 76 cents. That positive performance was driven by the Connectivity & Cloud Solutions segment, with significant demand for bespoke hardware solutions from hyperscaler clients.\n\nCelestica\u2019s strategic investments in AI, machine learning and cloud solutions have positioned it as a leader in the EMS space. In fact, management forecasts continued momentum in 2024. Robust revenue growth and improved product mix are expected to be the main drivers of future growth.\n\nAs a result, CLS stock has gained more than 55% year-to-date (YTD), on top of a 150% increase in 2023. Despite this impressive run, shares are trading below sector median multiples at 15.2 times adjusted forward earnings and 0.7 times trailing sales. Long-term investors may regard a potential decline in the CLS stock price as an opportunity to invest in the booming AI hardware market.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nIT heavyweight Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is a top contender in our March slam dunk stocks to buy list. Its focus on AI and on-premise deployments positions it well within the rapidly growing AI server market, projected to balloon to $150 billion by 2027.\n\nDell recently released robust earnings, with EPS exceeding analyst expectations by a robust 22% YOY, despite a slight dip in overall revenue. Yet, the deferred revenue reached $30.3 billion, reflecting strong customer commitments. The metrics announced highlight the strength of their AI strategy. Currently, Dell offers a comprehensive AI server portfolio for the demanding workloads of advanced AI applications like machine learning and natural language processing. Management also recognizes the growing importance of multi-cloud and edge-computing\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: despite a 40% YTD surge, DELL stock still trades at a favorable valuation \u2014 14.4 times forward earnings and 1.0 times trailing sales. Plus, Dell\u2019s board just increased the dividend by 20% and committed to 10% annual hikes through 2028, making it a solid income earner. Analysts project a price target of $125, suggesting a 17% upside potential.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nDon\u2019t want to pick individual AI winners? No problem! Rounding out our March \u201cstocks to buy\u201d list is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH).\u00a0This exchange-traded fund (ETF) offers a one-stop shop for exposure to the booming AI chip market.\n\nSMH started trading on Dec 20, 2011, and currently has 26 holdings. The top 10 stocks comprise close to 74% of its $19.15 billion net assets, making it a concentrated fund. The leading 5 names in the fund include semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), followed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Netherlands-based ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), all crucial for developing the next generation of AI technology.\n\nWith AI rapidly transforming industries, the demand for powerful AI chips is expected to skyrocket. VanEck recognizes this potential, highlighting strong growth indicators for the sector in 2024 and beyond.\n\nSMH boasts a solid track record, having returned 30% YTD and 81% over the past year. Plus, it offers a .48% dividend yield. Keep in mind the expense ratio is 0.35%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil \u200bh\u200bolds both long and short positions in \u200bN\u200bVDA stock.

        "title": "Forget Magnificent Seven: Jim Cramer Likes These \u2018Super 7\u2019 European Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at some European stocks liked by Jim Cramer. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article\u00a0Jim Cramer Likes These Super 3 European Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer said in one of his latest programs on CNBC that the US stock market isn\u2019t the only one with the \u201cbreadth\u201d problem, referring to the phenomenon where most of the stock market gains last year came from a handful of mega-cap tech stocks or Magnificent Seven stocks which include companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG). Cramer said that the concentration of stock market gains is much higher in the European stock market. Cramer shared some data to back this point which was published by Citi\u2019s equity research team led by Dr. Beata Manthey. He said that in January and February this year, just five stocks in Europe accounted for about 45% of the total gains of MSCI Europe Index.\n\nJim Cramer Shares a New \"Shopping List\" of Stocks for 2024\n\nJim Cramer said that analysts at Citi recently ran a screen for mega-cap European stocks with characteristics similar to Magnificent Seven stocks in the US: high earnings growth, solid margins and strong economic moat. Cramer said Citi analysts believe these stocks have lower valuations when compared to their US counterparts and have more room to run in the future. As you will see later in this article, Cramer also believes several of these seven stocks in Europe have a lot of growth potential.\n\nJim Cramer said that Citi\u2019s Super Seven list \u201cmakes for a great list of companies.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jim Cramer did emphasize that he cannot recommend investors to start piling into these stocks immediately since most of them are trading at their all-time highs. Cramer said that it would make him look a \u201clittle crazy\u201d to recommend stocks that already had a \u201chuge run.\u201d But Jim Cramer urged his viewers to see these companies as a \u201cshopping list\u201d of high quality stocks that \u201ccould be very attractive\u201d on pullback.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Likes These Super 7 European Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched Jim Cramer's recent program on CNBC in which he walked his viewers through Citi's Dr. Beata Manthey's Super Seven European stocks and shared his bullish thoughts on these companies. Cramer thinks these stocks should be bought on a pullback.\n\n7. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO)\n\nJim Cramer recently quoted Citi and said the \u201cleader\u201d of the Super Seven group of stocks is Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). Cramer said it\u2019s \u201cobvious\u201d that the pharmaceutical company is the leader of the group. Cramer said Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) was the company which originally came up with GLP-1 drugs for diabetes. He said Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is \u201cyears ahead\u201d of his American favorite weight loss stock Eli Lilly. Jim Cramer said that recently it was revealed that the GLP-1 pill Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is developing could be much more effective than the one being developed by Eli Lilly. Jim Cramer also highlighted the FDA\u2019s recent approval for Novo Nordisk's (NYSE:NVO) drug for heart disease. Earlier this month, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) said the FDA approved its weight-loss drug Wegovy for the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in overweight or obese people with established cardiovascular disease.\n\nCramer said that it \u201ccan\u2019t go wrong with either of these stocks\u201d as he believes more Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk\u00a0(NYSE:NVO)\u00a0has more room for growth.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAs we discussed in last quarter\u2019s commentary,\u00a0Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a newer addition to the strategy. Over the fourth quarter, we continued to build the position to an average weight. As a reminder, Novo Nordisk is a global pharmaceutical company based in Denmark and has long been the leader in developing insulin for diabetes patients. In recent years, the company\u2019s innovation into GLP-1 drugs has been shown not only to help diabetics control blood sugar levels but also to have significant efficacy in weight loss. Obesity has become a global epidemic, creating materially negative knock-on effects for humans that range from an increase in cardiovascular events and, thus, higher mortality to a lower general quality of life. We believe that, over time, payors will recognize the value of these obesity treatments to both patients and the overall healthcare system.\u201d\n\n6. ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the European stocks in the Super Seven group recommended by Citi and liked by Jim Cramer. Jim Cramer said ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) is operating in the semiconductor equipment sector where there\u2019s limited competition and ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) remains \u201cunrivaled.\u201d Cramer said that ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) has a \u201cmonopoly\u201d in making equipment that is required to make advanced semiconductor chips.\n\nJim Cramer also highlighted ASML Holding N.V's (NASDAQ:ASML) excellent stock performance, since the stock is up 58% over the past one year and 33% in 2024 through March 14. ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) stock has been roaring after ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) posted a blockbuster quarterly report in January. Cramer seemed especially excited about ASML Holding N.V's (NASDAQ:ASML) net bookings which came in at a whopping \u00a0\u20ac9.2 billion, compared to the Street\u2019s estimate of just \u20ac3.57 billion.\n\nIn addition to ASML, Jim Cramer likes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNetherlands-based\u00a0ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world\u2019s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.\u201d\n\n5. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY)\n\nLVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is another important member of the Super Seven group of European stocks. Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is very \u201cexciting\u201d for \u201ca lot of people out there.\u201d Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is the largest luxury conglomerate in the world. Cramer named some of the top brands of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) which include Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Givenchy, Dior, Fendi, among many others.\n\nJim Cramer said that one of the strengths of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is its target market \u2014 the rich. Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) posted a \u201cblowout\u201d quarter in January and the stock has been a \u201cphenomenal\u201d performer. He believes LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) stock can \u201ckeep winning\u201d but recommended investors to wait for a pullback to buy it.\n\nHere is what\u00a0 Distillate Capital has to say about LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2013 Louis Vuitton, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (NYSE:LVMUY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAfter rebalancing, Distillate\u2019s International FSV strategy offers a higher free cash flow yield both to market cap and enterprise value, and has substantially more stable fundamentals and less leverage than the index. The largest new position is\u00a0LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy \u2013 Louis Vuitton, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (NYSE:LVMUY), where estimated free cash \u03f2ows are up year-to-date while the stock is down.\u201d\n\n4. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)\n\nNext on the list of the Super Seven group of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about is SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), the Germany-based software company. Cramer said SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) \u201ctook its time\u201d to adjust to the \u201cnew world\u201d of Cloud computing but eventually caught up and now it\u2019s making \u201cbig money\u201d off of artificial intelligence. Jim Cramer praised the stock\u2019s run over the past several months (it\u2019s up about 64% over the past one year) and said it\u2019s \u201cprobably not done.\u201d Cramer also said that he \u201cshould have caught it\u201d but he was focusing more on ServiceNow. Cramer is also bullish on other AI stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP). The biggest stakeholder of SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) during this period was Ken Fisher which had an $820 million stake in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP).\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cLike Workday and Amazon,\u00a0SAP SE\u2019s (NYSE:SAP) stock price rose significantly in Q4 after the company reported its Q3 2023 earnings. Importantly, SAP\u2019s transition to the cloud (a core part of our thesis on the business) continues at pace, and the company is seeing both robust cloud revenue growth and expanding cloud gross margins. Management is guiding cloud sales growth through 2025 in the mid-20% range, which we view as reasonable and attractive.\n\nWe also view SAP as one of the more resilient software business models as it is an essential part of its customers\u2019 day-to-day operations and cannot easily be turned off or scaled back.\u201d\n\nTo see rest of the stocks in this list click Jim Cramer Likes These \u2018Super 3\u2019 European Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best March Dividend Stocks To Buy Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates' Top 15 Dividend Stocks 15 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett\n\nDisclosure.

If you want to skip our discussion on the semiconductor industry, head over to 5 Best Semiconductor ETFs.\n\nIn 2023, the semiconductor industry faced numerous challenges, including inflation, geopolitical uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, and decreased demand in PC and mobile device markets, leading to an 8.2% global revenue decline compared to the previous year. However, despite some persistent challenges, the industry's overall outlook for 2024 is positive, with expectations of double-digit revenue growth. KPMG'sannual survey gathered insights from 172 semiconductor executives globally. Despite the revenue contraction in 2023, 83% of respondents anticipate increased revenue growth for their companies in 2024. Additionally, 85% believe the industry as a whole will experience growth, a significant increase from the previous year's survey.\n\nSeveral positive factors are expected to drive growth in 2024, including trends in generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), cloud computing, increased semiconductor usage in automobiles, and expanding aerospace and defense budgets, which could mitigate broader economic and geopolitical risks. While 30% of semiconductor leaders perceive an excess of inventory, up from 24% last year, 19% anticipate increasing demand due to AI and emerging technologies, double the 2023 figure. Overall, 2024 is viewed as the start of another cyclical upswing for the semiconductor industry.\n\nAlso Read: ETFs in an Emerging Market: 10 Best ETFs To Buy\n\nDeloittereported that the semiconductor industry in 2023 faced its seventh downturn since 1990. However, projections for 2024 suggest a recovery, with global sales forecasted to reach $588 billion, marking a 13% improvement over 2023 and a 2.5% increase from the record revenues of $574 billion in 2022. The memory chip market played a significant role in the industry's performance last year, experiencing a sharp decline of around 31%, or approximately $40 billion. However, it is expected to rebound in 2024, approaching 2022 levels. Excluding memory, the rest of the industry saw a more moderate decline of about 3% in 2023. In terms of end markets, both PC and smartphone sales are projected to grow by 4% in 2024, following declines of 14% and 3.5%, respectively, in 2023. The recovery of these key markets is crucial for the semiconductor industry, as communication and computer chip sales, including data center chips, accounted for 56% of total semiconductor sales in 2022. However, inventory levels remained high at over $60 billion in fall 2023, posing a challenge for sales in the first half of 2024 as efforts to reduce inventory continue. Additionally, fab utilization, which reached levels around the mid-90% range during the recent shortage, is expected to decline below 70% in Q4 2023. Higher utilization rates are necessary for industry profitability, suggesting a prolonged recovery period may be required.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee also: 11 Best Vanguard ETFs For 2024\n\nHeading into 2024, the semiconductor industry is poised for a notable recovery following the challenges of Q3 2023. Analysts at International Data Corporation (IDC)foresee a considerable growth opportunity in 2024. This optimistic outlook marks a welcome departure from the recent fluctuations and is fueled by several key trends. Firstly, the demand for AI chips continues to rise steadily. These chips play a critical role in powering a diverse range of advanced technologies and services. As AI integration expands across different sectors, including big data and smart devices, there is potential for a significant surge in demand for these chips. Secondly, the smartphone market is experiencing a resurgence, partly due to advancements such as 5G and new AI capabilities. This revitalization represents a significant boost for the semiconductor industry, as smartphones remain major consumers of semiconductor chips. Lastly, the automotive sector is increasingly reliant on semiconductor technology. Advancements in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and enhanced infotainment systems are making cars more technology-driven. This transformation is generating substantial demand for automotive semiconductors.\n\nSome of the best semiconductor stocks to buy include ASML Holding N.V.

Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 13.90 million shares worth $6.8 billion.\n\nSaltLight Capital stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to have some exposure to some of the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 \u2013 Amazon, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms and Google (although in aggregate, we still hold a smaller weighting than the S&P 500).\n\nWhile we are cautious in AI infrastructure, we do think there are mispriced opportunities in areas of application software where AI can be infused to make a step change improvement. Posted in our office is this chart that ASML provides at each of its investor days. This chart is a little outdated from 2021, but we think illustrates how value (in operating profit) was distributed across semiconductors, hardware, and then software & services. It\u2019s very clear that most of the economic value in the past has accrued to the software services (in gray) built on the backs of highly technical companies run by extremely smart people.\n\nWhy is this? We think it is due to a combination of distribution and network effects. Our working hypothesis right now is that this will likely remain a similar outcome in the AI epoch. One outlier right now is Nvidia which is capturing 80% margins..\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n9. Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXQ)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 13: 55.80%\n\nInvesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXQ) is linked to the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, aiming to invest at least 90% of its assets in index securities.

Analysts predict even higher revenue, estimating $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from the MI300.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 120 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 110 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 28.3 million shares worth $4.17 billion.\n\nIn addition to ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best semiconductor plays.\n\nJackson Peak Capital stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOn the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we\u2019ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it\u2019s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the \u201cboots on the ground\u201d winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We\u2019ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we\u2019re trying to \u201clet winners run\u201d while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.\u201d\n\n8. Columbia Seligman Semiconductor & Technology ETF (NYSE:SEMI)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 13: 70.67%\n\nColumbia Seligman Semiconductor & Technology ETF (NYSE:SEMI) primarily invests at least 80% of its assets in semiconductor, semiconductor equipment, and related technology companies, regardless of their size. It may include small and mid-cap companies and is considered non-diversified. Columbia Seligman Semiconductor & Technology ETF (NYSE:SEMI)\u2019s portfolio consists of 36 stocks and its net expense ratio is 0.75% as of March 1, 2024. Columbia Seligman Semiconductor & Technology ETF (NYSE:SEMI) is one of the best semiconductor ETFs to buy.\n\nLam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is the largest holding of Columbia Seligman Semiconductor & Technology ETF (NYSE:SEMI). Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) manufactures semiconductor processing equipment used in integrated circuit fabrication. On February 8, Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) declared a $2.00 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 3, to shareholders on record as of March 13.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 67 hedge funds were bullish on Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), compared to 74 funds in the last quarter.\n\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cLam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a leading global supplier of wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) and services to the semiconductor industry. Lam\u2019s products tend to focus on etch and deposition process steps and its tools are critical in the production of NAND and DRAM memory chips as well as logic devices. While the share of overall WFE spending looks relatively fragmented across the top four to five players in the industry, each of these leading companies tends to have significant share within smaller slices of the industry, creating a stable and favorable industry structure, with share shifts tending to only happen at times of technology transition in the broader industry. We purchased shares of Lam in the quarter as we believe we are at one of those key transition points in the industry that will disproportionately benefit Lam, with a move to gate-all-around transistors in logic creating an increasing need for complex deposition and etch process stops and the emergence of high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging requiring increasingly complex high-aspect-ratio (i.e., very deep) etches, where Lam has virtually 100% market share. We also believe the market is underestimating the pent-up earnings power in the company as NAND WFE spending recovers in the coming years from one of its worst down cycles ever in 2023.\u201d\n\n7.

        "content": "With artificial-intelligence-related semiconductor stocks flying into low-earth orbit, you may be left wondering if there are alternative opportunities in the space. There are \u2013 and they enjoy the highest level of endorsement among Wall Street analysts.\n\nWe must start, though, with a word of caution. Thanks to the stratospheric rise of companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the fervor has dramatically lifted all boats. Therefore, many semiconductor stocks will likely require forward-looking price adjustments. Right now, a good chunk of the top players have already exceeded prior average expectations.\n\nStill, with so much interest in the burgeoning ecosystem, you may be enticed to take a risk. If that\u2019s you, here are the strong buy semiconductor stocks to put on your short list.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is the world\u2019s second-most valuable semiconductor company, per its public profile. Further, it\u2019s the world\u2019s largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry. Because of its pertinence to the global computer chip supply chain, it commands huge geopolitical implications.\n\nUnsurprisingly, TSM stock has been on a strong run this year, gaining 44% of equity value since the January opener. Per covering analysts, they anticipate revenue this fiscal year to come in at $84.86 billion. If so, that would represent a 22% lift from last year\u2019s print of $69.4 billion.\n\nEven better, they view 2025 revenue hitting $101.38 billion. That would be a massive 19.7% leap from 2024\u2019s projected top line. For 2024 and 2025, earnings per share may reach $5.75 and $7.03, respectively.\n\nLastly, the experts rate TSM shares as a unanimous strong buy. Notably, the highest price target of $185 implies upside potential of more than 26%. Therefore, it\u2019s one of the semiconductor stocks to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nSpecialized equipment and services firm ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) easily ranks among the top semiconductor stocks to consider if you\u2019re looking for highly endorsed enterprises. It might not be a household name in the traditional sense. However, it\u2019s the leading supplier of photolithography systems, which are essential for the production of integrated circuits (ICs) and microchips.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal with ASML stock: since the start of the year, it\u2019s already enjoyed a robust performance. So, some concerns exist about betting on the entity now. Further, analysts project that by the end of this fiscal year, sales will land at $30.42 billion. That\u2019s less than 1% higher than last year\u2019s print of $30.18 billion.\n\nAt the same time, the experts believe 2025 sales will hit $37.91 billion, which would be a 24.6% leap from 2024\u2019s projected top line. Also, it\u2019s important to emphasize how critical ASML is to the broader semiconductor supply chain.\n\nAnalysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a high-side target of $1,050.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBased in Switzerland, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) is a multinational semiconductor company that designs, manufactures and sells semiconductor products used in various electronic applications. Primarily, the company focuses on microcontrollers or small computing devices used to control various functions in electronic systems. As well, it features relevancies in analog integrated circuits (ICs) or components that process continuous signals (i.e. sound, temperature, etc.) and converting them into digital data.\n\nStated differently, there\u2019s a very high chance that you\u2019re using STMicroelectronics\u2019 various innovations without actively knowing about it. Many of the company\u2019s products are integrated into everyday products and systems: smartphones, automotive systems, home appliances, industrial equipment and more.\n\nAdmittedly, the forward-looking framework is a bit questionable. Analysts project 2024 sales to land at $16.17 billion, which is 6.4% below last year\u2019s tally. However, they also anticipate 2025 sales to reach $17.56 billion by 2025.\n\nOverall, covering experts rate STM a strong buy with a $48.40 price target. The high-side estimate calls for $55 per share. It\u2019s one of the semiconductor stocks to consider for the long haul.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Toby Sterling\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A crisis meeting between top executives of ASML and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte led to the CEO of the Netherlands' largest company ruling out quitting the country but failed to resolve issues surrounding its future growth plans.\n\nAs chipmakers around the globe pour billions of dollars into setting up new plants to cope with soaring demand, ASML, their largest supplier, has said it will need to roughly double the size of its operations in the coming decade, but faces challenges in doing so at home.\n\n\"There is a considerable gap between the concerns of industry, and what we think is necessary, and what politicians think,\" ASML CEO Peter Wennink told reporters after Wednesday's meeting in Rutte's office.\n\nIf ASML cannot grow in the Netherlands \"it can do so elsewhere\", he said.\n\nASML employs 42,000 staff worldwide, half of them in the area around its headquarters in Veldhoven, Netherlands, where its machines are designed and assembled.\n\nAttracting scarce foreign engineering talent to the Netherlands is a major issue. Others include difficulty obtaining building permits, constraints on the Dutch electrical grid, transportation bottlenecks and ensuring that there are plans in place for hospitals, schools, and housing to accommodate growth.\n\nIt emerged on Wednesday that Rutte's Cabinet has launched a campaign dubbed \"Operation Beethoven\" to try to address the company's concerns, having seen multinationals Shell and Unilever depart the Netherlands in recent years.\n\nHowever, difficulties around staffing cannot fully be resolved by talks with Rutte's government, which is in a caretaker role following 2023 elections that saw anti-immigration parties book major gains.\n\nWhile populist lawmaker Geert Wilders is negotiating a new right-wing government, parliament has approved motions to cap the number of foreign students allowed into Dutch universities and scrap a tax break for skilled migrant workers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnding that tax break in particular has met with criticism from ASML, industry groups, staffing experts, and many Dutch tech employers, including chipmaker NXP. More than 40% of ASML employees in the Netherlands are not Dutch.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's meeting, Economy Minister Micky Adriaansens told reporters the caretaker Cabinet is now trying to \"look at alternatives that do less pain.\"\n\nIt is not clear whether a tax break for foreigners, highly unpopular with Dutch voters, could be restored.\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling;Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",

        "title": "US Urges Allies to Squeeze China Further on Chip Technology",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US government is pressing allies including the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea and Japan to further tighten restrictions on China\u2019s access to semiconductor technology, a controversial effort that\u2019s drawing resistance in some countries, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOlivia Rodrigo Is Not Kid-Friendly? Don't Act Surprised. Egypt\u2019s Devaluation and Record Rate Hike Put IMF Deal in Reach Nikki Haley Ends 2024 Bid, Setting Up Trump-Biden Rematch Chemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Trump, Biden Ride Super Tuesday Wins to Rematch Few Want\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s latest push is aimed at plugging holes in export controls it\u2019s levied over the past two years and restraining China\u2019s progress in developing domestic chip capabilities, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. For example, the US is urging the Netherlands to stop ASML Holding NV from servicing and repairing sensitive chipmaking equipment that Chinese clients purchased before limits on sales of those devices were put into place this year, said the people.\n\nThe US also wants Japanese companies to limit exports to China of specialized chemicals critical for chipmaking, including photoresist, they said. Japan is home to several leaders in photoresist, including JSR Corp. and Shin-Etsu Chemical Co.\n\nTokyo and The Hague have responded coolly to Washington\u2019s latest push, arguing that they want to assess the impact of their current curbs before considering tighter measures, some of the people said. US Commerce Department officials raised the issue in Tokyo during a meeting on export controls last month, according to one of the people.\n\nRepresentatives at ASML, the Dutch trade ministry and Japan\u2019s Ministry for Economy, Trade and Industry declined to comment. In Washington, the National Security Council and the US Commerce Department also declined to comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Biden administration has taken aim at China\u2019s semiconductor industry since 2022, imposing sweeping controls on the export of advanced chip-making machines and sophisticated chips like those used to develop artificial intelligence. Japan and the Netherlands, the two key countries where chip-making equipment is developed, joined the US effort last year.\n\nBut holes still remain, particularly in the ability of Japanese and Dutch engineers to continue doing some equipment repairs, and in the flow of spare parts that are used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\n\nUS officials got a shock last August when China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co. unveiled a smartphone powered by a homemade chip that is more than a generation ahead of where the US had sought to halt the Asian country\u2019s progress.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has vowed to take the \u201cstrongest possible\u201d action following the Huawei breakthrough, while Republican lawmakers have called for a complete block of Huawei and its chipmaking partner Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.\u2019s access to US technology.\n\nThe latest US push includes an effort to tighten existing limits. ASML needs a license to service and repair restricted gear in China, but the Netherlands has been somewhat lax about approval, according to one of the people. The US wants the Netherlands to take a more stringent approach, the person said.\n\nThe US also wants to draw more countries into its export-control blockade. The Biden administration is trying to bring Germany and South Korea into an agreement that already includes Japan and the Netherlands, since all four countries are home to key firms in the semiconductor supply chain, according to the people.\n\nFor Germany, one of the critical players is Carl Zeiss AG, a specialized glass maker that supplies ASML with the optical components necessary for advanced chip production. The US wants Germany to get Zeiss to pull back from shipping such components to China, the people said.\n\nDutch officials also hope that Germany will join the export control group, according to the people, and the Biden administration is pushing for an agreement before the G7 summit in June. Berlin last year mulled over whether to restrict exports of chip chemicals to China, but Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is slated to visit China in April, has not yet taken a stance on the issue, according to the person. Scholz\u2019s deputy Robert Habeck, meanwhile, is visiting the US this week and will meet Raimondo during his trip.\n\nIn addition, the US has held talks with South Korea on chip export controls, given the country\u2019s leading role in producing chips and supplying spare parts for chip-making equipment. The two countries launched a structured dialogue in February after US officials asked their counterparts in Seoul to join the multilateral group last year, according to some of the people.\n\n--With assistance from Yuki Furukawa, Takashi Mochizuki, Yoolim Lee, Kamil Kowalcze and Jennifer Jacobs.\n\n(Updates with Commerce Department response in fifth paragraph.

        "content": "(Adds remarks from economy minister in paragraphs 3-4, remarks from ASML CEO in 7-8, changes dateline from Amsterdam)\n\nBy Toby Sterling\n\nTHE HAGUE, March 6 (Reuters) - The Dutch government is talking with semiconductor equipment maker ASML to ensure that the Netherlands' largest company does not move to another country, or expand abroad, due to anti-immigration policies, the economy minister said.\n\nThe news was first reported by newspaper De Telegraaf, which cited anonymous sources and said the ministries involved had dubbed the effort \"Operation Beethoven\".\n\nEconomic Affairs Minister Micky Adriaansens would not address all aspects of the paper's report but in an interview with Reuters she confirmed that she was meeting ASML CEO Peter Wennink in The Hague on Wednesday as part of what she said were ongoing talks.\n\n\"I don't know if they would leave\" the Netherlands, she said. \"They want to grow. And they want to grow in such an amount, it puts a pressure on our infrastructure.\"\n\n\"That's why we're talking to them very intensively. Because we want to understand, is it something we can solve?\"\n\nThe report follows comments made by ASML CEO Peter Wennink in January when he warned that his company was highly reliant on skilled foreign labour, after anti-immigration parties booked big gains in 2023 elections.\n\nASML declined to comment on Wednesday. However, Wennink spoke at an event in The Hague and said he was concerned the business climate in the Netherlands was worsening.\n\n\"Some of these elements that made us a great company, those elements are under pressure,\" he said, citing increasing regulation and a plan to scrap a tax break given to highly skilled immigrants.\n\nPOTENTIAL CURBS ON FOREIGN STUDENTS\n\nAround 40% of ASML's 23,000 employees in the Netherlands are not Dutch. Europe's largest tech company sources parts from around the globe but currently assembles its machines in Veldhoven, Netherlands before shipping them to major computer chipmakers.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML dominates the market for lithography systems, used to help create the circuitry of chips. It is currently conducting one round of expansion and expects to need more in the coming years as the global demand for chips increases.\n\nMultinationals Shell and Unilever departed the Netherlands in recent years following an unfavourable change in Dutch tax law.\n\nAnother policy under consideration by parties attempting to form a right wing government following the election is to limit the number of foreign students that can attend Dutch universities - a key source of labour for the country's tech firms.\n\n\"The consequences of limiting labour migration are large, we need those people to innovate,\" Wennink said in January. \"If we can't get those people here, we will go somewhere where we can grow.\"\n\nThough it would be difficult for the company to move its headquarters, De Telegraaf mentioned France as a possible destination for a company expansion, citing a single source.\n\nChipmakers across the globe are pouring billions of dollars in investment to set up new plants, encouraged by the rising use of semiconductors in everyday devices and generous subsidies from the United States and the EU aimed at keeping the West ahead of China in the race for cutting-edge technology.\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

        "title": "SMH vs. XSD: Which Semiconductor ETF Is the Better Buy?",
        "content": "The semiconductor sector has been outperforming many others in the market and shows few signs of slowing down. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs to see which is the better choice for investors \u2014 the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) or the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:XSD).\n\nWhile these are both great ETFs that invest in semiconductor stocks, they differ quite a bit in several key ways, which we\u2019ll explore in this article.\n\nWhat Is the SMH ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nAccording to VanEck, SMH \u201cseeks to replicate\u2026 the price and yield performance of the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index (MVSMHTR), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment.\u201d\n\nVanEck explains, \u201cRather than attempting to pick individual stock winners in this ever-evolving sector, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF provides exposure to the top 25 most liquid U.S.-listed semiconductor companies, spanning the entire industry value chain from chip design and fabrication to manufacturing machinery.\u201d\n\nWhat Is the XSD ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nXSD seeks to give investors exposure to the semiconductor sector of the S&P Total Market Index (TMI) by investing in the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index.\n\nThe key difference between XSD and SMH is that this is a \u201cmodified equal weighted index which provides the potential for unconcentrated industry exposure across large, mid and small cap stocks.\u201d We\u2019ll discuss this further when we compare the funds\u2019 holdings.\n\nPortfolio Comparison\n\nSMH is index-weighted. It owns 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for over three-quarters of its assets.\n\nBelow is an overview of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nOn the other hand, XSD uses a modified equal-weighted approach, so it is much less concentrated. It owns 40 stocks, and its top 10 positions make up just 33.5% of the fund.\u00a0Below is an overview of XSD\u2019s top 10 holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou\u2019ll immediately notice that these different strategies result in very different-looking portfolios, even though these are both semiconductor ETFs. Right away, you\u2019ll see that Nvidia is the top holding for both funds, but it makes up over one-quarter of SMH\u2019s assets while it accounts for a smaller, more manageable 4.2% of XSD\u2019s assets.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing for SMH. The generative AI leader has skyrocketed to a 235% gain over the past year, so SMH has benefited from this significant exposure, as it has propelled the ETF to significant gains. On the other hand, you can also make the case that XSD\u2019s smaller, more manageable position gives it less exposure to risk if Nvidia shares pull back.\n\nBeyond weightings, the funds also differ in another key way.\n\nAs discussed above, SMH\u2019s investments in the semiconductor space span \u201cthe entire industry value chain from chip design and fabrication to manufacturing machinery.\u201d This means that SMH invests in the companies that fabricate semiconductors, like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), as well as the companies that make the equipment used in the semiconductor fabrication process, like Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML).\n\nNotably, while XSD is nominally more diversified than SMH in that it holds fewer stocks and is less concentrated, this segment of the semiconductor supply chain is conspicuously absent from its portfolio, meaning that it is not as diversified as SMH in this regard.\n\nTo me, this gives SMH a clear edge over XSD in terms of who has the better portfolio. This is a bit of a shame for XSD because these are great companies that are generating stellar returns for their shareholders. For example, Applied Materials is up 83.2% over the past year, while Lam Research is up 96.9%. Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML are up 51.9% and 51.1%, respectively.\n\nThese semiconductor equipment companies are also highly rated by TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML Holding receive \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 Smart Scores, while Lam Research receives a 9. Applied Materials receives a Neutral-equivalent Smart Score of 7.\n\nOverall, eight out of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or higher, while seven of XSD\u2019s top 10 holdings do.\u00a0SMH receives an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8, while XSD receives a Neutral-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 7.\n\nBased on these Smart Scores and the absence of chipmakers and equipment makers from XSD\u2019s portfolio, I\u2019m giving SMH the distinctive edge in terms of portfolio composition.\n\nHead-to-Head Performance\n\nSMH has also outperformed XSD over the years when it comes to the investment returns that it has generated.\u00a0As of January 31, SMH has soundly beaten XSD over the past three years, with a three-year annualized return of 18.8% versus XSD\u2019s three-year return of just 5.8%. Over the past five years, SMH has also beaten XSD with an annualized return of 32.1% versus a 24.5% annualized return for XSD. To be clear, these are both very good returns, but SMH\u2019s are markedly better.\n\nLastly, over the past 10 years, the gap narrows a bit, but SMH\u2019s 26.1% annualized return still trumps XSD\u2019s 22.0% return.\n\nSome of the gap in recent years comes down to the scintillating performance of SMH\u2019s largest position, Nvidia. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and in the event of an Nvidia pullback, XSD could potentially outperform SMH in the future, but one would still have to give the edge to SMH in the performance category.\n\nIdentical Fees\n\nThese ETFs directly compete for customers and their investment dollars, so it is perhaps unsurprising that they feature identical expense ratios of 0.35%, making this category a tossup.\u00a0This means that an investor in either fund will pay $35 in fees annually on a $10,000 investment.\n\nIs SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $223.74 implies 8.0% upside potential from current levels.\n\nIs XSD Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, XSD earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 34 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average XSD stock price target of $256.65 implies 17.5% upside potential from current levels.\n\nInterestingly, sell-side analysts see more potential upside from XSD. This is likely because, after the massive run Nvidia has had, analysts expect more potential upside from some of the sector\u2019s laggards, which XSD is more allocated towards.\n\nAdding It All Up\n\nIn reality, these are both great ETFs that have generated significant returns for investors over a long period. I give the edge to SMH, as its portfolio looks stronger based on TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score and because its portfolio includes semiconductor fabrication and equipment stocks, which are unfortunately lacking from XSD\u2019s portfolio. Furthermore, SMH has been a stronger performer over the past three, five, and 10 years.\n\nIn my view, SMH is the hands-down winner based on these factors, but you can make the case for owning either ETF. For more conservative investors who don\u2019t feel comfortable having over 25% exposure to Nvidia and who are looking for a less concentrated way to approach the semiconductor space, XSD would likely be the way to go. Furthermore, if Nvidia slows down and some of the space\u2019s less-heralded stocks begin to catch up to it, XSD could outperform SMH.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "When Should You Buy ASML Holding N.V. (AMS:ASML)?",
        "content": "ASML Holding N.V. (AMS:ASML) saw a significant share price rise of 42% in the past couple of months on the ENXTAM. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on ASML Holding\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for ASML Holding\n\nIs ASML Holding Still Cheap?\n\nASML Holding appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 44.11x is currently well-above the industry average of 23.36x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since ASML Holding\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat does the future of ASML Holding look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 64% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ASML Holding. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ASML\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe ASML should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on ASML for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ASML, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in ASML Holding.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in ASML Holding, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Adds tech and industry context in paragraphs 4-7, spokesperson in para 8)\n\nAMSTERDAM, Feb 28 (Reuters) - ASML has reached \"first light\" on its massive new High NA EUV lithography system, the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker confirmed on Wednesday, a milestone that means the tool is functioning though not at full performance.\n\nThe head of technology development at Intel, Ann Kelleher, first mentioned the progress during a talk at the SPIE lithography conference on Tuesday in San Jose.\n\nASML confirmed Kelleher's remarks were accurate.\n\nLithography systems use focused light beams to help create the tiny circuitry of computer chips. ASML's High NA EUV tools, which are the size of a double decker bus and cost more than $350 million each, are expected to help enable new generations of smaller, faster chips.\n\nThe first High NA tool in existence is at ASML's laboratory in Veldhoven, Netherlands and the second is under assembly at an Intel plant near Hillsboro, Oregon.\n\nAdvanced chipmakers including TSMC and Samsung are expected to adopt the tool in the coming five years, with Intel saying at an event last week it intends to use the tool in production for its 14A generation of chips.\n\nIn Kelleher's talk she said that the Veldhoven machine has seen the \"first light on wafer in resist,\" meaning the machine has been used in a test on a silicon wafer that has been treated with light-sensitive chemicals so that it is ready to receive a circuit pattern.\n\nAn ASML spokesperson said the first light milestone had been reached \"very recently\".

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Multibagger Up 950% in the Last Decade That Is Secretly Powering the \"Magnificent Seven\"",
        "content": "Consisting of Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, the \"Magnificent Seven\" may be the most important stocks of this generation. After collectively rising 107% in 2023 -- and another 14% so far in 2024 -- each of these businesses now hold market capitalizations between $600 billion and $3.1 trillion.\n\nTo put this size in context, these stocks now account for roughly 30% of the S&P 500 index's total market cap of $44.5 trillion. Home to many bleeding-edge technologies in today's world, it is tough to argue that the Magnificent Seven doesn't deserve this massive allocation of funds.\n\nHowever, one company works behind the scenes to keep these juggernauts' operations humming: Netherlands-based ASML(NASDAQ: ASML). Playing a vital role in the semiconductor supply chain, ASML helps enable the Magnificent Seven's most ambitious technological aspirations.\n\nThanks to its unmatched technology, here's how ASML secretly powers the world's most influential companies -- potentially making it a more intriguing investment than its enormous peers. Image source: ASML.\n\nASML's dominant position in lithography\n\nASML maintains a monopoly in the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) market and controls around two-thirds of the more mature deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) niche. Lithography uses ultraviolet light to draw infinitesimal patterns onto silicon wafers. These wafers are then layered to build semiconductors, which help power smartphones, computers, data centers, cars, and AI language models.\n\nSeeing this array of end-product use cases, it isn't surprising that ASML's three largest customers are the semiconductor behemothsTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, and Samsung Electronics. These companies' products (requiring ASML's lithography) are vital to the innovation machines that comprise the Magnificent Seven.\n\nJust how important? Let's consider things through the lens of a snap test.\n\nStory continues\n\nA snap test and ASML's connection to the Magnificent Seven\n\nPopularized by Motley Fool's co-founder David Gardner, a \"snap\" test asks us to imagine a world where we snap our fingers and a company's products disappear. In ASML's case, many of today's advanced electronics would be much different or less sophisticated -- at a minimum. At worst, they may be nonexistent.\n\nHow is this so?\n\nFirst, ASML's largest customer, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), counts Apple as its biggest client. Via this trickle-down effect from ASML to TSMC to Apple, there is no doubt that Apple's consumer electronics would be entirely different without using ASML's lithography. Sans ASML's help, Apple's products might be physically larger, slower, less powerful, and have fewer features.\n\nMeanwhile, another of TSMC's largest customers is Nvidia, which relies upon the company to create chips for its graphic processing units (GPUs). These GPUs from Nvidia are then distributed to the rest of the Magnificent Seven, for use in:\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform and its artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions Amazon and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- as well as its AI endeavors Alphabet's Google cloud platform and its numerous AI concepts Meta's data centers and its AI product, LLaMa Tesla's full self-driving mode, which uses Nvidia chips to train its AI models for autonomous driving\n\nWhile it is virtually impossible to imagine the extent to which a world without ASML would change, it is clear that the Magnificent Seven would look dramatically different.\n\nASML is good for shareholders, too\n\nPosting a total return above 950% over the last decade, ASML is not only crucial to the world of advanced technology, but also shareholder-friendly.\n\nThanks to its dominant positioning in the lithography industry, ASML maintains an incredible net profit margin of 28%. The company has repurchased 1% of its shares annually since 2014, bolstered by this immense profitability while boosting its dividend payments ninefold. ASML Shares Outstanding data by YCharts\n\nWhile ASML may not match its 14% annualized revenue growth rate from the last decade over the next 10 years, it grew sales by 30% in 2023 and has clear megatrends working in its favor. Supported by growth drivers in end markets such as the ongoing energy transition, the \"electrification of everything,\" and AI, the semiconductor market should double within 10 years, according to ASML's CEO Peter Wennink.\n\nCommanding a lofty price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43 today, the market expects this steady growth to come to fruition, with ASML maintaining its leadership position for many years. Since ASML secretly powers the Magnificent Seven in many ways, yet trades at nearly twice the valuation of the S&P 500's average, dollar-cost-averaging buys would be prudent for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 17 European Countries that Allow Dual Citizenship. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 European Countries that Allow Dual Citizenship.\n\nInternational mobility is a coveted asset in contemporary times. A second passport can open doors to another country, providing various financial, cultural benefits, and freedom. Especially during times of uncertainty and unforeseen catastrophes, it can serve as a vital alternative security plan. A dual/multiple citizen is someone who holds legal citizenship in two countries simultaneously. This status entails both rights (such as passport issuance, entry into the country, work, and residence) and obligations (taxation, national duty, etc.). For a detailed analysis, please refer to our article on Dual Citizenship: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Requirements.\n\nThe concept of dual nationality has undergone significant changes over the years. Once considered alien, it is now openly and widely discussed, particularly since the end of the Cold War, marking an era where a more liberal approach towards dual citizenship began to emerge. This shift is attributed, in part, to greater gender equality and the abandonment of mandatory military service. The connection to gender equality is argued through the discriminatory act of women having to relinquish their nationality after marriage for their husband\u2019s, causing related problems. The UN Declaration of Human Rights underscores everyone\u2019s right to nationality, emphasizing its fundamental nature in the global discourse on citizenship.\n\nWhy Covet European Nationality?\n\nEurope, being one of the largest destinations for immigrants, welcomed 86.7 million international immigrants in 2020. Holding an EU citizenship comes with numerous advantages. Being a citizen of any of the 27 EU member states automatically grants EU citizenship, facilitating work and residence in another EU state without the need for a visa or additional permits. Consequently, it is not surprising that in 2021, 827,300 people acquired EU citizenship, with 85% of them transitioning from non-EU countries to enjoy the benefits that come with EU citizenship.\n\nStory continues\n\nEuropean Attitude Towards Dual Citizenship\n\nAccording to The Macimide Global Expatriate Dual Citizenship Database, the European Union has witnessed a notable shift in policies regarding dual citizenship. The percentage of countries automatically revoking citizenship upon acquisition of another has decreased from 63% in 1960 to 24% in 2020, signaling an increasing tolerance for dual citizenship. Despite this trend, specific countries such as Austria, Germany, Estonia, Bulgaria, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands remain hesitant to permit dual citizenship, enforcing strict rules for exceptions.\n\nGlobal Players in the European Market\n\nThe European market is expanding by attracting a diverse range of immigrants through its acceptance of dual citizenship and various citizenship programs. This growth is evident in the presence of various multinational corporations operating in the market, such as ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ: ASML) and AstraZeneca plc (NYSE: AZN). The appeal of dual citizenship not only contributes to demographic diversity but also fosters economic development by drawing in skilled professionals and entrepreneurs. This intersection of diverse immigration policies and a flourishing corporate landscape underscores Europe's attractiveness as a global destination for both individuals and businesses alike.\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ: ASML), a Dutch multinational company, stands out as a pivotal player with a profound impact on the flourishing tech world. The company has earned a significant reputation in the industry, being recognized as Europe's AI champion and hailed as \"the continent\u2019s most valuable tech firm.\" ASML Holding N.V.'s contributions are evidently crucial to the advancements in technology, and their prominence underscores their noteworthy role in shaping the landscape of the tech industry in Europe and globally.\n\nAstraZeneca plc (NYSE: AZN) stands as another prominent global firm, albeit in a different industry. As a pharmaceutical giant, the company is characterized by continuous innovation and sustained growth. Notably, at the close of the previous year, AstraZeneca plc (NYSE: AZN) made headlines by expressing their intent to acquire their first vaccine company, signaling a strategic move to expand their business portfolio. This strategic decision underlines AstraZeneca's commitment to staying at the forefront of advancements in the pharmaceutical sector. 17 European Countries that Allow Dual Citizenship\n\n17 European Countries that Allow Dual Citizenship\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our compilation of the 17 European Countries that Allow Dual Citizenship, we have gathered data from diverse sources, including ImmigrantInvest, Henley & Partners, and the CIA\u2019s World Fact Book-- Citizenship, to determine which European nations permit dual citizenship. We specifically focused on those countries that offer dual citizenship without imposing additional conditions. Our presentation follows a descending order based on the Human Development Index for the year 2021, providing a comprehensive overview of European countries that embrace dual citizenship without stringent requirements.\n\nNOTE: We have also considered Cyprus in our list. Although it is geographically located in West Asia, the country is culturally Southeast European.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n17 European Countries that Allow Dual Citizenship\n\n17. Serbia\n\nHDI Index: 0.802\n\nA European nation that embraces dual citizenship, citizens of this country, whether acquired through birthright or naturalization, are exempt from the obligation of renouncing their citizenship when seeking another nationality. Likewise, foreign nationals are not mandated to release their previous citizenship when becoming citizens of this country. This nation is renowned for offering one of the most favorable citizenship through investment programs, among other pathways to citizenship. Notably, the investment program allows individuals to attain residency in three years and citizenship in six, highlighting the efficiency and attractiveness of the country's citizenship acquisition process.\n\n16. Romania\n\nHDI Index: 0.821\n\nIndeed, Romania is among the countries that have embraced the concept of dual nationality. According to Romanian law, citizens of the country have the right to acquire another citizenship without the requirement of renouncing their Romanian citizenship. Additionally, foreign individuals obtaining Romanian citizenship are granted the same rights as other citizens, including the option for dual citizenship. While the standard naturalization period is approximately 8 years, the route through marriage shortens it to five years. Furthermore, obtaining citizenship through descent is a popular pathway for Romanian nationality, applicable if one or both parents are Romanian citizens, at least one parent or grandparent lost citizenship, or at least one parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent lost citizenship involuntarily. This inclusive approach reflects Romania's openness to diverse routes for acquiring and maintaining citizenship.\n\n15. Portugal\n\nHDI Index: 0.866\n\nPortugal is another European country that acknowledges and permits dual citizenship. Portuguese nationals seeking another nationality can do so without the obligation to renounce their original citizenship. Similarly, foreign individuals applying for Portuguese citizenship need not concern themselves with the status of their previous nationality. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for those aspiring to relocate to Portugal and experience the country's high quality of life. Portugal is renowned for its notable five-year residence investment program, the Golden Visa plan, which is available for non-EU individuals. Additionally, a faster route to citizenship is through descent, a fortunate option for some individuals with Portuguese ancestry. This diversity in pathways underscores Portugal's commitment to providing accessible and inclusive opportunities for citizenship.\n\n14. Greece\n\nHDI Index: 0.887\n\nAccording to Greek Law, specifically Art. 31 Civil Code and Art 2 par. 2 Law 4251/2014, dual citizenship is permitted. Individuals acquiring citizenship in another country are not required to renounce their Greek citizenship. However, it is important to note that some countries do not accept dual citizenship, and decisions must align with the laws of both nations involved. For EU nationals, acquiring Greek citizenship requires three years of residency in the country, while non-EU citizens must reside for a minimum of seven years. The Greece Golden Visa Program, involving an investment of at least \u20ac250,000, provides an affordable pathway to gain residency and eventually citizenship in the country. This initiative enhances accessibility for individuals seeking to establish a connection with Greece through investment and residency.\n\n13. Italy\n\nHDI Index: 0.895\n\nItaly is indeed among the countries that accept dual or multiple citizenships. If a foreigner opts to apply for Italian citizenship, there is no requirement to renounce their previous citizenship, and similarly, an Italian citizen acquiring foreign nationality need not relinquish their Italian citizenship. The benefits of Italian citizenship, such as enhanced work opportunities and the ability to purchase property, make the country an attractive destination for prospective expatriates. Particularly advantageous is Italy's citizenship by descent, offering one of the fastest routes to acquiring citizenship. For individuals with Italian ancestors, there is no limit to the number of generations or individuals who can claim citizenship through descent, and the time period for the process can range from three months to three years. This inclusive approach contributes to Italy's appeal for those with ancestral ties to the country.\n\n12. Cyprus\n\nHDI Index: 0.896\n\nCyprus stands out as a nation that not only offers multiple pathways to citizenship but also facilitates the process by recognizing dual citizenship. The country's immigration laws do not compel its citizens to renounce their Cypriot nationality when acquiring citizenship in another country. However, the recognition of dual nationality with Cyprus by other countries may vary. This policy is particularly advantageous for expatriates aspiring to immigrate to Cyprus, a nation known for providing a high quality of life for its citizens. Notably, Cyprus's citizenship by investment programs offers an expedited route for high-net-worth individuals to gain citizenship in as little as six to eight months, further enhancing the appeal of the country as a destination for those seeking a swift and accessible pathway to citizenship.\n\n11. France\n\nHDI Index: 0.903\n\nFrance also allows for dual or multiple nationality, enabling immigrants to maintain their original citizenship while also acquiring French citizenship and enjoying the same privileges as native citizens. French nationals seeking additional citizenship elsewhere can also do so without facing any negative consequences regarding their French nationality. The country provides various avenues for obtaining citizenship, and the French Talent Passport stands out as a well-known method for securing residency and citizenship, reflecting France's commitment to attracting and integrating skilled individuals into its society. This inclusive approach is indicative of France's recognition of the benefits of cultural diversity and global talent.\n\n10. Malta\n\nHDI Index: 0.918\n\nSignificant changes to Malta's citizenship laws occurred in the year 2000, ushering in a new era. Since February 10, 2000, Maltese nationals have had the freedom to acquire other citizenships without the risk of losing their original citizenship. This inclusive policy extends to foreign nationals as well, though the specific laws of the other country regarding dual nationality must be considered. Notably, investors who secure Maltese citizenship gain the privilege to work anywhere in the European Union, further enhancing the appeal of Malta as a destination for those seeking citizenship with expanded opportunities within the EU.\n\n9. United Kingdom\n\nHDI Index: 0.929\n\nThe British government does not impose any special conditions, such as the renunciation of previous citizenship, on individuals seeking dual citizenship. However, the concept of dual citizenship involves compliance with the laws of other countries governing citizenship protocols. The United Kingdom offers various pathways to citizenship, including the Innovator visa and Start-up visa, among others, providing individuals with diverse options to attain citizenship in the country. These programs contribute to the UK's openness to attracting and integrating talent from around the world, reflecting its commitment to cultural diversity and global innovation.\n\n8. Luxembourg\n\nHDI Index: 0.930\n\nThe Luxembourg Nationality Law of October 2008, which became effective on January 1, 2009, ushered in a policy allowing both Luxembourg nationals and foreign nationals to acquire dual or multiple citizenships. Notably, the renunciation of original citizenship is not required in either case, though it is essential to consider the rules of the other country involved. For instance, countries like the Netherlands do not accept dual nationality. Luxembourg provides various avenues for obtaining citizenship, with naturalization being one method that takes approximately 5 years to complete the citizenship process.\n\n7. Belgium\n\nHDI Index: 0.940\n\nThe Belgian government adopted a comprehensive stance on dual citizenship in two phases. In the first phase, starting from June 9, 2007, Belgians acquiring citizenship in countries not party to the Council of Europe Convention were permitted to retain their Belgian citizenship. The second phase, beginning on April 28, 2008, allowed Belgians voluntarily obtaining another citizenship to also maintain their original one. These policy changes are highly advantageous, providing convenient access for immigrants seeking to move for an improved quality of life. Belgium's commitment to dual citizenship reflects its openness to embracing cultural diversity and facilitating the integration of individuals from various backgrounds.\n\n6. Finland\n\nHDI Index: 0.940\n\nFinnish legislation permits dual citizenship, allowing individuals to retain their Finnish citizenship even when applying for another citizenship. Similarly, foreign nationals acquiring Finnish citizenship need not renounce their original citizenship, subject to compliance with the dual citizenship laws of the other country involved. Despite the allowance for dual nationality, there is a unique provision where an individual might lose their Finnish citizenship at the age of 22 if they fail to establish a connection with the country. Various pathways exist for obtaining Finnish citizenship, with the standard residency requirement being 5 years. However, if an individual attains the required language skills, citizenship can be applied for in a shorter period of 4 years, showcasing Finland's commitment to facilitating integration for those who meet specific criteria.\n\nClick to continue reading and see our 5 European Countries that Allow Dual Citizenship.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n17 Countries That Give Citizenship by Marriage in the World 16 Countries That Allow Multiple Citizenship in the World 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain\n\nDisclosure: None. 17 European Countries that Allow Dual Citizenship is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "3 ETFs with Big Nvidia Positions: SMH, IYW, SPMO",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is taking the market by storm, and it\u2019s not just the stock that is benefiting. Three ETFs with big positions in Nvidia, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW), and the Invesco S&P Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA:SPMO) are reaping the rewards of Nvidia\u2019s historic run and look poised to capture more upside if shares continues to rise.\n\nTo find these ETFs featuring significant Nvidia exposure, I went to Nvidia\u2019s page on TipRanks and used the ETF Exposure tab on the side of the page, a useful tool that enables investors to sort through ETFs by a stock\u2019s percentage weight within the ETF.\n\nLet\u2019s take a more in-depth look at these three ETFs, which all have different strategies and different reasons for owning Nvidia. All have large positions in the surging stock, which is up 235.5% over the past year and closing in on a $2 trillion market cap.\n\n1. VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH)\n\nSMH is a $16 billion ETF from VanEck that, according to the fund, seeks to give investors \u201cexposure to the top 25 most liquid U.S.-listed semiconductor companies, spanning the entire industry value chain from chip design and fabrication to manufacturing machinery.\u201d\n\nSMH has a massive Nvidia position. In fact it makes up over one-quarter of this semiconductor-focused fund\u2019s assets, with a weighting of 25.7%.\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find an overview of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia, SMH owns Nvidia\u2019s competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and it also owns companies that are vital to the semiconductor manufacturing process like foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and semiconductor equipment manufacturers Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML).\n\nSMH\u2019s top holdings are viewed favorably by TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score system, as eight out of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis ETF has crushed the market in recent years, thanks in no small part to its outsized position in Nvidia. As of January 31, SMH has returned an impressive 18.8% over the past three years, a phenomenal 32.1% over the past five years, and an incredible 26.1% over the past 10 years, easily beating the broader market S&P 500 (SPX) and tech-oriented Nasdaq (NDX) indices over each time frame.\n\nOf note, SMH has an expense ratio of 0.35%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $35 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on SMH, given its large position in Nvidia, its track record of market-beating performance, and its portfolio of highly-rated stocks (according to Smart Score ratings). For investors looking to gain exposure to Nvidia in ETF form, SMH is a great way to do so due to its massive 25.7% Nvidia position and the fact that it gives you exposure to additional stocks that are swimming in the same lane as Nvidia.\n\nIs SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nSell-side analysts view SMH favorably, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $223.22 implies 6.1% upside potential from current levels.\n\n2. iShares U.S. Technology ETF\u00a0(IYW)\n\nMeanwhile, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF owns Nvidia as part of its strategy to \u201ctrack the investment results of an index composed of U.S. equities in the technology sector.\u201d IYW invests in U.S.-based electronics companies, computer hardware and software companies, and IT companies.\n\nNvidia makes up 6.8% of IYW\u2019s assets under management. This is a relatively large position, but it pales in comparison to SMH\u2019s massive 25.7% position.\u00a0Altogether, IYW owns 135 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 63.9% of the fund.\n\nBelow is an overview of IYW\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 Holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, IYW has a broader focus than SMH, so while it has top-10 positions in semiconductor stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), it also owns stocks from beyond the semiconductor space like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nLike SMH, IYW\u2019s portfolio is viewed favorably by TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score, and even more so, an impressive nine out of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above.\n\nWhile this ETF\u2019s focus is different than SMH\u2019s, one thing that the two funds have in common is that they\u2019ve both generated excellent returns over time. As of January 31, IYW has put up annualized returns of 14.2% over the past three years, 24.5% over the past five years, and 20.2% over the past 10 years.\n\nIYW has an expense ratio of 0.40%, meaning that investors in the fund will pay $40 in fees annually on a $10,000 investment.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on IYW overall, given its strong track record of performance and its highly-rated portfolio of top tech stocks, although it should be noted that SMH gives investors considerably more exposure to Nvidia.\n\nIs IYW Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts assign IYW a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 106 Buys,\u00a027 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average IYW stock price target of $145.91 implies 10.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\n3. Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF\u00a0(SPMO)\n\nLastly, the Invesco S&P 500 ETF is another large Nvidia holder with an entirely different approach.\u00a0SPMO is \u201cbased on the S&P 500 Momentum Index,\u201d which \u201ctracks the performance of stocks in the S&P 500 Index that have a high \u2018momentum score.\u2019\u201d The fund and index are reconstituted and rebalanced twice a year, and components of the index are weighted by their market caps and their momentum scores.\n\nNvidia makes up 11.4% of SPMO\u2019s holdings, which is less than SMH\u2019s exposure but more than IYW\u2019s.\u00a0In total, SPMO owns 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 56.1% of the fund.\n\nBelow is an overview of SPMO\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nSPMO isn\u2019t specifically focused on semiconductor or technology stocks like SMH or IYW, but some of these stocks, like Nvidia and Broadcom, appear in SPMO\u2019s top holdings, as these stocks have been leading the market higher. Beyond semiconductors, Meta Platforms is SPMO\u2019s largest holding, and the fund also owns plenty of names from outside of the tech sector that are performing well, like Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nAn impressive nine out of SPMO\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 9 or higher.\u00a0Like SMH and IYW, SPMO has also generated good returns over time, although it doesn\u2019t have a track record as long as that of the other two funds, as it only launched in 2015. Still, as of January 31, SPMO had posted a solid three-year annualized return of 10.9% and an even better five-year annualized return of 15.1%.\n\nSPMO is reasonably priced, with an expense ratio of just 0.13%, making it the cheapest of the three funds profiled here. An investor in SPMO will pay just $13 annually in fees on a $10,000 investment. I\u2019m bullish on SPMO based on its decent performance, highly-rated portfolio, and substantial Nvidia position.\n\nIs SPMO Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAnalysts view the fund favorably, as SPMO earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 87 Buys, 12 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPMO stock price target of $81.45 implies 6.3% upside potential from current levels.\n\nNo Shortage of Ways to Invest in Nvidia\n\nAll three of these ETFs are good options for investors, as they have strong portfolios and have generated solid returns over time. Any of the three is a worthy investment, but my pick of the three is SMH, as it offers by far the highest exposure to Nvidia, plus the best performance track record.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Just Begging for a Stock-Split",
        "content": "Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) helped launch a new bull market after bottoming in the fall of 2022. Some of Wall Street's biggest runners have multiplied in value, trading as high as $1,000 per share today.\n\nThat means that investors may want to start looking for potential stock splits. Investors generally favor stock splits, and for good reason. It makes accumulating shares of a company far more manageable. But it's important to know what a split does and doesn't do.\n\nHere is what you need to know. Plus, here are three prime AI stock-split candidates to watch.\n\nWhat stock splits do -- and don't do\n\nAs you may already know, a stock split lowers a company's share price. It does this by proportionately increasing the number of outstanding shares. For example, suppose you have stock XYZ that trades at $100 per share. Splitting the stock 5:1 would mean that each $100 share would turn into five $20 shares.\n\nCompanies split their stock for varied reasons, but it's generally because they perceive that investors generally like lower share prices. It can break through some investors' \"psychological barrier\" to buying shares above a certain price range. Announcing a split also has a propensity to draw investors' attention to a company's stock. Additionally, employees with stock-based compensation can manage their equity more easily and employers can arrange for stock-based compensation easier when share prices are lower. It's easier to divvy up 100 pennies than a single dollar bill.\n\nWhat stock splits don't do is change the business's intrinsic value. Always remember that the additional shares offset the lower price you see. In other words, a pie doesn't get any bigger whether you cut it four ways, eight ways, or 16 ways. The slices change size, but the overall pie remains the same.\n\nSo, which companies might split their stocks next? These three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are ripe for a split after going on epic runs.\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nModular server company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has seen its business take off in recent quarters. Companies investing in AI are seeking out SMCI's turnkey computing systems. The company's revenue more than doubled year over year in the second quarter of its fiscal year 2024, and management guided up to 219% year-over-year growth next quarter.\n\nSupermicro, as it is also known, started with motherboards in the early 1990s and evolved as computers and servers advanced. The business went public in 2007 and has never split its stock. However, the stock's remarkable recent performance has shares hovering near $1,000. That's nearly a 3,000% gain over the past three years. SMCI Chart\n\nThe company has paid stock-based compensation over the years, and some employees sitting on years-old equity may appreciate a stock split that helps them manage their newly found wealth. Additionally, the stock has become a big pill to swallow for individual investors who may not want to drop $1,000 to own one share of the company. A stock split makes a ton of sense here.\n\n2. ASML\n\nPhotolithography equipment manufacturer ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) is another stock that's enjoyed a magnificent run over the past few years. The company designs and sells equipment that uses ultraviolet light to print complex circuitry onto silicon wafers. The most advanced semiconductors, like those used to power the latest AI models, need specialized extreme ultraviolet light machines, and ASML is the only company that makes them.\n\nThat helps explain why ASML's stock has done so well. ASML has split its stock multiple times before, so management has shown it's willing to do so. However, it's been a while. The last split occurred before 2015, and the stock has appreciated enormously since. ASML Chart\n\nAnalysts expect the business to grow earnings by an average of 20% annually over the next three to five years. Barring a sudden drop in the stock's valuation, ASML could eventually trade at over $1,000 per share. Most stocks on U.S. exchanges trade under $1,000 per share, making it more plausible that a stock split could happen in the next few years.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nSocial media giant and AI innovator Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) didn't seem like a stock-split candidate a year ago. The company struggled with privacy changes to iOS devices and was criticized for aggressive spending. The stock bottomed in late 2022 at roughly $90 per share.\n\nBut, as good CEOs do, Mark Zuckerberg adapted. Spending cuts and new AI-based advertising technology have sent the stock to nearly $500. Meta Platforms has never split its stock, but the company didn't go public until 2012. The conversation about a stock split seems more appropriate than ever, with shares at all-time highs. META Chart\n\nMeta's core business, growing its social media audience and advertising, is still performing well. The company's family of apps reached 3.98 billion monthly active users in 2023, a 6% increase over last year. Analysts see Meta's earnings compounding at 20% annually for the next several years, adding more fuel to the odds that investors see a stock split occur.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Ken Fisher Portfolio: 12 Biggest Positions",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at Ken Fisher's latest investment portfolio and the 12 biggest positions. If you want to skip our overview of Fisher, his investment firm, and the broader U.S. stock market and macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at Ken Fisher Portfolio: 5 Biggest Positions.\n\nKen Fisher is one of the richest people in the world courtesy of his hedge fund Fisher Asset Management. The fund had $203 billion in investments spread across its portfolio according to filings with the SEC. Fisher set up his hedge fund nearly five decades ago in 1979 and served as its CEO until 2016 before relinquishing the role. Right now, he's the Executive Chairman of Fisher Investments and holds the title of co-chief investment officer along with Jeff Silk.\n\nA $203 billion investment portfolio is no small achievement, even if the highly risky nature of the hedge fund industry sees the biggest players such as Ken Griffin's Citadel and Seth Klarman's Baupost often take leverage to fund their bets and double their returns. Investment portfolios of this size mean that not only do Fisher Investment's clients have to trust the firm, but also that the hedge fund has to demonstrate that it is able to outperform either the market or the economy or at least serve as a buffer against sharp capital depreciation during times of economic turmoil.\n\nThe start of the year is the tone setting mood for stock markets, and for Fisher Investments, the year did not miss out on a beat after the firm had to jump in to release an unusual press release. This press release countered a report by the Wall Street Journal that had stated that Ken Fisher's firm, over which he holds 100% control through a trust that he shares with his wife, was being sold to the Boston, Massachusetts based private equity firm Advent International. The WSJ was not the only publication that cited anonymous sources for its report, as Bloomberg also published a similar piece which outlined that Advent had had talks to\u00a0 \"acquire billionaire Ken Fisher's eponymous Fisher Investments, according to a person with knowledge of the matter\" but also went on to quote Fisher Investment's response that bluntly denied any such speculation.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact Fisher's firm, which is quite widely covered in the press and is known for its founder's ability to generate buzz, was quite hard hitting its response. Its press release bluntly stated:\n\nFisher Investments is not being bought by Advent International, or anyone else\u2014plain and simple.\n\nThe story also had numerous other inaccuracies. Had The Wall Street Journal's reporters bothered to verify the facts, we would have corrected their reporting. Instead, The Wall Street Journal printed the rumors first and followed up with us last.\n\nThe WSJ's coverage had speculated that not only was Advent having 'talks' to acquire Fisher Investments, but that the hedge fund might see other partners emerge for a deal. Reading Fisher's press release, while it did deny that a transaction was not officially underway, the text nevertheless missed out on sharing any details of potential 'talks' - leading to the assumption that since there were no talks for a potential sale, there was no need to deny them in the press release.\n\nMoving forward to other news in 2024, the year has started off by providing investors with the latest data set to read the tea leaves and see where the Federal Reserve's current interest rate hiking cycle will be at the year's close. This data set is the retail sales for January which showed an 0.8% annual drop that came as part of a release that saw the Commerce Department also revise down the data for December.\n\nOn the surface, this data paints a softer picture of the economy that shows that as consumers face the pinch of high interest rates, they are starting to cut down their spending. However, economists also preached caution after the release, as they speculated that while it is possible that a spending, and by extension economic, slump had led to the sales falling, the contribution of cold temperatures across the U.S. could not be completely ignored in the aftermath of the release.\n\nHowever, and as has been the case for more than a year now, the optimistic data set was followed by the exact opposite just a day later. On Friday, data from the Labor Department revealed that import prices jumped by 0.8% in January, which was the high reading since the first quarter of 2022. In short, nearly a two year old record of an inflationary indicator was broken, and perhaps unsurprisingly, when paired by the producer price index (PPI)'s 0.3% jump in January, futures linked to the S&P 500 and other indexes dropped.\n\nWith the fourth quarter hedge fund filing season well on its way, we decided to see which stocks Fisher Investments is piling into as the year gets off to a roaring start. Some notable names are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Ken Fisher Portfolio: 12 Biggest Positions\n\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the biggest stakes in Ken Fisher's investment portfolio, we ranked Fisher Investments' fourth quarter of 2024 investment portfolio by the dollar value of the stakes and picked out the biggest positions.\n\nKen Fisher Portfolio: 12 Biggest Positions\n\n12. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nFisher Investments' Q4 2023 Stake: 2.6 billion\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an American pharmaceutical and healthcare giant headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. Amidst the fire injected into its stock by weight loss drugs such as Mounjaro, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) scored a big win in February 2024 when Morgan Stanley increased its share price to $950 for a whopping $145 increase. This makes the share price target the highest on Wall Street, and the average Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) share price target is $757 - below the current share price.\n\nAs of Q4 2023 end, 102 out of the 933 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had held a stake in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the firm's largest hedge fund shareholder in Q4 due to its $2.6 billion stake.\n\nAlong with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is one of Fisher Investment's top stock picks.\n\n11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nFisher Investments' Q4 2023 Stake: $2.7 billion\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an American software company headquartered in San Jose, California. It is one of the biggest companies in the world when it comes to productivity software and products.

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)'s biggest investor among these is Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management as it owns $2.7 billion worth of shares.\n\n10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nFisher Investments' Q4 2023 Stake: $3 billion\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is one of the biggest pureplay home improvement product retailers in the world. Ahead of a key earnings report that will help investors form expectations for the key retail market's future in 2024, the firm is heading to its report after having beaten analyst EPS estimates in all four of the latest quarters.\n\nAfter digging through 933 hedge fund portfolios for 2023's fourth quarter, Insider Monkey found that 70 had bought and owned The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)'s shares. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell's Arrowstreet Capital was the firm's second largest stakeholder since it owned 1.5 million shares that were worth $528 million.\n\n9. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nFisher Investments' Q4 2023 Stake: $3.2 billion\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer whose production facilities form the backbone of global high end semiconductor fabrication. 2024 has seen the firm enter the A.I. era on a strong note, with management sharing during the latest earnings report that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is in a strong position to capture any A.I. semiconductor demand.\n\nInsider Monkey's December quarter of 2023 survey covering 933 hedge funds revealed that 105 were the firm's shareholders.

(NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nFisher Investments' Q4 2023 Stake: $3.8 billion\n\nThe presence of ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) after TSMC on our list of Ken Fisher's biggest investment positions is apt since without its machines, TSMC would be unable to make most of its high-end products. ASML is virtually a monopoly when it comes to making scanners that can produce advanced chips with feature sizes 5-nanometer and below, which also positions it favorably should an investor seek to capitalize on growing global spending on artificial intelligence processors and graphics processing units.\n\nAs 2024's final quarter ended, 62 out of the 933 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) 's shares. After Fisher's firm, the company's largest stakeholder was Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners due to its $1 billion investment.\n\n7. Salesforce, Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 11 best semiconductor stocks to invest in. To skip the detailed analysis of the industry, go directly to the 5 Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Invest In.\n\nIt won\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that the semiconductor industry is the backbone of advancements in the tech sector. Deloitte predicts the current year will be quite favorable for the semiconductor industry. The industry saw a 9.4% YoY sales decline in 2023 to $520 billion. In 2024, the industry sales are expected to reach a record $588 billion, up from the previous $574 billion in 2022.\n\nDespite the dip in sales, the semiconductor industry performed well in 2023 and is still gaining in the current year. VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) was up nearly 100% in 2023, and iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) gained close to 80%. At the time of writing on February 23, the former has gained 24.18% year-to-date (YTD), while the latter is up 15.22%.\n\nBetween 2023 and 2032, the semiconductor market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 12.3% and reach $1.8 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.\n\nDon't Miss: 11 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom\n\nSemiconductor equipment stocks include companies that manufacture tools to make computer chips in clean rooms, testing devices for both production and research and fixtures to support the semiconductor fabrication facility. According to Grand View Research, the semiconductor equipment market is expected to reach $110.5 billion in 2024 from $103.1 billion in 2023.\n\nSupply chain issues have been haunting the semiconductor industry since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some of the major players in the industry believe that it is on the way to its recovery. One of the big names in the semiconductor equipment space, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\u2019s President & Chief Executive Officer, Peter Wennink, said the following at the company\u2019s latest earnings call:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIndustry end market inventory levels continue to improve, moving towards more healthy levels. Lithography 2 utilization levels are still running lower than normal but are now improving in both logic and memory. We expect utilization levels to continue to improve over the course of this year.\n\nAnd lastly, as mentioned by Roger, we saw very strong order intake in the fourth quarter in support of future demand. To be able to follow the curve of the industry recovery, we are looking at the combined demand for 2024 and 2025. As mentioned last quarter, we fueled 2024 as a transition year in preparation with the expected strong demand in 2025. We, therefore, continue to make investment this year, both in capacity ramp and in technology to be ready for the upturn in the cycle.\u201d\n\nHowever, Peter Wennink also warned that market uncertainty persists because of several global macroeconomic concerns. Keeping that in mind, apart from ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), some of the best semiconductor equipment stocks include Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX). 11 Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Invest In\n\nA robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified semiconductor equipment stocks with a market capitalization of $3 billion and above trading on the NYSE and NASDAQ.

        "title": "SOXQ: This Low-Fee Semiconductor ETF Is Overlooked",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have unquestionably been the hottest part of the market, and the Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXQ) is an excellent way for investors to play the semiconductor space.\u00a0I\u2019m bullish on this sometimes overlooked semiconductor ETF based on the strong historical performance of its underlying index, its highly-rated portfolio of top semiconductor stocks from across the semiconductor value chain, and its favorable expense ratio.\n\nWhat Is the SOXQ ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nSOXQ is based on its underlying index, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index.\n\nAccording to Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), this index is \u201cdesigned to measure the performance of the 30 largest U.S.-listed securities of companies engaged in the semiconductor business. Semiconductors include products such as memory chips, microprocessors, integrated circuits and related equipment that serve a wide variety of purposes in various types of electronics, including in personal household products, automobiles, and computers, among others.\u201d\n\nSOXQ invests in \u201ccompanies engaged in the design, distribution, manufacture and sale of semiconductors. The index is reconstituted annually (each September) and rebalanced on a quarterly basis.\n\nSOXQ\u2019s Holdings\n\nAs discussed above, SOXQ holds 30 semiconductor stocks. Its top 10 holdings make up a relatively high 64.0% of assets.\u00a0Below is an overview of SOXQ\u2019s top 10 holdings from TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, SOXQ gives investors plenty of exposure to the company leading the generative AI revolution, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has a weighting of 10.7% in the fund. It also gives investors plenty of exposure to the competitors trying to close the gap with Nvidia in this area, like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nAnother thing that I really like about SOXQ is that it invests across the semiconductor value chain, not just in chip developers like Nvidia and its peers. For example, within its top 10 holdings, SOXQ has positions in Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, or foundry, which manufacturers chips for the likes of many of the other companies on this list like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fund also owns stocks like Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), which provide the equipment and machinery used in the semiconductor manufacturing process.\n\nI like that SOXQ invests in these companies, as they play pivotal roles in the semiconductor supply chain and because they enjoy significant moats around their businesses. Only a handful of companies in the world have the technological expertise to produce cutting-edge semiconductors or the complex machinery required to produce them.\n\nAll of these companies have posted strong performances over the past year. For instance, Lam Research is up 96.9%, Applied Materials is up 78.4%, ASML is up 50.4%, and Taiwan Semiconductor is up 45.5%.\n\nFurthermore, all of these stocks enjoy Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores from TipRanks. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 Smart Score, while Lam Research, Applied Materials, and ASML all have Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above. More broadly, an impressive nine out of SOXQ\u2019s top 10 holdings enjoy Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or better.\n\nSOXQ itself comes in with an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8.\n\nHistorical Performance of SOXQ\u2019s Index\n\nSOXQ only launched in 2021, so it doesn\u2019t yet have a very long track record of performance.\u00a0The fund lost 35.6% in 2022, when the tech sector struggled, but came roaring back with a massive 66.7% gain in 2023 when advances in AI drove a tech sector rebound led by semiconductor stocks.\n\nHowever, luckily for us, SOXQ\u2019s underlying index, the PHLX Semiconductor Index, has been around for a long time, giving us a basis to judge how SOXQ would have performed historically. As of January 31, the index has posted impressive returns of 15.4% on a three-year annualized basis, 29.3% on a five-year annualized basis, and 25.3% on a 10-year annualized basis.\n\nA Favorable Expense Ratio\n\nWith an expense ratio of just 0.19%, SOXQ is a cost-effective option for investors.\u00a0This 0.19% expense ratio means that an investor will pay just $19 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nIn addition to being inexpensive in general, SOXQ\u2019s expense ratio is also considerably lower than those of its peers. For example, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), and the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:XSD) all have identical expense ratios of 0.35%.\n\nSOXQ\u2019s ratio is likely cheaper because it is newer and trying to compete with these ETFs, which works out in investors\u2019 favor.\n\nHow much of a difference does this make over time? Assuming that the ETFs return 5% per year going forward and maintain their current expense ratios, an investor putting $10,000 into SOXQ would pay $243 in fees over the course of the next 10 years. Meanwhile, an investor putting $10,000 into any of the three larger ETFs would pay $443 in fees over the same period.\n\nAs you can see, while SOXQ is a smaller fund, it offers a more cost-effective way to invest in the semiconductor sector.\n\nIs SOXQ Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SOXQ earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buys, six Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SOXQ stock price target of $39.91 implies 9.8% upside potential.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe SOXQ ETF offers investors an excellent way to invest in the red-hot semiconductor sector. I\u2019m bullish on SOXQ because it features a strong portfolio of highly-rated stocks across the semiconductor supply chain, from generative AI darling Nvidia to the companies making the chips and the equipment needed to make them.\n\nI\u2019m also constructive on the relatively new ETF based on the strong historical performance of its underlying index and because it is one of the cheapest ways to broadly invest in the semiconductor space, with an expense ratio that is considerably lower than that of its peers.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: This Stock Is Poised for a Potential Bull Run in 2024",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia remained a hot commodity on the stock market in 2024 with solid gains of 58% already, which is not surprising as the chipmaker is already projected to deliver another outstanding year of revenue and earnings growth because of the booming demand for graphics cards used in artificial intelligence (AI) servers.\n\nHowever, there is another semiconductor bellwether whose shares have gained solid momentum on the market. ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) stock is already up 25% in 2024, and management's comments in the company's latest annual report indicate that it could keep heading higher as the year progresses.\n\nLet's look at the reasons why ASML stock's bull run is set to continue in 2024. We will also check why it could turn out to be a solid bet for investors looking to buy a semiconductor stock right now but may not be comfortable with Nvidia's rich valuation.\n\nASML Holding will benefit from higher chip spending in 2024\n\nASML CFO Roger Dassen remarked in the company's annual report that the semiconductor equipment market is now in recovery mode:\n\nWe believe that the market has now reached the lowest point of the dip, and although we cannot predict the exact nature of the slope ahead, the recovery is nascent. The longer-term trends are unmistakable -- artificial intelligence, electrification, and the energy transition are happening, and those factors are underlined by the large number of fabs that are set to open in the next couple of years. All of these new fabs will need our tools.\n\nAccording to the semiconductor industry association SEMI, 42 new semiconductor fabrication plants are set to begin operations in 2024. That's a big jump over just 11 fabs that went into operation last year, as well as the 29 new fabs that went online in 2022. This explains why the spending on semiconductor manufacturing equipment that ASML sells is expected to increase in 2024, following a 6% decline in 2023 to $100 billion. By 2025, SEMI predicts equipment spending will jump to a record $124 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis jump in equipment spending is already driving solid growth in ASML's sales orders. The Dutch company received bookings worth 9.2 billion euros in the fourth quarter of 2023. That was a big jump as compared to bookings of 2.6 billion euros in the third quarter of 2023. As a result, ASML's order backlog stood at an impressive 39 billion euros at the end of the previous quarter.\n\nThat's higher than the company's revenue forecast for the current year. ASML delivered 27.6 billion euros in revenue in 2023, and it expects a similar level of revenue in 2024. However, the sizable backlog and the uptick in semiconductor spending could eventually help the company deliver stronger growth and help ensure that ASML stock's bull run continues. What's more, ASML is confident of delivering a sharp jump in revenue in 2025 as well.\n\nThe company reiterated its 2025 revenue guidance of 30 billion euros to 40 billion euros for 2025, along with a gross margin of 54% to 56%. It won't be surprising to see ASML hitting the higher end of that guidance range, considering the backlog it is sitting on, as well as the fact that the company is going to raise the production capacity of its latest extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machine, which is priced at $350 million.\n\nAll this indicates why analysts are expecting a significant jump in the company's earnings from 2025. ASML EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nInvestors can expect the stock to jump strongly in 2024 and beyond\n\nWe have already seen that ASML is capable of delivering stronger earnings growth than what analysts are anticipating, thanks to improving market conditions and its backlog. But even if the company's earnings jump to $36 per share in 2026 and the stock trades at 35 times forward earnings at that time -- equal to its five-year average forward earnings multiple -- its stock price could jump to $1,260. That would be a 38% jump from current levels.\n\nHowever, the market could reward ASML with a higher earnings multiple, considering the potential acceleration in its growth. Nvidia, for instance, trades at a whopping 96 times earnings and 40 times sales. ASML's price-to-sales ratio, on the other hand, is much cheaper at 12. ASML, therefore, gives investors an avenue to capitalize on the semiconductor industry's growth at a much cheaper multiple, which is why they should consider buying it before it soars further.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why ASML Stock and Applied Materials Just Popped, But Intel Dropped",
        "content": "Well, it's Thursday -- the day after news of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) Q4 earnings report dropped. And it's already pretty obvious how investors are reacting to the news.\n\nAs of noon ET, shares of Nvidia rival Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) are down 0.8% -- recovered somewhat from an earlier decline of more than 2%. In contrast, shares of ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) and Applied Materials(NASDAQ: AMAT), two suppliers of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment that's essential to grow supplies of in-demand AI semiconductor chips, are performing much better -- up 4.2% and 4.7%, respectively.\n\nNvidia's earnings report\n\nWhy the disparate reactions to Nvidia's news? Well, let's take a look at the report itself.\n\nNvidia reported 265% year-over-year growth in its revenues in Q4 -- $22.1 billion, exceeding Wall Street's expectations. Adjusted earnings were pretty fantastic as well, up 486% at $5.16 per share, and also ahead of expectations.\n\nFully 83% of Nvidia's sales came from the company's data center segment, by the way, which is weighted heavily toward production of chips for new artificial intelligence services. And as this is a relatively new business, the implication is that demand for these chips is red hot. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, AI has \"hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\" And this in turn implies that there's going to be need for even more production of AI chips, and therefore a need for more manufacturing equipment to make that production possible.\n\nRight there you've got your reason for why ASML and Applied Materials stocks are going up. (It doesn't hurt that this morning, ASML won a new buy rating from investment banker H.C. Wainwright, which said ASML holds a \"monopolistic position\" in lithography tools that will support its earnings.)\n\nMeanwhile, Intel investors may be feeling a bit left out as Nvidia roars ahead, gobbling up market share. Huang predicted Nvidia's sales will grow a further 8.5% sequentially in Q1 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Intel stock a sell? And are ASML and Applied Materials stocks buys?\n\nSo is all hope now lost for Intel? I don't think so.\n\nAll but lost in the uproar over Nvidia's earnings, you see, is the news that late last week, Bloomberg reported that Intel is in line to receive $10 billion in CHIPS and Science Act subsidies to build its new Ohio semiconductors factory. Also possibly lost in the shuffle: an announcement from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger that Intel has a whopping $15 billion in deals to manufacture semiconductor chips for other companies. These customers notably include Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), which wants to use Intel's \"18A\" technology to build a new artificial intelligence chip.\n\nAs money pours into the AI space from all directions, this seems like an excellent time to invest in pick-and-shovel plays such as ASML and Applied Materials. But what about Intel?\n\nWhile the stock still looks like something of a basket case with its weak earnings and even weaker (i.e. negative) free cash flow, sales are growing at Intel, too. And it seems obvious to me that Intel is going to want to get a piece of the fat AI profit margins that Nvidia keeps raking in. With customers clamoring at the door, and the U.S. government offering to foot much of the bill for Intel's expansion into AI, I wouldn't count Intel out of this race just yet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ASML wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "11 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best semiconductor stocks to invest in for the AI boom. If you want to skip our introduction covering how without the semiconductor industry, and how it's essential to the development of artificial intelligence, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom.\n\nEarlier this year, OpenAI's co founder and chief executive officer Sam Altman demonstrated his ability to remain in the news after he estimated that the total funding required to build an independent supply chain of semiconductors to fund all possible use cases for artificial intelligence could require $7 trillion in capital. Altman's talk with investors in the UAE reported by the Wall Street Journal involved his vision of a massive boost to global chip making foundries, energy, data centers, and other infrastructure required to sustain the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to fund artificial intelligence applications all over the world.\n\nWhile $7 trillion is more money than the annual economic output, or the GDP, of several countries, similar figures have been common in the semiconductor industry these past couple of months. In fact, it was semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang who stated during the firm's earnings call for the second quarter of its previous fiscal year:\n\nThe world has something along the lines of about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed, in the cloud, in enterprise and otherwise. And that $1 trillion of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We\u2019re seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. One is accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because it\u2019s the most cost-effective, most energy effective and the most performant way of doing computing now. So what you\u2019re seeing, and then all of a sudden, enabled by generative AI, enabled by accelerated compute and generative AI came along. And this incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuang and Altman's comments show that at least when some of the most influential persons in the high computing and semiconductor design industries are concerned, the global semiconductor industry can grow by the trillions of dollars.\n\nIn fact, on the day that Huang made the comments, NVIDIA's shares were trading in the $450 - $460 range, and had you believed him when he'd said that artificial intelligence and the broader advances in data center computing carry the potential to take his firm to new financial heights and bought NVIDIA's stock, then your investment would have delivered a price appreciation of roughly 45%.\n\nQuite impressive, but given that NVIDIA's stock is up by 230% over the past year, it does make one wonder where the rest of this growth comes from. Well, after its earnings press release for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 hit the wires, NVIDIA's shares gained 27% over the next couple of days. This was the first true surge in the semiconductor stock that is at the top of the food chain when we talk about artificial intelligence. Why did the shares jump more this time? Well, the press release saw Huang throw around the trillion dollar estimate for the first time.\n\nHowever, Huang and Altman are not the only semiconductor executives who have commented on artificial intelligence. In fact, since it's now become a major global phenomenon, managements of other semiconductor stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) have all weighed in. AMD's Su, whose firm is the only direct competitor to NVIDIA's products in non-Arm based GPU designs, believes that the artificial intelligence data center computing products market was worth $45 billion in 2023. Her remarks, made in December also shared the Santa Clara, California based chip designer's estimates that by 2027 end, this market will have grown to $400 billion.\n\nSimilarly, semiconductor stock TSMC's management confirmed that it had \"witnessed the rising emergence of generative AI-related applications\" in 2023. Likewise, Intel chief Patrick Gelsinger shared during the earnings call in January 2024 that not only had his firm witnessed \"the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030, but that Intel is the only company \"able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic.\"\n\nThe final bit of Gelsinger's comments is particularly important when we talk about semiconductor stocks that could benefit from AI-related tailwinds. This is because while chip stocks such as NASDAQ:NVDA, NASDAQ:INTC, NASDAQ:AMD, and NYSE:TSM are direct beneficiaries of the growth in AI, others like Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) can also benefit from booming AI demand as their products are indispensable when it comes to designing chips.\n\nToday, we'll talk about some such semiconductor stocks that hedge funds are buying in the era of artificial intelligence. 11 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom\n\nClose-up of a robotic endoluminal surgery device performing a procedure in an operating room.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best semiconductor stocks for the AI boom, we ranked semiconductor stocks that are directly or indirectly exposed to artificial intelligence by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023. Out of these, the top semiconductor stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these top semiconductor stocks for the AI boom, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That's why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom\n\n11. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 62\n\nAnalog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is an American semiconductor company that makes and sells chips that are used for power management, signal conversion, and other computing use cases. The shares are rated Buy on average, and the average analyst share price target is $206.\n\nDuring last year's fourth quarter, 62 out of the 944 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had bought and owned Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)'s shares. David Blood and Al Gore's Generation Investment Management was the firm's biggest investor due to its $864 million stake.\n\nAlong with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is a top hedge fund AI semiconductor stock pick.\n\n10. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 62\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is the backbone of the global semiconductor industry since it is the only firm in the world capable of making machines to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world. Investor infatuation with AI has also led to the firm becoming Europe's most valuable technology stock. However, the firm is entering 2024 amidst the constant global geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China that have seen ASML warn that more sanctions could hurt its business.\n\nAfter digging through 933 Q4 2023 hedge fund investment portfolios, Insider Monkey found that 62 had held a stake in the firm. The largest ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) hedge fund shareholder is Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management as it owns $3.7 billion worth of shares.\n\n9. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 67\n\nLam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a backend semiconductor company whose products enable chip designers like NVIDIA to fine tune their AI products. Since it isn't a monopoly like ASML, the firm has spent 2024 fighting for dominance in the South Korean market where it is facing tough competition from Japanese rivals.\n\nDuring 2023's December quarter, 67 out of the 933 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey were Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)'s shareholders. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management owned the biggest stake which was worth $2.3 billion.\n\n8. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 70\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is an American semiconductor equipment manufacturing and design company. Like most other firms in its industry, the business has had to adjust itself against sanctions imposed on China by the U.S. due to national security concerns.\n\nBy the end of last year's fourth quarter, 70 out of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research had invested in the firm. The largest Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) shareholder out of these is David Blood and Al Gore's Generation Investment Management since it holds a $1.1 billion stake.\n\n7. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 78\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a key artificial intelligence semiconductor stock to watch especially as the AI industry matures. This is because its sizeable presence in the Android smartphone processor and GPU market provides QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) with solid footing to introduce AI processors such as neural processing units (NPUs).\n\nAs 2023's fourth quarter ended, 78 out of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had piled into QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s shares. John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors was the biggest investor, owning 2.9 million shares that are worth $431 million.\n\n6. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 86\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is the world's biggest semiconductor designer since it is able to target both processing and memory semiconductor markets. This was confirmed by a Gartner report in early 2024 that stated that as the memory market shrunk in 2023, Intel overcame Samsung to take the global chip making crown.\n\nDuring Q4 2023, 86 out of the 933 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey were the firm's shareholders. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s largest hedge fund investor is William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management as it owns $801 million worth of shares.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) are some top hedge fund AI semiconductor stocks.\n\nClick here to continue reading and check out 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nMonopoly Definition and 11 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US 10 Small-Cap Energy Stocks with Strong Returns 50 Best Albert Einstein quotes about Life and More\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "ASML's AI-driven growth has lifted its stock to record highs, aligning with trends seen in Microsoft, Nvidia, and Arm, but despite concerns of a bubble, current indications suggest otherwise.\n\nMorgan Stanley research positions ASML as the second most \"overowned\" European equity, following Novo Nordisk in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nShares in the Dutch group have soared more than 20% since the start of the year, propelled by increased demand for chip technology on the back of fast-moving progress in AI and making it Europe\u2019s most valuable European tech firm.\n\nASML manufactures hardware that manufacturers buy to produce their chips, giving the company a rising tide effect as orders pile up for other semiconductor producers.\n\nMorgan Stanley research, which tracks 277 investment funds worth a combined $1.2 trillion, would suggest that demand has pushed the semiconductor giant into overvalued territory, reaching near the top of the list for stocks among global fund managers.\n\nOverowned stocks are usually regarded as a negative signal, indicating their share price is higher than their underlying market value, and would assume a market correction is likely.\n\nAn AI bubble?\n\nAnalysts have been warning of a bubble for some time as markets defy months of high inflation and rising interest rates, as the S&P 500 rose more than 24% last year.\n\nThe AI sector has become an increasingly important microcosm of this trend.\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock more than tripled in value last year, while a 40% bump this year helped propel the AI chip pioneer above Amazon to become the fourth most valuable company in the U.S.\n\nShares in Softbank-owned U.K. AI darling Arm jumped nearly 50% on the day it released third-quarter earnings that showed surprising levels of demand for its royalty-generating AI technologies.\n\nInvestors have piled their money into the most obvious benefactors of demand for AI, like tech companies and chip producers.\n\nOther sectors may reap the benefits too, with Goldman Sachs\u2019 head of macro research in Europe, Peter Oppenheimer, comparing the buzz to the canal boom of the 18th century.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe hype divided analysts last year, though fears appear to have died down since.\n\nIn August, DeVere Group CEO Nigel Green warned buzz around AI was reaching \"fever pitch\" as Nvidia galloped away.\n\n\u201cThis level of hype is dangerous as it could lead investors to assume that these stocks are a silver bullet to build long-term wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are not, at least not on their own.\u201d\n\nThe other trend that has pushed ASML into \u201coverowned\u201d territory, however, is likely a result of a growing herd mentality among investors in recent years, who have been keen to pile into a stock market that keeps returning huge gains.\n\nFund managers tend to select a collection of high-value stocks in an indexed form, with the stake in each company declining as it falls in value.\n\nThat helped the U.S.\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stock group, including Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla, which carried several S&P 500-tracking funds to positive returns last year.\n\nFor ASML, past trends suggest it could continue to ride this bullish wave for some time.\n\nMarina Zavolock, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief European equity strategist, said: \u201cOverowned stocks are outperforming both the index and underowned stocks since the market lows of October, a typical occurrence in rising markets.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, European funds' largest overweights have seen the best performance among the three fund groups from October lows and this has broadly been a trend since 2017.\u201d\n\nASML loses Samsung\n\nNot everyone is joining the herd and piling into ASML stock, and the company is more likely to be concerned about its business fundamentals than fund managers\u2019 behaviors as a chip war ensues across the globe.\n\nThe group was delivered a blow this week as Samsung announced it was withdrawing its entire 0.4% stake in ASML, Bloomberg first reported citing financial disclosures from the South Korean tech giant.\n\nThe group is also facing a challenge from camera and printer producer Canon, which is hoping to undercut ASML with $150 million chipmaking machines.\n\nShares in the Dutch semiconductor giant have dipped in value by more than 3% in the last week.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "SOXX: This Powerhouse Semiconductor ETF Has More Upside Ahead",
        "content": "The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is up a scorching 56.8% over the past year, but this powerhouse ETF could have plenty of additional upside ahead.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on SOXX based on its strong portfolio of highly-rated semiconductor stocks, the long-term growth prospects of the semiconductor industry, its market-beating performance over the long term, and the fact that many of its components are less expensive than one might expect, given their strong performances.\n\nWhat Is the SOXX ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nSOXX is an index ETF from BlackRock\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) iShares that, according to BlackRock, gives investors \u201cexposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute semiconductors.\u201d\n\nIs It Too Late to Invest in Semiconductors?\n\nWith SOXX\u2019s impressive gain over the past year and the momentum that semiconductor stocks have had in general, many investors may wonder if they are too late to invest in the semiconductor sector. The good news is that while the space has run up quite a bit, the entire industry has plenty of runway for growth ahead. Analysts from McKinsey believe the market could grow by 80% over the course of this decade and reach $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nWhile the growth of generative AI is arguably the most exciting field driving this growth, it\u2019s important to remember that other promising areas like self-driving cars, high-performance computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) will drive further demand for semiconductors as well.\n\nSOXX\u2019s Holdings\n\nAs a directional bet on U.S. semiconductor stocks, SOXX isn\u2019t particularly diversified, and that\u2019s alright. It holds 30 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 60.1% of its portfolio.\u00a0Below is an overview of SOXX\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nSOXX has large positions in its top holdings like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as these stocks are up 239.7%, 121.5%, and 113.9%, respectively, over the past year, helping drive SOXX\u2019s red-hot performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that while these are large positions, SOXX\u2019s exposure to Nvidia is actually quite a bit lower than that of its largest competitor in the semiconductor ETF space, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which features a massive 24.7% position in the AI chip leader. This isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing or a bad thing, but it does take some risk off the table for SOXX compared to SMH in the event that Nvidia\u2019s stock pulls back.\n\nBeyond these leaders in generative AI chips, I like the fact that SOXX includes stocks from all facets of the semiconductor value chain, including semiconductor fabricators and the companies that make the complex equipment and machinery used in the semiconductor manufacturing process, such as Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).\n\nI like this for a few reasons. First, it adds to SOXX\u2019s diversification by bringing in different parts of the semiconductor supply chain to its portfolio.\n\nSecond, these are great stocks that have generated outstanding returns for shareholders over the past year. Applied Materials is up 74.5% over the past year, Lam Research is up 89.1%, ASML is up 43.6%, and Taiwan Semiconductor is up 42.8%.\n\nFurthermore, while these stocks have surged, they aren\u2019t egregiously priced and offer better value than one might expect at first glance. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at 20.2 times consensus 2024 earnings estimates, while Applied Materials trades at 24.5 2024 earnings estimates. While these numbers aren\u2019t cheap, they are roughly in line with the broader market, which is pretty attractive for stocks performing this well.\n\nLam Research and ASML are a bit more expensive, with Lam Research trading at 31.2 times 2024 earnings estimates and ASML trading at 45.6 times estimates.\n\nLastly, these stocks are collectively viewed very favorably by TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor feature \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 Smart Scores, Applied Materials features an Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 9, and Lam Research has a Neutral-equivalent Smart Score of 7.\n\nLooking at the rest of SOXX\u2019s portfolio, an impressive nine of its top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or higher. Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), and the aforementioned ASML all feature 10 out of 10 Smart Scores.\n\nThe Smart Score system also takes a favorable view of SOXX itself, giving it an outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.\n\nScintillating Long-Term Performance\n\nTo put it simply, SOXX\u2019s long-term performance has blown the doors off of the broader market, and it\u2019s not even particularly close.\u00a0As of January 31, SOXX posted outstanding annualized returns of 16.0% over the past three years, 31.1% over the past five, and 24.5% over the past 10.\n\nFor comparison, as of January 31, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) returned 11.0% over the past three years, 14.2% over the past five years, and 12.6% over the past decade.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech-centric Nasdaq (NDX), as represented by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), has returned 20.7% over the past five years and 18.1% over the past 10.\n\nTo be clear, it hasn\u2019t always been a smooth ride, as SOXX has experienced plenty of volatility along the way, but the long-term trend is clearly \u201cup and to the right.\u201d For example, SOXX lost 35.1% of its value in 2022 but followed this up by bouncing back with a 67.1% return in 2023.\n\nWhat Is SOXX\u2019s Expense Ratio?\n\nSOXX\u2019s expense ratio of 0.35% means that an investor in the fund will pay $35 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually. This is the same expense ratio that other popular ETFs like the aforementioned SMH and the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:XSD) charge, which is probably not coincidental as these funds are all competitors.\n\nIs SOXX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SOXX earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on\u00a024 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SOXX stock price target of $666.76 implies 8.5% upside potential.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019m bullish on SOXX based on its market-beating performance over the past decade, its portfolio of highly-rated stocks from across the semiconductor value chain, and the long-term growth prospects of the semiconductor industry. While the ETF has been on a tear, it\u2019s not too late to consider investing in SOXX, and there is room for more upside ahead, as its holdings have strong growth prospects, and many are less expensive than one would expect.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "By Toby Sterling\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Fears that ASML's computer chip equipment will be used for Chinese military ends underlie recent decisions to deny the company export licences, the Dutch trade minister said in answers to questions from parliament.\n\nNetherlands-based ASML, Europe's largest tech firm, dominates the world market for lithography systems, needed by computer chip makers to help create circuitry.\n\n\"China focuses on foreign expertise, including Dutch expertise in the field of lithography, to promote self-sufficiency in its military-technical development,\" Trade Minister Geoffrey van Leeuwen wrote in a Feb. 5 note, seen by Reuters.\n\nVan Leeuwen said that ASML tools are used to make advanced semiconductors that can go into \"high value weapons systems and weapons of mass destruction\" and the Dutch government focuses on \"the risk of undesirable end use\" when reviewing export licensing decisions.\n\nUnder pressure from the United States, the Dutch government last year introduced a licensing requirement for ASML's mid-range DUV machines. The company's most advanced tools have never been sold in China.\n\nThe questions posed by lawmaker Femke Zeedijk of the reformist NSC party asked why the government initially granted, then quickly retracted, a license for ASML to export several tools to undisclosed customers in China. The company has sold hundreds of millions of euros worth of such tools to Chinese customers in recent years.\n\nVan Leeuwen's answers dodged that question, adding that \"several licences for the export to China of advanced semiconductor equipment have been granted\" since the licensing requirement was introduced in September, and it anticipates around 20 such requests this year.\n\nThat is in line with forecasts by industry group SEMI, which says around 18 Chinese chip plants will come on line this year, more than in any other geographical region.\n\nSome of Zeedijk's questions, such as whether the Netherlands had revoked the licenses at the request of the U.S. government, went unanswered.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I'm not saying that there are no security issues or that this decision was wrong, but I would like to be better informed,\" Zeedijk told Reuters on Monday.\n\n\"The perception is also that besides the security risk, that there are also economic reasons behind it.\"\n\nASML confirmed on New Year's Day the Dutch government had revoked a licence, following a report by Bloomberg News.\n\nThe resulting cancellations did not impact ASML's fourth quarter earnings, but the Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) tools in question cost approximately $60 million each and would be an important part of customer plans.\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Susan Fenton)",

        "title": "5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "While the hype hit new heights over the past year, artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for a while and the enthusiasm is here to stay. Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) estimates that the generative AI market could grow 40%-plus annually and reach $1.2 trillion by 2032. That level of growth will also create an estimated $280 billion in new revenue opportunities from software alone.\n\nEmerging new industries are exciting, but picking the long-term winners can be challenging. For all investors know, the most prolific company of the next 20 years might not even exist yet. That suggests casting a wide net could be the best investment strategy. In this case, the best approach might be to find the early winners, own their stocks, and follow how AI progresses over time.\n\nAfter pouring through dozens of companies, these five stood out for their strong positions to lead the industry's growth. Consider buying and holding these AI stocks. They enjoy pole positions in the AI industry and could generate life-changing investment returns over the next decade and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia: This company owns an estimated 90% of the AI chip market\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) might seem like it became Wall Street's hottest trend overnight. Seemingly just as quickly, graphics chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has taken a stranglehold on the market for chips used to power AI models (it controls as much as 90% of the market). One of its competitors, Advanced Micro Devices, estimates the AI chip market will grow to $400 billion over the next several years. Do the math, and Nvidia's companywide revenue of $45 billion over the past year looks poised to skyrocket.\n\nThe competition will chase Nvidia, but the company's high-performance chips, combined with its popular CUDA computing software optimized to get the most out of them, create a turnkey package the industry keeps opting for. Perhaps Nvidia's competitors weren't ready for the AI surge. Shares have gained over 230% this past year alone, but the long-term demand for AI chips seems poised to drive the stock even higher as Nvidia grows.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. ASML: Manufacturing cutting-edge chips relies on this one manufacturer\n\nIronically, most chip companies, including Nvidia, don't build their chips. They only design them. Chip factories, called fabs, do the building and require cutting-edge machines to make intricate patterns on silicon wafers. ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) designs and builds extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, which are used to create the most advanced chips hitting the market today.\n\nRemarkably, ASML is the only company that makes this type of machine. This machine is so complex that it takes 13 shipping containers and 250 crates to ship and costs up to $400 million each. Naturally, AI and general technology will continue progressing. Breakthroughs will require increasingly better machines to make better chips. ASML should be a long-term beneficiary of the AI boom.\n\n3. Palantir: Enterprises are flocking to use this company's custom software applications\n\nBig technology companies are spending to build advanced computer systems, but smaller enterprises want to use AI technology to help run their businesses. Because of this, Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is seeing growth take off. The company sells custom software applications built on three proprietary platforms: Gotham, Foundry, and AIP. Specifically, AIP was designed for building and deploying AI in commercial applications.\n\nPalantir gets over half its revenue from government customers, the U.S. government being its largest and oldest customer. However, the commercial segment is thriving. Palantir's enterprise customer base grew 55% year over year in the fourth quarter and 22% over the previous three months to 221. That's just a couple of hundred companies in a broader corporate landscape of millions. If companies worldwide need AI to compete, Palantir could grow for years.\n\n4. Supermicro: Turnkey server systems are in high demand, and this company is heating up\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), better known as Supermicro, has evolved from selling components to complete IT solutions over the decades. However, the explosion of data center demand for AI is beginning to reach Supermicro, and the business is taking off. The company's revenue growth has accelerated, and management believes its total revenue will double this fiscal year (ending over the summer).\n\nAgain, its success makes sense. Companies need AI capabilities, but non-technical businesses are far better off hiring a third party like Supermicro to come in and build a system for them. The modular design makes it easier to expand the system if their computing needs grow over time. Management estimates they're growing five times faster than the broader industry, meaning customers choose them over others. It's promising for Supermicro's long-term trajectory and shareholders alike.\n\n5. Microsoft: Its partnership with ChatGPT's creator is a potential goldmine\n\nThe AI hype may have begun with ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot built by OpenAI. Tech giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) jumped on the opportunity and furthered its partnership with OpenAI, tying OpenAI's growth to its cloud platform, Azure. That has already bore fruit. Microsoft reported an uptick in Azure's growth in its latest quarter, noting that over half the Fortune 500 already uses Azure and OpenAI in their businesses. Azure is the world's second-leading cloud platform, only trailing Amazon's AWS.\n\nBut with Microsoft, you get a diversified business with revenue streams from cloud, gaming, enterprise software, and more. Its massive size and deep pockets also give it a higher floor than most stocks you'll come across. Of course, a $3.1 trillion market cap means it's probably too large to make you a millionaire alone. Instead, expect a steady portfolio performer that generally grinds higher over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "ASML (ASML) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this equipment supplier to semiconductor makers have returned +29.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry, to which ASML belongs, has gained 26.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, ASML is expected to post earnings of $2.85 per share, indicating a change of -46.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -37.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.42 points to a change of -5.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.64 indicates a change of +40.3% from what ASML is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ASML.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor ASML, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.73 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -20.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.39 billion and $37.57 billion estimates indicate +2% and +23.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nASML reported revenues of $7.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $5.60 for the same period compares with $4.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.2%. The EPS surprise was +9.38%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nASML is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ASML. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- ASML Holding NV said the semiconductor market has reached its nadir and there are now are signs of a rebound.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Says Putin Can\u2019t Lose in Ukraine, Opposes Senate Bill Wall Street Caught Off Guard by \u2018Sticky\u2019 CPI Signs: Markets Wrap StanChart Weighs Break Up of Corporate, Investment Bank Putin Seeks Revenge on a World Order He Once Wanted to Join Lyft Corrects Earnings Margin Gain to 50 Basis Points From 500\n\n\u201cWe believe that the market has now reached the lowest point of the dip,\u201d ASML Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen said in comments in the company\u2019s 2023 annual report published on Wednesday. \u201cAlthough we cannot predict the exact nature of the slope ahead, the recovery is nascent.\u201d\n\nASML is the world\u2019s top maker of lithography systems, machines that perform a crucial step in the process of creating semiconductors. The demand for its products is a bellwether for the industry, even as chipmakers including Intel Corp., Texas instruments Inc. and Infineon Technologies AG have warned of subdued sales this year.\n\nThe Veldhoven-based company is the only producer of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that are used by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel for the most advanced fabrication. The equipment prints patterns of transistors onto silicon wafers, which are then sliced into individual chips.\n\nASML\u2019s sales are dominated by these three companies. While it doesn\u2019t disclose its top buyers, its largest customer bought \u20ac8.78 billion ($9.4 billion) of equipment in 2023, or 32% of its total net revenue. Last year, 54% of ASML\u2019s total net sales were made to two customers.\n\n\u201cThe longer-term trends are unmistakable,\u201d Dassen said, citing artificial intelligence, electrification and the energy transition as boons to ASML\u2019s business.\n\nThe company last quarter received record orders for its top-of-the-line EUV machines, boosting optimism for the industry which had been hit by inflation and recession fears last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML also benefited from strong demand from China last year as chipmakers there rushed to get lithography machines ahead of export controls meant to hobble Beijing\u2019s semiconductor ambitions. The rise in Chinese demand helped offset the effects of a global chip industry slowdown on ASML.\n\nRead More: ASML\u2019s China Sales Surged Despite Secret Dutch Deal With US\n\nASML recently unveiled its latest chipmaking machine.

        "content": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ASML, the largest supplier of equipment to computer chip makers, said on Wednesday that geopolitical tensions and any expansion of a U.S.-led campaign to restrict its exports to China remain business risks.\n\nIn its annual report published on Wednesday, the Dutch company flagged the growing list of restrictions imposed by the United States, mostly with the assent of the Dutch government.\n\nThose include Dutch licensing requirements for most of ASML's advanced product lines, as well as a unilateral move by the U.S. in October 2023 to restrict exports of older equipment to unspecified Chinese plants.\n\n\"The list of Chinese entities impacted by export control restrictions has increased since 2022,\" the company wrote.\n\n\"The list of restricted customers and the scope of the restrictions are subject to change.\"\n\nIn January, it said it expects U.S. and Dutch export curbs to reduce sales of its mid-range \"DUV\" product lines to China by about 10% to 15% this year, after they hit record levels in 2023.\n\nFollowing a U.S.-led campaign to slow Beijing's technological and military advances, ASML has been restricted from selling its most advanced EUV tool line in China since 2019 and has never sold an EUV tool there.\n\nFor its part the Chinese government has been subsidizing domestic chip-making in a bid for self sufficiency, as it is a huge importer of chips for its own market and for its manufacturing industries.\n\nASML dominates the market for lithography systems, machines used to help create circuitry in one key step of the chip-making process.\n\nIn 2023, while many chipmakers were slowing orders amid an industry slump, China passed South Korea to become ASML's second largest market, representing 26.3% of sales, with Taiwan remaining its largest at 29.3%.\n\nASML noted that its list of competitors is growing beyond traditional rivalries with Canon and Nikon of Japan in its older core business, and non-lithography U.S. firms Applied Materials and KLA Corp..\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We also face competition from new competitors with substantial financial resources, as well as from competitors driven by the ambition of self-sufficiency in the geopolitical context.\"\n\nShanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's best known maker of lithography machines.\n\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; editing by Miral Fahmy)",

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have become popular in recent months. The gains in some AI names have become eye-popping as investors and consumers become increasingly aware of the possible productivity gains these stocks can drive.\n\nNonetheless, long-term investors tend to seek stocks that will not rise and fall as trends come and go. Instead, they probably want to look to companies that operate sustainable businesses that could potentially drive AI-driven profits for decades. To this end, investors may want to consider positions in AI stocks such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML).\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet has been an AI pioneer. Its use of AI goes back to 2001, when it applied machine learning (ML) technology to correct the spelling of those using Google Search. Its use of AI increased steadily from that point, and the company declared itself an \"AI first\" company in 2016, when it fully committed to incorporating AI into its products and services.\n\nHowever, many observers began to doubt its AI prowess in 2023, when OpenAI released an upgraded version of ChatGPT. Given OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft, some investors feared that Google Search would face serious competition for the first time in years.\n\nNonetheless, that fear appears overblown. Alphabet has released a generative AI tool of its own called Gemini, which it bills as its most capable AI tool yet. Moreover, it stays ahead of the curve through Google DeepMind, its enterprise for developing general-purpose AI. Additionally, with liquidity of $111 billion, the company can afford to build or buy the technology it needs to stay competitive.\n\nFurthermore, while advertising still made up 76% of company revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, Google Cloud's growth now outpaces Google Advertising. That growth should accelerate AI development across the enterprise.\n\nWhether the focus is advertising or other segments, Alphabet continues to grow at a respectable pace. Its $307 billion in revenue in 2023 grew 9% yearly. Also, since it kept a lid on cost and expense growth, the $74 billion in net income grew 23% over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, for all the talk about Alphabet falling behind, the stock rose by more than 35% over the last year. Also, since its P/E ratio of 25 gives it the lowest earnings multiple among the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, now is likely an excellent time to add shares of the search giant.\n\n2. ASML\n\nASML calls itself \"the most important tech company you've never heard of.\" It is an equipment manufacturer that enables the production of the world's most advanced semiconductors through its extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology.\n\nIts clients include chip industry heavyweights such as Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Intel, and the manufacturing capabilities of these companies are not possible without the type of equipment ASML provides. And thanks to ASML's technical lead, peers such as Lam Research and Applied Materials are less of an option for chip manufacturers.\n\nAdditionally, powerful tailwinds now drive the stock. With demand for AI chips on the rise, manufacturers need more ASML equipment. Also, companies are scrambling to manufacture less in Taiwan. With billions in government subsidies available to add capacity in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, ASML is one of the primary beneficiaries.\n\nFurthermore, ASML prices its machines as high as $400 million per unit. Thus, clients will invest heavily in maintaining these machines. To this end, around 20% of net sales in 2023 came from service and field option sales. Such maintenance costs serve as a recurring source of revenue that can sustain ASML through slower sales periods.\n\nOverall, net sales in 2023 reached almost 28 billion euros ($30 billion), 30% more than in 2022. While costs and expenses increased nearly as rapidly as revenue, net profits rose by 39% over the same period to 7.8 billion euros ($8.4 billion).\n\nNonetheless, it seems more investors are finally hearing of ASML. Over the last year, the semiconductor stock is up more than 35%, with nearly all of that gain occurring in 2024. Moreover, while its P/E ratio of 43 may seem elevated, it is close to historical averages.\n\nUltimately, that growth trend should bode well for ASML's shareholders. As the need for chips grows, manufacturers are likely to keep turning to ASML to maintain their development pipeline.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

ASML shares \u2014 which dropped as much as 7.1% just after opening on Tuesday \u2014 went into a trading halt due to volatility just after the open, lasting three minutes.\n\nIn the first minute of the session, 28,558 shares traded between \u20ac858.20 and \u20ac815.60, with only 110 shares trading at the day\u2019s lowest price before the stock was halted. It resumed trading at \u20ac853.40 after an auction.\n\nUS inflation figures for January are likely to show disinflation has spread from goods to services, according to Bloomberg Economics. US stocks futures are lower as traders wait on how the data will impact expectations for interest-rate cuts this year.\n\nEven with Tuesday\u2019s decline, ASML is up 24% so far in 2024, giving it a market capitalization of \u20ac335 billion ($361 billion). The Stoxx 600 Technology Index, which has gained 9.6% year-to-date, is on track for its first decline in nine sessions after Monday\u2019s close at the highest level in more than 23 years.

        "title": "3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for the Upcoming AI Wars",
        "content": "Last month, the writers at InvestorPlace.com and I recommended four stocks to buy for the coming \u201cAI Wars.\u201d Governments worldwide know that artificial intelligence has incredible potential, and everyone is racing to come out ahead.\n\nThe United Kingdom has promised to pour $1.3 billion over the next five years into AI and supercomputing, while China will put in double that amount. If you include government subsidies of chip factories (the most capital-intensive part of AI investment), roughly $120 billion has now been pledged.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing the effects of this new AI nationalism. Since January, shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) \u2014 one of the four stocks we highlighted last week \u2014 have surged 45% on strong fourth-quarter earnings. The secretive company specializes in helping corporations and governments eke out AI-driven insights from mounds of data. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of Louis Navellier\u2019s top picks, has risen 45% since the start of the year after tripling the prices of its AI-focused H100 flagship processors. U.K.-based AI chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is up almost 60% after earnings\u2026 the list goes on.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn other words, these companies are raising prices and creating monopolies\u2026 and governments are happy to allow it.\n\nOf course, some AI stocks will take time to play out. Last Friday, shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) (another of our four picks from last week) fell 12% after the chipmaker announced a weaker-than-expected forecast. It will likely take one or two more years for Intel to see the benefits of the billion-dollar subsidies the U.S. government is providing.\n\nNevertheless, this much is clear: When governments and investors all want a sector to succeed, the combination of supporting tariffs, subsidies and lax regulation can often make it so. We\u2019ve seen this before in other industries\u2026 from shale oil and gas drilling in the Dakotas to electric vehicle production in China\u2019s Anhui province. Once a state begins putting its thumb on the scale, those favored industries have little choice but to succeed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis week, Luke Lango reveals another group of stocks in The AI Endgame. During that event, Luke will tell us all about the final phase of the AI Revolution, which could send several unknown stocks soaring to new heights\u2026 while simultaneously erasing thousands of stocks from the markets. You can sign up to reserve your spot for that event \u2014 Tuesday, Feb. 13, at 8 p.m. Eastern \u2014 here.\n\nAnd in the meantime, our writers here at InvestorPlace.com have chosen three blue-chip stocks to help keep you ahead as these AI Wars continue to escalate.\n\n3 Blue Chip AI Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerhaps the clearest potential winner of AI nationalism will be Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google. The company launched its answer to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT on Wednesday, and our initial tests suggest it\u2019s even better than GPT-4.\n\nThis comes as much-needed good news for the search giant. Digital ad revenues have been slowing for years, and Google has become increasingly reliant on its cloud computing business for growth. A strong showing by its new AI product \u2014 Google Gemini \u2014 will help it push past rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It\u2019s one of the reasons why David Moadel, one of InvestorPlace\u2019s top contributors, believes that Alphabet is a Mag 7 bargain:\n\n\u201cThere no denying that Alphabet is committed to developing the latest and greatest in AI tech\u2026 [and] agree with Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali, who asserts that Alphabet \u201cremains at the forefront of the AI race.\u201d All three of the analysts mentioned here assigned a \u201cbuy\u201d rating to GOOG/GOOGL stock.\n\n\u201cMy forecast GOOG stock is 100% bullish and I encourage investors to grab some shares before the next long-term rally commences.\u201d\n\nAI nationalism is also particularly important for Alphabet because it has the most to gain from lax regulation. Google has the broadest access to online data of any major tech firm, having indexed the web for the past 25 years. Many publishers also give Google the ability to \u201ccrawl\u201d content behind paywalled sites \u2014 a privilege that virtually no other firm has.\n\nThat makes Google the most likely company to beat ChatGPT \u2014 provided it can use the data it\u2019s collected. Studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) continue improving as more training data is added. So, a hands-off approach by regulators will be essential to helping Google win.\n\nOf course, other American blue-chips will also benefit from favorable regulation. Export restrictions to China will eventually turn into import restrictions, protecting companies like Nvidia from cheaper Chinese rivals. Microsoft and Amazon will both find themselves protected from trustbusters because regulators recognize that AI is only as good as the massive amounts of data it hoovers up.\n\nBut AI will benefit Google the most, given the company\u2019s awkward reliance on a slowing search business and the amount of data it has. Alphabet is also the cheapest of the Magnificent 7 stocks, trading at only 21 times forward earnings. If the company manages to beat OpenAI, a renewed surge of growth gives the search giant a 50% to 60% upside from here.\n\n2.

The Netherlands-based company had found itself caught in the China-U.S. fight over chip export restrictions, and shares lost as much as 25% going into the fall. Regulators knew that ASML served as the lynchpin of advanced semiconductor manufacturing, so they banned sales of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) chipmaking machinery to kneecap China\u2019s growing chipmaking business.\n\nHowever, Western governments have since realized that choking off ASML\u2019s business entirely is a bad idea. Roughly a quarter of ASML\u2019s total operating costs come from its R&D department, and ASML needs to keep innovating to stay ahead of the competition. Subsequent export restrictions have since been watered down to include only the latest models.\n\nThat\u2019s had a predictable effect on earnings estimates and share prices. Analysts have been nudging their 2024-2025 estimates up across the board, and shares have risen over 50% since October. It\u2019s why InvestorPlace.com\u2019s Chris MacDonald continues to recommend shares of this impressive firm.\n\n\u201cASML\u2019s top position in EUV technology is critical for semiconductor advancement, especially in advanced memory solutions. CEO Peter Wennink maintained a humble outlook despite positive signs of a 2024 revenue similar to the previous year. The company sets eyes for significant growth in 2025.\u201d\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany Chinese firms will win thanks to AI nationalism. The Chinese government has a $40 billion state fund to boost the semiconductor industry, and dozens of chipmaking firms have sprung up to take advantage of the handouts. Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor, Nexchip Semiconductor and United Nova are among these names.\n\nHowever, the \u201csafest\u201d of Chinese AI plays is most likely Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), a monopolistic software giant with few strong competitors. Unlike Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Tencent has remained on the right side of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Its CEO has never \u201cdisappeared\u201d for months on end. And Tencent has been far better managed than Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), China\u2019s top search-engine company, which failed to recognize opportunities in cloud computing. Tencent has masterfully navigated M&A deals across the greater China region, earning north of 20% returns.\n\nMost importantly, Tencent has no stake in the cut-throat world of semiconductor manufacturing. The company focuses on mobile games, online chat, enterprise businesses, music streaming and other high-margin tech services that AI will make even more profitable. Analysts expect the firm to earn 30% operating margins going into 2024. (SMIC, by comparison, barely covers its cost of capital.)\n\nThe Chinese tech giant also has significant exposure to cloud computing, business services, and fintech, which fits neatly into its AI ambitions. In 2022, this segment eclipsed its gaming sales, and analysts see this as a significant growth area for the next several years. Josh Enomoto at InvestorPlace.com sees at least 34% upside from current prices, while a successful pivot to AI would mean even more.\n\nOf course, Tencent comes with the broader risks of buying Chinese stocks. The country has recently seen an exodus of investors, driven out by fears of real estate contagion and a rapidly decelerating economy. The tech firm also remains beholden to the whims of the CCP; in December, Tencent\u2019s shares fell double-digits after Chinese regulators announced a wide range of rules aimed at curbing spending on video games. (The CCP would later fire a top government official over the resulting market meltdown, sending Tencent\u2019s shares back up.)\n\nStill, Paul La Monica sees this most recent drawdown as an opportunity to buy Chinese shares cheaply. He notes that insiders have recently snapped up shares.\n\n\u201cThe reported stock purchases by Ma and Tsai are certainly a sign of confidence and could suggest that Alibaba and the overall Chinese stock market have bottomed. Investors are also growing increasingly optimistic about the possibility of more stimulus from Beijing. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that a nearly $280 billion market stabilization package is in the works, where state-owned financial companies would buy up local shares of Chinese stocks.\u201d\n\nAnd now that even Chinese President Xi Jinping is attempting to calm investors, this likely marks as the best time in years to buy shares of Tencent.\n\nThe New AI Wars\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve talked about the large companies helped by direct government intervention. These are essentially the equivalent of the South Korean family-run conglomerates (chaebol), or the eight conglomerates of Japan. Dependable and protected\u2026 but with somewhat limited upside because of their size.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke has ventured further to find the secondary winners of this new AI reality. Though his research, he\u2019s found incredible growth companies that are leading innovation, even without much government help. Many of these firms could even rival the big players someday. And to get you started, Luke releases a new report this week that outlines five 1,000% winners for The AI Endgame.

        "title": "3 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without Any Hesitation",
        "content": "Many tech stocks soared over the past year as the bullish enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware, software, and chips broadly offset the bearish concerns about high interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds.\n\nBut with the Nasdaq Composite now hovering near an all-time high, some investors might be reluctant to add more tech stocks to their portfolios. However, I believe it's still safe to buy more shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), ASML(NASDAQ: ASML), and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) as the bears fret over a potential downturn. Here's why I would buy these three supercharged tech stocks without hesitation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the world's largest social media company, lost its luster in 2022 as Apple's privacy changes for iOS, fierce competition from ByteDance's TikTok, and macro headwinds curbed the growth of its core advertising business. At the same time, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs business. During that challenging year, its revenue and earnings per share declined 1% and 38%, respectively.\n\nBut in 2023, Meta's revenue rose 16% as its earnings jumped 73%. Its advertising business recovered as Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies ramped up their spending on Facebook and Instagram, it revamped its algorithms to counter Apple's iOS changes, and it expanded Reels to keep pace with TikTok's short videos. That recovery indicated Meta could continue subsidizing Reality Labs' costly expansion with its higher-margin advertising revenue.\n\nTo top it all off, Meta ended the year with enough cash to initiate its first-ever dividend and boost its existing buyback plan by $50 billion. Analysts expect Meta's revenue and earnings to grow 19% and 31%, respectively, in 2024. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 24 times forward earnings -- so investors shouldn't hesitate to buy Meta right now, even as it trades slightly below its all-time highs.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. ASML\n\nASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems for manufacturing the world's smallest and densest chips.\n\nASML's dominance of that crucial chipmaking technology makes it a linchpin of the global semiconductor market. Its revenue rose 30% in 2023 as the world's top foundries installed more EUV systems, but it expects its revenue to stay nearly flat in 2024 as tighter export restrictions throttle its sales to Chinese chipmakers. Analysts expect its revenue to stay flat and for its earnings to decline by 4%.\n\nBut looking ahead, ASML expects to generate \"significant growth\" in 2025 as PC sales stabilize, the smartphone market warms up, and it ramps up shipments of its next-gen \"high-NA\" EUV systems for the production of even smaller chips. For 2025, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 24% and 45%, respectively.\n\nASML's stock might seem a bit pricey at 43 times forward earnings, but its dominance of the lithography market justifies that higher valuation. Investors who are bullish on the semiconductor market should still buy this stock hand over fist.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom sells a wide range of wireless, optical, data storage, networking, mobile, and industrial chips. It also expanded into the infrastructure software market over the past six years by acquiring CA Technologies, Symantec's enterprise security division, and the cloud software giant VMware.\n\nBroadcom still generated a fifth of its revenue from Apple over the last two fiscal years. However, its acquisition of VMware last November -- which boosts its software business to about half of its top line -- should significantly reduce its dependence on the iPhone maker. It should also reduce its overall exposure to the cyclical semiconductor sector and make it a more diversified tech giant.\n\nAnalysts expect Broadcom's revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 40% and 10%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 (which ends in October) as it integrates VMware. In fiscal 2025, they expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to rise 11% and 20%, respectively, as it laps that acquisition and its integration expenses. Those are robust growth rates for a stock that trades at 27 times forward earnings and pays a forward yield of 1.7%. Investors looking for a stable tech play that offers balanced exposure to the semiconductor, infrastructure software, and cloud markets shouldn't hesitate to buy Broadcom stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "4 Phenomenal Companies That Will Be Massive Winners, Regardless of Who Wins the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Arms Race",
        "content": "Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be overwhelming, as many companies benefit from this trend. Whether it's a company deploying AI to improve its business or one that makes AI software, there are a lot of opportunities.\n\nHowever, there are also hardware components of AI, and many of these companies will be winners regardless of what happens to individual companies. I've pinpointed four that will be massive winners over the coming years.\n\n1. ASML\n\nA microchip is at the core of every computer used to create an AI model. These components require highly specialized machinery to make them, and one of the key suppliers in this realm is ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). The company makes lithography machines, which make the conductive traces on chips.\n\nSemiconductors have reached the point where the distance between these traces is as small as 3 nanometers (nm). For reference, the human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide. With smaller distances between traces, these chips become more powerful and efficient -- a key need for any device.\n\nASML currently holds a technological monopoly in this space, as no other companies make EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines. If you're making cutting-edge chips, you must work with ASML. As a result, ASML will be a huge winner in this space.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is a huge user of these machines. The company is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, which means it makes chips for other clients.\n\nTSMC is a leader in this field, as it has 3-nm chips but is also developing 2-nm chips slated to launch in 2025. Taiwan Semiconductor's innovative culture is always working on the next thing, which will provide continual revenue boosts as these new products launch.\n\nAmong Taiwan Semiconductor's customers are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and AMD, which provide another critical component in the AI value chain.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has probably received the most attention in this group, as its best-in-class GPUs (graphics processing units) are crucial in AI. GPUs are used to process vast amounts of data and train AI models, making them must-have hardware.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen a business outfits a computer to train these models, they don't just buy one or two GPUs; they buy thousands. This caused Nvidia's revenue to explode higher in 2023, as the demand for its GPUs was unprecedented. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nNvidia's strength will continue as long as AI is a massive trend, as it requires a significant computing infrastructure buildout.\n\n4. Super Micro Computer\n\nYou can't just go out and buy a few thousand Nvidia GPUs filled with Taiwan Semiconductor chips made with ASML's lithography machines, hook them up, and expect a positive result. Instead, a specialized server is needed to maximize efficiency so a business can get the most performance out of its supercomputer.\n\nThat's where Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) comes in. Supermicro specializes in server design, whether it's being used for engineering simulations, drug discovery, or AI model training. Its products are highly configurable, whether a company wants a couple of hundred GPUs or a couple of thousand.\n\nAs the demand for AI computers reaches the general market, Supermicro will continue to excel, which is part of the reason the stock is up around 140% to start in 2024.\n\nA basket of AI winners\n\nYou don't have to pick a single winner to be a successful AI investor. Instead, you could select a variety of stocks that are critical suppliers in the AI field and likely do quite well.\n\nThis group will be successful regardless of which company produces the best AI product, as they provide the building blocks necessary for all AI models.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 best big company stocks to buy. To skip the latest news and analysts\u2019 sentiments around the current economic conditions, go directly to the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.\n\nDespite the doubts, the market performed exceptionally in 2023. While several analysts believed it to be temporary, the new year isn\u2019t showing many signs of weakness in the market. Although there have been a few hurdles, the overall prediction is that the Federal Reserve will manage to guide the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession, as was expected in the last two years. However, analysts still advise caution in the short term. Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, said:\n\n\u201cAs we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the latest news suggests that the financial markets are heading in the right direction as the S&P 500 touched 5000 for the first time at the time of market opening on February 9 after December inflation data, which turned out to be even lower than initially reported. While the Fed recently revealed that it will take its time to review market data before making any decision to announce rate cuts, many analysts believe that the rate cuts can begin in the first half of 2024.\n\nDespite the positive predictions around the market, the varying opinions of experts can lead to further confusion among novice investors, which is why the best big company stocks are some of the safest bets for such people. These big company stocks bring a sense of safety among investors as the losses are never permanent, even during bear market conditions. Additionally, the best company stocks are usually cash-rich with strong balance sheets and can easily weather any economic disasters. Furthermore, their wealth also allows them to pay steady dividends. For example, one of the giants in the energy sector, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has increased its dividends for the last 37 years, even though the last 10 years have seen some significant volatility in the energy sectors. Similarly, another blue-chip stock, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its dividend by 7% on February 9 despite year-over-year (YoY) revenue declines across major markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe big company stocks do not guarantee positive returns all the time but provide ample opportunities for investors when they fall. For example, earlier this month, we discussed the 10 blue-chip stocks at 52-week lows, which you should check out as these are also some of the best big company stocks that provide prime entry points for investors. However, our current list uses a different methodology, and some of our current best big company stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). After an exceptional performance in 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on February 1 and increased its previous share buyback authorization by $50 billion. The company nearly gained 200% in the year and is up nearly 36% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on February 9. 13 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy\n\nA large stock market board displaying the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Growth Index.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo choose the best big company stocks, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify mega-cap stocks with an estimated 5-year EPS growth of over 15%. These stocks were then listed according to the number of their hedge fund investors in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund sentiment was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 910 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest Big Company Stocks to Buy\n\n13. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Dutch company that manufactures and distributes semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\n\nOn January 24, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) announced an interim dividend of EUR 1.45 per share, which is payable by February 14.\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the best big company stocks to buy, along with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nClearBridge Investments stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAnother welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture, which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.\n\nOn an individual stock basis, the largest contributors to absolute returns in the quarter included ASML and Tokyo Electron in the IT sector.\u201d\n\n12. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a New Jersey-based company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets prescription medicines, vaccines, animal health products, etc.\n\nOn February 5, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced that it would buy the aqua business from Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE:ELAN) for $1.3 billion in cash. The deal is expected to be finalized by mid-2024, and the company will get two manufacturing facilities in Canada and Vietnam and a research facility in Chile as part of the deal.\n\nOn February 1, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced its Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.03, topping the estimates by $0.14. The revenue of the quarter grew by 6% YoY to $14.6 billion, surpassing the estimates by $120 million.\n\nCarillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) underperformed in the third quarter, based on what we view as largely macroeconomic-related factors. The company continues to execute well, both clinically and fundamentally, but much of the biopharmaceutical industry has been weak as investors are gravitating to other, more cyclical sectors.\u201d\n\n11. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a North Carolina-based company that offers various services, including wealth management services, credit and debit cards, and more.\n\nOn January 30, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck upgraded Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\u2019s stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and increased the price target to $41 from $32.\n\nOn January 31, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.24, payable by March 29 to the shareholders of record on March 1. At the time of writing on February 9, the stock\u2019s dividend yield was 2.91%.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database that tracks 910 elite hedge funds, 88 hedge funds had investments in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\u2019s stock in the third quarter. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway was the most significant stakeholder in the company and owned 1.03 billion company shares worth $28.28 billion.\n\n10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a California-based company that provides subscription video-on-demand over-the-top streaming service in more than 190 countries.\n\nOn January 26, Argus raised the price target on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s stock to $660 from $575 and maintained a Buy rating. Highlighting the company\u2019s Q4 results, the analyst mentioned the company\u2019s emphasis on stopping password-sharing, an advertising-supported service plan, and more.\n\nOn January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) posted its Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11. The revenue of $8.83 billion jumped 12.5% YoY, which beat the analysts\u2019 estimates by $120 million.\n\nPolen Capital mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cIn the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.\n\nDuring Netflix\u2019s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user\u2019s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.\n\nFast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\n9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an Indiana-based company that discovers, develops, and markets human healthcare products.\n\nOn February 6, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) posted its Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $2.49, which beat the estimates by $0.12. The revenue of $9.35 billion grew 28.1% YoY, topping the estimates by $380 million.\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was mentioned in Baron Funds\u2019 fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cStock selection was also positive in the sub-industry owing to strong gains from therapeutics-focused pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly\u2019s stock continued to outperform driven by strong sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company\u2019s obesity and diabetes franchises, particularly after Novo Nordisk released its SELECT trial results showing a 20% relative risk reduction in overweight patients with cardiovascular disease and no prior history of diabetes.\n\nEli Lilly and Company is a global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells medicines in the categories of diabetes, oncology, neuroscience, and immunology, among other areas. Stock performance was strong due to strong third quarter sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company\u2019s obesity and diabetes franchises. We continue to think Lilly is well positioned to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.\n\nWe own Eli Lilly and Company, which we believe will remain a leader in the GLP-1 medicine class with Mounjaro, Zepbound, and the company\u2019s deep pipeline of next generation GLP-1 medicines.\u201d\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a California-based company that develops and sells semiconductor products and devices.\n\nOver the last three months, 34 Wall Street analysts covered Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and 29 maintained a Buy rating on the shares. At the time of writing on February 9, the average price target of $194.16 represented an upside of 12.79%.\n\nIn the third quarter, 110 hedge funds held a stake in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s stock, compared to 112 hedge funds in the previous quarter, but the total stake value increased to $9.156 billion in Q3, up from $6.93 billion in Q2. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management was the top investor in the company, with 27.768 million shares worth $2.855 billion.\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover \u2013 performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get \u2018lucky\u2019 investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).\u201d\n\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in\u00a0 Omaha, Nebraska. Through its subsidiaries, it offers various services like freight rail transportation, finance, and more. Most of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)\u2019s revenue is generated from its insurance business.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, hedge fund sentiment was positive toward Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in the third quarter, as 116 hedge funds had investments in the stock, up from 109 in the prior quarter.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is our seventh best big company stock to buy.\n\n6. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a California-based company that offers customer relationship management software and applications to customers worldwide. With 122 hedge fund investors, the company occupies the sixth spot on our list.\n\nOn January 23, Baird analyst Rob Oliver increased the price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s stock to $310 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are some of the best big company stocks to buy, besides Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nPolen Capital stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Highest-Paid Women CEOs 12 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds 10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "By Toby Sterling\n\nVELDHOVEN, Netherlands (Reuters) - Chip toolmaking giant ASML said on Friday it was gearing up production of its new $350 million \"High NA EUV\" machine, a device the size of a double decker bus central to its bid to keep its lead in a $125 billion market.\n\nThe machine, which went on display for the first time on Friday in the Dutch headquarters of Europe's largest tech company by market value, is aimed at Intel and other makers of the highest-end semiconductors.\n\nASML said it was expecting to ship \"a number\" of them this year, and there was still work to do on customising and installation.\n\n\"We keep engineering and developing and there's a lot of work to be done to calibrate it and make sure it fits into the manufacturing system,\" ASML spokesperson Monique Mols said. \"There's also a steep learning curve for us and our customers.\"\n\nASML is the only maker of a key technology - extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography - needed to manufacture the most advanced chips.\n\nHigh NA EUV is the next generation of that technology.

        "content": "The Russell 2000 (^RUT) has been trading at a generally flat range for the past 2 years, but the small-cap index has started to consolidate and begin to break out from its pattern over the past few months.\n\nThe chip sector continues to see massive gains as stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) climb higher year-to-date.\n\nYahoo Finance reporter Jared Blikre joins the Live show to break down all the latest trends and movements in the stock market and put all the important numbers into context.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: And we are more than just about an hour, an hour and 15 minutes into the trading day. We got to get back to the markets here. The S&P hovering right around that 5,000 level, just above that level here. That's so critical here. We'll see whether or not we are able to close above that milestone.\n\nFor a closer look at some of the trends that we're seeing, Jared Blikre is standing by at the big board for us. Jared?\n\nJARED BLIKRE: That's right, Seana. We'll see if we can get that close. In the meantime, tech is leading in the Dow. That's in negative territory. But the NASDAQ composite up 86 basis points, the Russell 2000 up a little bit less than that.\n\nAnd I want to focus on the Russell 2000 for a minute. This is a three-year chart. And you can see over the last two years, roughly, been trading in a very flat range, very sideways. And it's frustrated a lot of traders. Over the last three months, though, we have been consolidating in this pennant formation. And we are just now breaking to the upside.\n\nIf we close there, that will be a mild breakout. The reason I mention this, we've had some of the smaller indexes like the Russell 2000, also the transports not confirming the very bullish action that we're seeing in other markets, including tech, including the Dow industrials themselves.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the Dow transports here trying to break through that three-month high. I'll put you-- show you a three-year chart. You can see we've had higher highs in there. But for the most part, this is a very sideways market as well.\n\nWell, let me show you a market that is not going sideways. This is the NASDAQ 100. Put a line chart on here. Only yesterday did we break to the upside for the first time. Now, this is a NASDAQ 100 equal weighted. If you're looking at the NASDAQ regular weighted, that would be market cap weighted, where you have all the big names like Apple, weighted more according to their size.\n\nYou can see this broke to the upside quite strongly. And that was late last year. But then you go down the tech sector. You take a look at the Fang index. This is largely correlated to the Mag Seven. This is even more bullish than the NASDAQ 100.\n\nAnd then you take a look at the semiconductors. That's a similar situation as well. And I've been tracking the semiconductors. It's not just NVIDIA. It's a whole slew of them. By the way, this is a sector action that's tech and the number one spot, followed by consumer discretionary.\n\nBut let's stick with the semiconductors here. NVIDIA at another record high. That's probably going to happen most days. At least, it has happened most days that I've seen.\n\nThe Taiwan Semi here, this is an interesting stock. It's down a little bit today. But here it is on a three-year basis. And it is right up against these highs that we've seen. Here's a five-year. And you can see it's threatening to take out this top right here.\n\nThis was a pretty big M top. But this is thoroughly completed that pattern. And now, we are in an upward trend with higher highs and higher lows. We have approached these levels very quickly. So I do expect a little bit of a pause before being able to break through, if that happens. But nevertheless, looking pretty bullish there.\n\nAnd I was also taking a look at ASML. This is a stock that just recently broke to its own new record highs. And just looking at the techs semiconductor space, overall, in the year, let me pull up the year-to-date figures for you.\n\nAnd you can see NVIDIA, number two next to Super Micro Computer. That's up 161%. But look at Taiwan Semi, ASML, each up more than 24% more than AMD. So the chip sector all around is just on fire, guys.\n\nSEANA SMITH: It certainly has had a tremendous start to this year. Jared, thanks so much for bringing that down for us.",

        "content": "In the ever-changing world of finance, investors seek various avenues for long-term profitability. A mix of growth and dividend stocks can offer the desired mix for many investors. Top growth stocks provide the sort of viable long-term cash flow potential investors want, while dividend-paying companies offer relative stability within a portfolio.\n\nNow, with the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, all eyes are on growth stocks. Investors seeking exposure to high-growth names may be doing so when valuations are near all-time highs in certain sectors.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t good reason for this valuation level. Some companies, like a few of the stocks I\u2019ve listed here, are expensive for a reason. However, investors should take a measured approach to these stocks and consider their fundamentals before diving in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that said, here are three of the top growth stocks I think investors should consider precisely for their fundamentals.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML), a lithography systems market champ, had a sluggish 2023 but came back in Q4, achieving nearly 13% year-over-year net sales growth. The company holds impressive metrics and a significant backlog of 39 billion euros.\n\nASML\u2019s top position in EUV technology is critical for semiconductor advancement, especially in advanced memory solutions. CEO Peter Wennink maintained a humble outlook despite positive signs of a 2024 revenue similar to the previous year. The company sets eyes for significant growth in 2025.\n\nAMSL Holdings shares skyrocketed nearly 10%, reaching a peak driven by substantial Q4 earnings and a robust order backlog, indicating a recovery in the computer chip market. The Dutch company\u2019s market capitalization outdid \u20ac300 billion. Q4 net profits increased by 9% to \u20ac2 billion on sales of \u20ac7.2 billion, surpassing analyst forecasts.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has seen some rather incredible results of late. The company\u2019s third-quarter earnings report showed a 96% increase in operating profitability, and an all-time best in terms of margins at 22% delivered. This significant improvement in fundamentals underscores CrowdStrike\u2019s ability to grow at scale while maintaining its profitability.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s balanced long-term approach towards growth and profitability positions it for long-term success. This philosophy is further highlighted in the company\u2019s new target models, driving year-over-year improvement in subscription gross margins from 82% to 85%, operating margins from 28% to 32%, and free cash flow margins from 34% to the new 38%. Investors gain confidence from these targets that the company will maintain growth.\n\nIn the the long-term, investors seeking exposure to the cybersecurity space will continue to favor fundamentally-strong companies capable of gaining market share profitably. Currently, CRWD appears to be a premier way to play this space, and has captured my attention as a top growth stock.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW IPO)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmid market cyclicality, Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) has been a relatively strong performer. Similar to many top growth stocks, SNOW stock has yet to reach its all-time highs from the previous bull market rally. However, on a one-year basis, Snowflake is among the top-performing cloud stocks in the market, and has captured my attention.\n\nMuch of this recent improvement is closely tied with Snowflake\u2019s AI integrations. The narrative around artificial intelligence is expected to persist, providing benefits to companies that can leverage this technology to enhance their growth prospects. One such company, Snowflake, is positioned to benefit from this trend, combined with the already high interest around cloud computing technology.\n\nI believe Snowflake is currently trading below its intrinsic value, with a decent margin of safety. This view is bolstered by analyst forecasts projecting 33% annual profit growth in the coming years. These factors, all things being equal, should contribute to increased cash flow and enhanced share value over time.\n\nAs a hyper-growth company succeeding in cloud data, Snowflake has captured the attention of Warren Buffett and his team as a key tech stock. Despite a lofty valuation multiple of 26 times sales, the company positions itself as a top growth stock. If Snowflake continues to generate market-beating growth over the next five years, the current valuation could prove to be justified.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Bulls Just Got a Great Piece of News From ASML",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a popular investment trend, but there are many ways to cash in on this generational shift. Whether it's a software application, cloud computing to collect data, GPUs to power these data centers, or the companies that make the microchips, investors have a wide range of choices.\n\nHowever, only one company is essentially a supplier for every company in the AI value chain: ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). Fortunately for investors, ASML just reported excellent news, making the AI trend seem more alive than ever.\n\nASML machines make cutting-edge chip technology possible\n\nASML makes lithography machines that etch the microscopic patterns on microchips. Its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines are the most powerful in the world and are used by semiconductor manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor to produce high-performing, energy-efficient chips as small as 3 nanometers.\n\nASML has created its next-generation high-NA EUV machines. These machines are slated to unlock new capabilities in a manufacturing setting, and ASML is slated to ship the first one to Intel.\n\nThis machine is huge news for ASML investors, as it shows that it's continuously innovating to keep anyone else trying to develop this technology at bay. ASML has no real competition right now, as it's the only one in the world that has produced EUV lithography machines. This gives ASML a technological monopoly -- a rare occurrence in today's competitive landscape. Image source: ASML.\n\nContinuous innovation also spurs chipmakers to continue buying ASML's products, as they, too, must innovate to win business. With the most powerful chips needed to efficiently crunch data to create AI models, ASML will benefit from this arms race.\n\nASML is quite expesnive right now\n\nThese EUV machines are massive and incredibly expensive, making ASML's results quite lumpy, as a few machines more or less sold in any given quarter versus the next can skew results. In Q4, ASML sold eight more machines than in Q3, bringing its total sales for the period to 113. In 2023, it sold 421 versus 317 in 2022. While those aren't massive production figures, the sheer cost of these machines makes up for it (its new machines are projected to cost over 270 million euros each).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q4, ASML generated 7.2 billion euros in revenues, which also includes income from managing its installed base and selling used machines. Its net bookings came in at 9.2 billion euros.\n\nOne notable comment from management in the conference call was that 2024's sales are expected to be the same as 2023's. This is counterintuitive since one would expect its sales to be rising due to demand in the AI field. However, management said that 2024 will be a \"transition\" year, and 2025 will be a year of strong growth.\n\nSo, if you're an ASML investor, you must stay patient with the company. With the stock up over 15% year to date, a fair share of investor enthusiasm has already been seen.\n\nThe stock is also quite pricey right now, trading for about 41 times earnings. ASML PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis places ASML in high valuation territory, but it has consistently delivered even when it reached these levels.\n\nSo, am I saying to buy ASML stock today? No.\n\nI think ASML will be a huge winner in this space, which may warrant buying some shares. However, I believe the market will eventually become impatient with ASML and sell off the stock, which is when I'll buy it. This may never occur, and I may miss a big winner in ASML, but I don't want to overextend myself by purchasing an incredibly expensive stock with so many other values in the market right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ASML wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Terrific Rally? Buy This Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Before It Goes on a Bull Run.",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia have shot up 206% in the past year as the massive demand for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) chips triggered rapid growth in its top and bottom lines.\n\nThat rally has also lifted the broader semiconductor sector, as shown by the 49% gain in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index in the past year. But not all components of the index have benefited equally. ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) is one such example.\n\nShares of the Dutch chipmaking equipment company have jumped only 32% in the past year, underperforming the index and Nvidia by a big margin. But all that could change very soon -- ASML stock shot up nearly 9% after the company released its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan. 24. Let's see why Wall Street gave those results a big thumbs-up.\n\nAI has helped ASML regain its mojo\n\nASML finished 2023 with total revenue of 27.5 billion euros ($29.8 billion), up 30% over the previous year. Its fourth-quarter revenue of $7.84 billion, however, increased at a slower 12% over the prior year.\n\nThe good news was that ASML's top line exceeded the $7.43 billion consensus estimate. The company's earnings of $5.64 per share were also well ahead of the $5.16 Wall Street predicted.\n\nThe slower year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter can be attributed to the slowdown in semiconductor equipment spending last year, which is estimated to have been 15% lower. This explains why ASML saw a decline in orders in 2023. The company's net bookings, which refers to all the system sales orders for which it has received written authorizations, fell to $21.7 billion from $33.2 billion in 2022.\n\nWhat's more, management adopted a cautious approach on guidance. The company expects 2024 revenue to remain at last year's levels, which means that its growth could drop sharply this year.\n\nThat cautious guidance could be attributed to the drop in orders last year, but ASML adds that there are \"positive signs\" in the semiconductor industry and the company is witnessing an improvement in utilization levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is evident from the sharp increase in ASML's orders in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company received net bookings worth $10 billion in the fourth quarter, a huge jump from $2.8 billion in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe year-over-year growth in bookings was 46%. Analysts would have settled for net bookings worth just $3.9 billion, but ASML knocked it out of the park with a substantially stronger order book.\n\nThe reason behind this significant outperformance is simple: AI. The company's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines are used for manufacturing chips based on advanced process nodes, allowing chipmakers to produce\u00a07-nanometer (nm), 5nm, and 3nm chips.\n\nThe demand for these advanced chip nodes, especially 5nm and 3nm, is booming thanks to AI. That's because chips manufactured using these smaller process nodes carry more computing power and are more power efficient -- ideal for AI workloads.\n\nNvidia, for instance, is expected to move to a 3nm manufacturing node for its next-generation H200 data center GPUs (graphics processing units) in 2024. Its new GPU is expected to have more than double the performance of the current H100, which is manufactured on an advanced 5nm node.\n\nWith the demand for AI chips predicted to increase at an annual rate of 38% through 2032, according to Allied Market Research, chipmakers are aggressively placing orders for ASML's EUV lithography machines.\n\nThe company received $6.1 billion worth of orders for its EUV machines last quarter, which was 60% of the total orders. On a year-over-year basis, EUV bookings jumped 65% from $3.7 billion in the 2022 fourth quarter. The demand for ASML's EUV machines could increase further as the AI chip market gains momentum.\n\nInvestors should also note that ASML exited 2023 with a massive order backlog of $42.3 billion, which is more than the company's 2024 revenue forecast. So, it won't be surprising to see ASML outpacing its prediction and delivering stronger growth this year.\n\nASML is also expecting to achieve \"significant growth\" from 2025 following this year's flat performance, which explains why analysts have substantially raised their forecasts for the next two years. ASML Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nBuying the stock is a no-brainer right now\n\nASML is a much cheaper AI bet when compared to Nvidia right now. ASML is trading at 11 times sales and 40 times trailing earnings. These multiples are lower than Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 34 and trailing earnings multiple of 81. ASML's forward multiples are lower than Nvidia's readings as well. NVDA PS Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nHowever, ASML might not be available at such attractive multiples in the future given the increase in the company's AI business, its impressive backlog, and the sharp jump that analysts are expecting in its revenue from next year.\n\nThat's why investors looking to buy an AI stock that's cheaper than Nvidia right now, but one that could go on a bull run, should consider buying ASML while it is still trading at relatively affordable levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ASML wasn't one of them.
