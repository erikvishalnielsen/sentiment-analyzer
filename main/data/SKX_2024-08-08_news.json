        "title": "Hanesbrands (HBI) Trims FY24 View Despite Q2 Earnings Beat",
        "content": "Hanesbrands Inc. HBI reported mixed second-quarter 2024 results, with the top line declining year over year and missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure and surpassed the consensus mark. Challenges in the consumer and apparel market hurt results. Management lowered its net sales and earnings view for 2024.\n\nQ2 in Detail\n\nThe company posted adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 15 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which was pegged at 10 cents. The metric increased from 2 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nNet sales from continuing operations declined nearly 4% to $995 million and came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,350.6 million. The metric includes an impact of nearly 130 basis points (bps) from the U.S. Hosiery divestiture and almost 150 bps from unfavorable currency rates. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, organic net sales inched down nearly 1%. Macroeconomic headwinds in Australia caused the downside. Improved innerwear sales in the\u00a0United States somewhat offset this.\n\nHanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nHanesbrands Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Hanesbrands Inc. Quote\n\nAdjusted gross profit came in at $396 million, up 11% year over year. The adjusted gross margin was 39.8%, up nearly 525 bps and exceeding our anticipation of 38.9%. The year-over-year improvement can be attributed to reduced input costs, as it continues to benefit from the effects of peak inflation receding and ongoing cost-saving measures.\n\nAdjusted SG&A expenses stood at $270 million, flat year over year. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted SG&A expenses increased by 100 bps to 27.1%. This increase was largely due to a 125 bps rise in brand marketing investments within the U.S. innerwear segment. However, it was partially mitigated by cost-saving measures and careful expense management.\r\n\r\nAdjusted operating profit came in at $126 million, up 46% year over year. Adjusted operating margin stood at 12.7%, up 430 bps. We had expected adjusted operating profit and margin to be $122.2 million and 9%, respectively.\n\nSegmental Details\n\nStarting with second-quarter 2024, HBI reorganized its reporting segments into U.S. and International categories.\r\n\r\nU.S. Segment: The segment\u2019s net sales dropped 1% year over year. Despite the anticipated market downturn this quarter, the company\u2019s consumer-centric strategy proved effective. Hanesbrands captured an additional 40 bps of innerwear market share, driven by increased marketing investments and innovations in its Hanes, Maidenform and Bali brands. These efforts led to gains in retail space, attracted younger consumers and produced point-of-sale trends that outpaced the market. The segmental operating margin was 21.4%, up almost 470 bps.\r\n\r\nInternational Segment: International net sales fell by about 4% on a reported basis, which includes a $15-million impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates. At cc, international sales rose 2% year over year, with growth in the Americas and Asia outweighing the anticipated macroeconomic-driven decline in Australia. The operating margin improved to 12%, up nearly 380 bps and driven by reduced input costs and the advantages of cost-saving measures.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Financial Details\n\nThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $213.8 million, long-term debt of $3,224.2 million and total stockholders\u2019 equity of $64.4 million. It had more than $1 billion of available capacity under its credit facility at the end of the quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter, the company registered $78 million in net cash from operating activities. Free cash flow was $71 million in second-quarter 2024.\r\n\r\nOn Jun 5, 2024, the company announced a definitive agreement to sell the global Champion business to Authentic Brands Group (ABG), with the transaction expected to be finalized in the second half of 2024.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor 2024, net sales from continuing operations are anticipated to be $3.59-$3.63 billion, including anticipated headwinds of almost $50 million from the U.S. Hosiery divestiture and a currency headwind of nearly $40 million. The midpoint of the guidance suggests an almost 4% year-over-year decline on a reported basis and an approximately 2% decline on an organic basis at cc. Earlier, net sales from continuing operations were anticipated to be $5.35-$5.47 billion.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdjusted operating profit from continuing operations is likely to be $395-$415 million, including a currency headwind expectation of approximately $9 million. The metric was expected to be in the range of $500-$520 million. \r\n\r\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations are envisioned to be 31-37 cents compared with 42-48 cents expected earlier. Cash flow from operations is forecast to be nearly $200 million, while capital investments are estimated to be almost $50 million.\r\n\r\nFor third-quarter 2024, net sales from continuing operations are expected to be $920-$950 million, including anticipated headwinds of almost $17 million from the U.S. Hosiery divestiture and a currency headwind of nearly $4 million.

        "title": "After Plunging -10.52% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why the Trend Might Reverse for Skechers (SKX)",
        "content": "A downtrend has been apparent in Skechers (SKX) lately with too much selling pressure. The stock has declined 10.5% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.\n\nHere is How to Spot Oversold Stocks\n\nWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.\n\nRSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.\n\nTechnically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.\n\nSo, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.\n\nHowever, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.\n\nHere's Why SKX Could Experience a Turnaround\n\nThe heavy selling of SKX shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 29.74. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand. 3-month RSI Chart for SKX\n\nThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering SKX in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 2.3% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.\n\nMoreover, SKX currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

        "content": "V.F. Corporation VFC reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although the company\u2019s sales and earnings declined year over year, it noted improvements sequentially. The company\u2019s fiscal first-quarter results reflected sequential revenue improvements across all its brands. Moreover, VFC is on track with its Reinvent program and expects to deliver on its cost-saving target.\r\n\r\nV.F. Corp reported an adjusted loss per share of 33 cents compared with a loss of 15 cents in the prior-year quarter. However, the bottom line was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents.\r\n\r\nNet revenues of $1.9 billion declined 9% year over year and 8% in constant currency. However, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.8 billion.\r\n\r\nThe gross margin contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 52%. This was driven by a 60-bps adverse rate impact, which includes negative transactional foreign currency, and a 20-bps impact of an unfavorable mix.\r\n\r\nThe company reported an adjusted operating loss of $76.6 million compared with an adjusted operating loss of $7.9 million in the year-ago period.\r\n\r\nDriven by the better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, shares of V.F. Corp. rose 6.9% in the after-hours trading session on Aug 6. Investors seem to be optimistic about sequential growth witnessed in the quarter and the forward guidance. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's shares have rallied 30.6% in the past three months against the industry\u2019s 16% decline. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRevenue Details\n\nOn a regional basis, revenues in the Americas declined 12% year over year on both reported and constant-currency basis. The company noted that the decline softened sequentially from the 23% fall reported in the last quarter. In the EMEA region, revenues fell 5% on both reported and constant-currency basis. Revenues in the APAC region dropped 3% on a reported basis and improved 2% in constant currency. The company\u2019s international revenues were down 5% year over year on a reported basis and 3% on a constant-currency basis.\r\n\r\nChannel-wise, wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenues were down 8% and 10%, respectively, year over year on a reported basis. In constant currency, revenues declined 7% for the wholesale business and 9% for the direct-to-consumer channel. Our model estimated the wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenues to fall 7.6% and 12.2% year over year, respectively, for the fiscal first quarter.\r\n\r\nBased on reporting segments, revenues in the Outdoor segment dipped 5% year over year on a reported basis and 4% on a constant-currency basis to $790.2 million. In the Active segment, revenues of $942.1 million declined 12% year over year on a reported basis and 11% on a constant-currency basis. Revenues in the Work segment dropped 8% year over year on both reported and constant-currency basis to $175 million.\r\n\r\nOur model predicted first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to decline 4%, 15% and 6% year over year, respectively, for the Outdoor, Active and Work segments. In constant-currency, revenues were expected to be down 5%, 16% and 7%, respectively, for the Outdoor, Active and Work segments.\n\nStory continues\n\nV.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise V.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nV.F. Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | V.F. Corporation Quote\n\nFinancial Details\n\nV.F. Corp ended first-quarter fiscal 2025 with cash and cash equivalents of $637.4 million, long-term debt of $3.9 billion, and shareholders\u2019 equity of $1.4 billion. Inventories declined 24.3% year over year in first-quarter fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nIn first-quarter fiscal 2025, VFC generated cash from operating activities of $19.8 million. It returned $35 million to shareholders through dividend payouts in the fiscal first quarter. The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 9 cents per share, payable Sep 18, 2024, to shareholders of record as of Sep 10.\n\nOther Updates\n\nV.F. Corp remains on track with its Reinvent transformation program focused on brand-building and improved operating performance. The key points include improving North America results, delivering the Vans turnaround, lowering costs and reinforcing the balance sheet. The company continues pursuing opportunities to streamline its processes and invest in the business to drive brand demand and boost growth.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Reinvent targets, VFC initiated an in-depth strategic review of the brand assets within the portfolio to ensure it owns the brands that create the greatest long-term value.\r\n\r\nIn first-quarter fiscal 2024, the company generated cost savings of $50 million through the Reinvent program. V.F. Corp targets generating about $300 million in cost savings from the program in the first half of fiscal 2025. These savings will be fully reflected in the company\u2019s profit and loss statement in fiscal 2025.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor second-quarter fiscal 2025, management expects the revenue trend to show a modest improvement from the fiscal first quarter.

For the North Face, the company expects to report a slight sequential decline in the revenue growth rate from that recorded in the fiscal first quarter. Notably, VFC reported 17% growth year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nThe company anticipates the gross margin to increase slightly year over year in the fiscal second quarter. It expects SG&A expenses to be up slightly year over year in the fiscal second quarter, led by increased spending for the holiday season and reinvestments in its business, offset by Reinvent savings, and normalized incentive compensation and inflation.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2025, V.F. Corp reiterated its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, including proceeds from non-core physical asset sale. The company expects the Supreme divestiture to be completed by the end of the calendar year 2024.\n\nEye These Solid Picks\n\nSome better-ranked companies are Wolverine World Wide WWW, Kontoor Brands KTB and Skechers SKX.\r\n\r\nWolverine is engaged in the designing, manufacturing and distribution of a wide variety of casual and active apparel and footwear.

        "content": "Investors in Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 17, 2025 $20.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Skechers shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Skechers is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Shoes and Retail Apparel industry that ranks in the Top 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of $1.11 per share to $1.15 in that period.\r\n\r\nGiven the way analysts feel about Skechers right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.\r\n\r\nClick to see the trades now >>\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc.\u2019s SKX strategic focus on product diversification, digital enhancement and international expansion has positioned it for sustained growth and market leadership.\n\nBy investing in omnichannel capabilities, infrastructure and global market penetration, Skechers effectively meets evolving consumer preferences while achieving significant gains across wholesale and direct-to-consumer (DTC) segments. These efforts underscore its commitment to reaching ambitious sales targets and strengthening its industry presence.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has demonstrated remarkable market performance over the past year, significantly outpacing the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry. Over this period, SKX's shares rose 9.5% against the industry\u2019s 32.7% decline. This performance highlights the company's robust market strategies and resilience during challenging economic conditions. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s Delve Deeper\n\nSkechers is strengthening its position in the footwear industry with a diverse brand portfolio, covering fashion, athletic, non-athletic and work footwear. This multi-brand approach allows new product introductions without affecting the existing lines, thereby catering to a broad customer base. The focus has shifted toward comfort-based footwear and apparel to meet the rising demand for relaxed styles.\n\nThe company is investing in global infrastructure, including retail stores, e-commerce platforms and distribution centers, to enhance omnichannel capabilities and expand its DTC business. Key digital initiatives include improved website features, mobile apps and loyalty programs, along with upgraded point-of-sale systems to boost customer engagement.\r\n\r\nSkechers is optimistic about the continued growth of its wholesale segment throughout fiscal 2024. This optimism is supported by consistent product demand and strategic investments in logistics and retailer relationships.\n\nIn the second quarter, SKX reported a 5.5% year-over-year increase in wholesale sales, reaching $1.13 billion. This upside was driven by a 14% increase in domestic wholesale sales, fueled by double-digit growth in men and kids\u2019 footwear, as well as gains in women\u2019s footwear.\r\n\r\nThe DTC segment of Skechers showcased strong performance, with sales climbing 9.2% year over year to $1.03 billion. This growth highlights the effectiveness of Skechers' strategies to enhance direct consumer engagement and improve the retail experience. International DTC sales rose 15.2%, while domestic sales saw a modest 1.4% increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nRobust International Business\n\nSkechers' international operations play a vital role in its overall growth trajectory. The company's success in global markets highlights its ability to adapt to varied consumer preferences, seize emerging trends and implement effective distribution strategies tailored to each region's unique characteristics.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter, international sales grew 6.9%, representing 60% of the company's total revenues, thus emphasizing the importance of its global presence. The EMEA region stood out with a notable 13.7% year-over-year increase in sales, while the APAC region and China demonstrated strong performance with growth rates of 2.2% and 3.4%, respectively.\n\nPromising Outlook\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Skechers forecasts sales to be between $8.88 billion and $8.98 billion, up from the earlier guided range of $8.73-$8.88 billion. This indicates a rise from $8 billion in fiscal 2023. It predicts earnings per share to be between $4.08 and $4.18 compared with the previously projected range of $3.95-$4.10. This implies growth from $3.49 per share registered in the last fiscal year.\r\n\r\nSkechers plans to allocate between $325 million and $375 million for capital expenditure. This investment will support key strategic initiatives, including store openings, omnichannel capability expansion and distribution infrastructure enhancements. The company is on track to achieve its ambitious goal of $10 billion in annual sales by 2026.\n\nZacks Estimates\n\nAnalysts have responded positively to Sketcher\u2019s prospects, reflected in upward revisions to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share. In the past seven days, analysts have increased their estimates for the current quarter by 4 cents. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.15 per share. The estimate for the next quarter has also been raised by 7 cents to 76 cents per share.\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, Skechers is poised to continue its growth trajectory and meet its ambitious targets with substantial investments in infrastructure, technology and international markets. As it progresses, the company's focus on improving the customer experience and expanding its global presence will be crucial in sustaining its competitive advantage and providing long-term value to shareholders.\n\nOther Key Picks\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks are The Gap, Inc.

        "title": "Are Investors Undervaluing Skechers (SKX) Right Now?",
        "content": "The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.\n\nConsidering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.\n\nZacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.\n\nOne stock to keep an eye on is Skechers (SKX). SKX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 14.31 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 20.89. Over the last 12 months, SKX's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.15 and as low as 11.91, with a median of 15.17.\n\nSKX is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.83. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. SKX's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.51. Over the past 52 weeks, SKX's PEG has been as high as 1.23 and as low as 0.43, with a median of 0.58.\n\nFinally, investors should note that SKX has a P/CF ratio of 13.06. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 16.77. Over the past year, SKX's P/CF has been as high as 14.79 and as low as 10.16, with a median of 12.98.\n\nThese figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Skechers is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, SKX feels like a great value stock at the moment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 August 1, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Crocs CROX, Deckers Outdoor DECK and Skechers SKX.\n\nApparel Earnings: Will Consumer Strength Fuel Crocs?\n\nWe\u2019ve got a stacked earnings schedule this week, with nearly every pocket of the economy being represented.\n\nAmong the bunch is a consumer-facing company \u2013 Crocs. Shares have been red-hot in 2024, gaining more than 40% and regularly boosted by quarterly results. But can the company deliver again?\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at a few results from other consumer-facing companies, including Deckers Outdoor and Skechers, as a light guide.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Posts Robust Results\n\nDeckers Outdoor posted a strong quarter, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations handily and continuing its streak of earnings positivity. EPS grew a staggering 90% year-over-year, whereas sales shot 22% higher from the year-ago period.\n\nContinued brand momentum among UGG and Hoka shoes aided the robust results, leading the company to up its current fiscal year outlook. Analysts have updated their outlook for the company\u2019s current fiscal year accordingly following the print, with the $31.52 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company has also been enjoying margin expansion, aiding its profitability picture nicely. And it enjoyed the same throughout its latest release, with its gross margin expanding to 56.9% vs 51.3% in the year-ago period.\n\nSkechers Sees Strong DTC Growth\n\nSkechers didn\u2019t see the same positive reaction to its quarterly release, with the company seeing a 7% EPS decline on a 7% sales increase. Both items missed relative to Zacks Consensus estimates, snapping a long streak of positive surprises.\n\nStill, sales of $2.2 billion reflected a quarterly record, with its Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) sales improving an impressive 9.2% year-over-year. The DTC sales growth is undoubtedly positive, reflective of a healthy market position.\n\nLike DECK, Skechers enjoyed margin expansion throughout the period thanks to lower freight and lower costs per unit, reporting a gross margin improvement of 220 basis points to 54.9%. The company\u2019s margins have been historically strong.\n\nPositive revisions for its current fiscal year hit the tape following the print, with the stock carrying a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nCrocs Looks to Build on Record Sales\n\nEstimates for CROX\u2019s upcoming release have remained stable, with earnings expected to be down 2% on 2.5% higher sales. It\u2019s worth noting that the stock popped following its latest set of quarterly results thanks to a guidance upgrade, with sales of $940 million reflecting a quarterly record.\n\nStory continues\n\nContinued brand momentum led to its latest guidance upgrade, with its Crocs brand showing 15% year-over-year sales growth throughout the period. And like both companies above, the company enjoyed margin expansion throughout the period, further exciting investors and boosting post-earnings gains.\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nApparel favorite Crocs is gearing up to unveil its quarterly results this week, building on recent reports from other consumer-facing companies such as Deckers Outdoor and Skechers.\n\nBoth Deckers Outdoor and Skechers posted overall positive results, reporting continued brand momentum and margin expansion. DECK upped its guidance, leading to its positive post-earnings reaction. SKX didn\u2019t see much positivity following its respective release, but shares have remained stable and so have earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to expect that Crocs has continued to enjoy margin expansion given favorable reads from DECK and SKX, with Crocs\u2019 record quarterly sales in its latest release also alluding to underlying brand momentum.\n\nGiven its favorable earnings outlook and recent brand momentum, the stock remains a prime selection for investors, and a post-earnings dip could certainly be bought if the company provides favorable guidance that keeps the earnings estimate revisions trends positive.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "We\u2019ve got a stacked earnings schedule this week, with nearly every pocket of the economy being represented.\n\nAmong the bunch is a consumer-facing company \u2013 Crocs CROX. Shares have been red-hot in 2024, gaining more than 40% and regularly boosted by quarterly results. But can the company deliver again?\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at a few results from other consumer-facing companies, including Deckers Outdoor DECK and Skechers SKX, as a light guide.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Posts Robust Results\n\nDeckers Outdoor posted a strong quarter, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations handily and continuing its streak of earnings positivity. EPS grew a staggering 90% year-over-year, whereas sales shot 22% higher from the year-ago period.\n\nContinued brand momentum among UGG and Hoka shoes aided the robust results, leading the company to up its current fiscal year outlook. Analysts have updated their outlook for the company\u2019s current fiscal year accordingly following the print, with the $31.52 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has also been enjoying margin expansion, aiding its profitability picture nicely. And it enjoyed the same throughout its latest release, with its gross margin expanding to 56.9% vs 51.3% in the year-ago period.\n\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSkechers Sees Strong DTC Growth\n\nSkechers didn\u2019t see the same positive reaction to its quarterly release, with the company seeing a 7% EPS decline on a 7% sales increase. Both items missed relative to Zacks Consensus estimates, snapping a long streak of positive surprises.\n\nStill, sales of $2.2 billion reflected a quarterly record, with its Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) sales improving an impressive 9.2% year-over-year. The DTC sales growth is undoubtedly positive, reflective of a healthy market position.\n\nLike DECK, Skechers enjoyed margin expansion throughout the period thanks to lower freight and lower costs per unit, reporting a gross margin improvement of 220 basis points to 54.9%. The company\u2019s margins have been historically strong, as illustrated below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPositive revisions for its current fiscal year hit the tape following the print, with the stock carrying a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCrocs Looks to Build on Record Sales\n\nEstimates for CROX\u2019s upcoming release have remained stable, with earnings expected to be down 2% on 2.5% higher sales. It\u2019s worth noting that the stock popped following its latest set of quarterly results thanks to a guidance upgrade, with sales of $940 million reflecting a quarterly record.\n\nStory continues\n\nContinued brand momentum led to its latest guidance upgrade, with its Crocs brand showing 15% year-over-year sales growth throughout the period. And like both companies above, the company enjoyed margin expansion throughout the period, further exciting investors and boosting post-earnings gains. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nApparel favorite Crocs CROX is gearing up to unveil its quarterly results this week, building on recent reports from other consumer-facing companies such as Deckers Outdoor DECK and Skechers SKX.\n\nBoth Deckers Outdoor and Skechers posted overall positive results, reporting continued brand momentum and margin expansion. DECK upped its guidance, leading to its positive post-earnings reaction. SKX didn\u2019t see much positivity following its respective release, but shares have remained stable and so have earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to expect that Crocs has continued to enjoy margin expansion given favorable reads from DECK and SKX, with Crocs\u2019 record quarterly sales in its latest release also alluding to underlying brand momentum.\n\nGiven its favorable earnings outlook and recent brand momentum, the stock remains a prime selection for investors, and a post-earnings dip could certainly be bought if the company provides favorable guidance that keeps the earnings estimate revisions trends positive.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Skechers (SKX) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Skechers (SKX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nSkechers currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.08, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.08 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.7% and 8.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SKX Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for SKX\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Skechers here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Skechers, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in SKX?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Skechers, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2.3% over the past month to $4.16.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Skechers. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Skechers may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Enhancing e-commerce platforms and expanding partnerships with major online retailers are the key initiatives of the company.\u00a0\r\n\r\nG-III Apparel aims to boost global brand awareness and sales by transforming its North American retail business with significant marketing investments and adding more than 2,500 points of sale.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nLOS ANGELES, July 30, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Skechers expanded its all-star roster of athletes with Los Angeles Sparks forward Rickea Jackson. The WNBA\u2019s first-round draft pick joined Team Skechers after practicing in Skechers Basketball shoes and experiencing the brand\u2019s signature Comfort That Performs.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to be the first WNBA player to join forces with Skechers,\" shared Rickea Jackson. \"While Skechers is a new player in the basketball world, their commitment to fit, support, and active collaboration with athletes is clear. The comfort and design of their footwear is truly impressive. I love training in these shoes and I'm eager to see what we can accomplish together.\"\n\n\"So we can give each player the attention they deserve, our roster of professional basketball athletes is tight and focused with veterans like 2022-2023 MVP Joel Embiid and three-time NBA All-Star Julius Randle, as well as rising stars with exceptional talent like LA Clippers shooting guard Terance Mann.

Another new style, the SKX Reign\u2122 that promotes elevation and intense traction, will also deliver for the 2024-2025 season.\n\nRickea Jackson played college basketball at Mississippi State and University of Tennessee where she was named first-team All-SEC in 2023 as a senior. As a freshman at Mississippi State in 2020, Jackson also earned a second-team All-SEC and received the Gillom Trophy as the top women\u2019s college player in Mississippi. Jackson was selected by the Los Angeles Sparks as the number-four overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Skechers team of elite athletes competing in the brand\u2019s performance footwear includes NBA players Joel Embiid, Julius Randal and Terance Mann; elite footballers Harry Kane, Mohammed Kudus, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Anthony Elanga, as well as many others; golfers Matt Fitzpatrick and Brooke Henderson; pickleball pros Tyson McGuffin and Catherine Parenteau; and Major League Baseball players Clayton Kershaw, Chris Taylor, Brendan Donovan, Aaron Nola, and Wade Miley.\n\nSkechers Basketball footwear is available at skechersbasketball.com and select Skechers retail stores in North America, as well as select retailers and Skechers stores in the Philippines and China, with a global roll out planned for August 2024.

        "content": "Investors interested in stocks from the Shoes and Retail Apparel sector have probably already heard of Skechers (SKX) and Birkenstock (BIRK). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nSkechers and Birkenstock are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), respectively, right now. This means that SKX's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nSKX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.55, while BIRK has a forward P/E of 41.89. We also note that SKX has a PEG ratio of 0.91. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. BIRK currently has a PEG ratio of 1.65.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for SKX is its P/B ratio of 2.19. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BIRK has a P/B of 3.88.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to SKX's Value grade of B and BIRK's Value grade of F.\n\nSKX sticks out from BIRK in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that SKX is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "International Markets and Skechers (SKX): A Deep Dive for Investors",
        "content": "Did you analyze how Skechers (SKX) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending June 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this shoe company, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\n\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\n\nParticipation in global economies acts as a defense against economic difficulties at home and a pathway to more rapidly developing economies. However, it also comes with the complexities of dealing with fluctuating currencies, geopolitical risks and different market dynamics.\n\nWhile delving into SKX's performance for the past quarter, we observed some fascinating trends in the revenue from its foreign segments that are commonly modeled and observed by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter stood at $2.16 billion, increasing 7.2% year over year. Now, let's delve into SKX's international revenue breakdown to gain insights into the significance of its operations beyond home turf.\n\nDecoding SKX's International Revenue Trends\n\nDuring the quarter, Asia Pacific contributed $564.2 million in revenue, making up 26.2% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $620.98 million, this meant a surprise of -9.14%. Looking back, Asia Pacific contributed $604.5 million, or 26.9%, in the previous quarter, and $552.2 million, or 27.4%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nEurope, Middle East & Africa generated $492.5 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 22.8% of the total. This represented a surprise of +9.02% compared to the $451.77 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Europe, Middle East & Africa accounted for $627.6 million (27.9%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $433.3 million (21.5%) to the total revenue.\n\nProspective Revenues in International Markets\n\nThe current fiscal quarter's total revenue for Skechers, as projected by Wall Street analysts, is expected to reach $2.22 billion, reflecting an increase of 9.4% from the same quarter last year. The breakdown of this revenue by foreign region is as follows: Asia Pacific is anticipated to contribute 26.6% or $589.76 million and Europe, Middle East & Africa 23.4% or $519.43 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the full year, the company is projected to achieve a total revenue of $8.86 billion, which signifies a rise of 10.8% from the last year. The share of this revenue from various regions is expected to be: Asia Pacific at 28.1% ($2.49 billion) and Europe, Middle East & Africa at 22.9% ($2.03 billion).\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nSkechers' leaning on foreign markets for its revenue stream presents a mix of chances and challenges. Therefore, a vigilant watch on its international revenue movements can greatly aid in projecting the company's future direction.\n\nIn an era of growing international ties and escalating geopolitical disputes, financial analysts on Wall Street pay keen attention to these developments to fine-tune their earnings estimations for businesses operating across borders. It's important to note, however, that a range of additional variables, like a company's local market status, also play a crucial role in shaping these forecasts.\n\nAt Zacks, a company's changing earnings outlook is given considerable attention due to its proven, strong influence on a stock's price performance in the near term. The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool - the Zacks Rank - harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions and serves as an effective indicator of a stock's near-term price performance.\n\nAt the moment, Skechers has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), signifying that it may outperform the overall market trend in the upcoming period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nA Look at Skechers' Recent Stock Price Performance\n\nOver the preceding four weeks, the stock's value has diminished by 6.4%, against a downturn of 0.2% in the Zacks S&P 500 composite. In parallel, the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, which counts Skechers among its entities, has depreciated by 1.7%. Over the past three months, the company's shares have seen a decline of 3.6% versus the S&P 500's 7.5% increase. The sector overall has witnessed an increase of 1.4% over the same period.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 29, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are Expro Group Holdings XPRO, Skechers SKX, Acushnet GOLF, National Fuel Gas Co. NFG and International Paper IP.\n\n5 Stocks Based on High Efficiency to Enrich Your Portfolio\n\nEfficiency level measures a company\u2019s capability to transform available input into output and is often considered an important parameter for gauging its potential to make profits. A company with a high efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance.\n\nHowever, at times, it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:\n\nThese efficiency ratios are:\n\nReceivables Turnover: This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company\u2019s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \u201caccounts receivable turnover ratio\u201d or \u201cdebtor\u2019s turnover ratio\u201d is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.\n\nAsset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company\u2019s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.\n\nInventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company\u2019s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.\n\nOperating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company\u2019s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.\n\nScreening Criteria\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank \u2014 Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) \u2014 to the screen to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nInventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization, and Operating Margin greater than the industry average\n\n(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)\n\nThe use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to 14.\n\nHere are the top five stocks that made it through the screen:\n\nExpro Group Holdings is an oil and gas service company. XPRO has an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 78.4%.\n\nSkechers designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas. SKX has an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 34.1%.\n\nAcushnet designs, develops, manufactures, and distributes golf products. GOLF has an average four-quarter earnings surprise of nearly 20.5%.\n\nNational Fuel Gas Co. is an integrated energy company, which has natural gas assets located in the prolific Appalachian basin and oil-producing assets in California. NFG has an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.9%.\n\nInternational Paper is a global producer of renewable fiber-based products. IP has an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.12%.\n\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nTexas Capital Bancshares\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Citi downgraded Texas Capital Bancshares Inc (NASDAQ:TCBI) to Sell with a $60 price target.\n\n*TLDR: *2025 goals appear unachievable in a lower rate environment. *Citi remains cautious.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Citi maintains a cautious stance on TCBI, despite the soft share price reaction following the company\u2019s second-quarter results. The analysts continue to see downside from current levels, as the earnings outlook over the next 12 months appears rather uninspiring.\n\nWhile the core franchise has undergone significant changes since 2020, Citi believes that the 2025 Goal metrics are unachievable in a lower interest rate environment. Despite the already below peer Price-to-Tangible Book Value valuation, Citi continues to foresee further downside.\n\nSell at Citi means \u201cBuy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks; and Sell (3) for negative ETR. \u201c\n\nHow did the stock react? Texas Capital Banc shares opened the regular session at $64.69 and closed at $66.70, a gain of 1.06% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nSkechers\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley upgraded Skechers (NYSE:SKX) to Overweight with a $80 price target.\n\n*TLDR: *Set-up for positive consensus revisions. *Management improves Skecher financial metrics.* Morgan Stanley sees possible +26% share price appreciation inside 12-18 months.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Morgan Stanley\u2019s updated price target reflects a modestly improved operating model and updated DCF assumptions. For FY24, the bank\u2019s estimates remain largely unchanged, continuing to see upside to Street EPS forecasts across sales, GM, and SG&A. As a result, the bank analysts are modeling $4.20 EPS versus the consensus of $4.10.\n\nLooking at the future, the bank is now more constructive on SKX\u2019s mid-term margin profile, driven primarily by an improved GM outlook. Early signs indicate that GM is holding at structurally higher levels of 53%+. This view is taken because survey results and channel checks suggest that consumers continue to view SKX as a value-oriented brand, brand momentum remains strong despite price-taking activities over the last few years, and innovation capabilities are being increasingly recognized. These factors together increase Morgan Stanley\u2019s comfort with SKX\u2019s ability to maintain or expand GM from here.\n\nAs such, Morgan Stanley now models a 12% average operating margin for '24-'28e versus 11% prior, driven primarily by a more optimistic GM outlook. The mid-term sales growth expectations remain largely unchanged at ~10% average '24-'28e growth. Combined with updated WACC inputs (4.3% risk-free rate & 4.1% equity risk premium versus 4.1% & 4.6% prior, respectively) that result in a 9.4% WACC (versus 10% prior), this yields an $80 DCF-derived price target compared to $60 prior, representing a 26% upside from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverweight at Morgan Stanley means \u201cThe stock's total return is expected to exceed the total return of the relevant country MSCI Index or the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis over the next 12-18 months .\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Skechers opened the regular session at $66.24 and closed at $65.10, a gain of 1.39% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nLockheed Martin\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, TD Cowen upgraded Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) to Buy with a $560 price target.\n\n*TLDR: *Strong Q2 for Lockheed Martin (LMT): Driven by F-35 delivery restart and leading FMS/munitions market position, projecting ~5% sales gains, 10-20bps margin lift, and rising cash flow for 2024-2026. *Despite positives, stock lags with a 20% net buy rating\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? TD Cowen analysts highlight a strong Q2 performance for Lockheed Martin, driven by the restart of F-35 deliveries and its leading position in the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and munitions market. This has provided LMT with enhanced visibility of approximately 5% sales gains, a 10-20 basis points annual margin lift, and rising cash flow projections for 2024-2026. Despite these positive indicators, the stock has lagged year-to-date, with a peer-low 20% net buy rating.\n\nThe analysts note that with the resumption of F-35 deliveries, LMT has reached an agreement with the Department of Defense (DoD) on a schedule for completing TR3 updates and is negotiating the timing for final delivery payments of around $7 million per aircraft, totaling approximately $1 billion. Given that LMT has delivered only 1,300 of the planned 3,400+ F-35 fighters, it is unlikely that the DoD will cut production even if software issues remain unresolved. Additionally, LMT\u2019s ownership of the intellectual property gives it leverage in these negotiations. The analysts foresee low to mid-single-digit F-35 sales growth from 2025-2027 as sustainment grows with the fleet and delivery payments catch up. Furthermore, the F-16 program, with a backlog of 125 planes, is ramping up production from two to four planes per month by the second half of 2026. Both programs are expected to see increasing profitability, contributing to 28% of LMT\u2019s sales.\n\nBuy at TD Cowen means \u201cThe stock is expected to achieve a total return of +15% or more over the next 12 months.\u201c\n\nHow did the stock react? Lockheed Martin opened the regular session at $504.21 and closed at $515.20, a gain of 2.77% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nOmega Healthcare Investors\n\nWhat happened? On Mizuho, downgraded Omega Healthcare Investors Inc (NYSE:OHI) to Neutral with a $35 price target\n\n*TLDR: *Valuation is key driver of downgrade following outperformance against peers. *Mizuho sees nothing wrong with the OHI as a business.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Mizuho has downgraded Omega Healthcare Investors to Neutral from Outperform, stating that the current valuation largely reflects the three pillars of its previous top pick stance. The brokerage clarified that this downgrade is not a call into earnings.\n\nPreviously, Mizuho had highlighted several reasons for favoring skilled nursing facilities and particularly Omega: higher than anticipated cash collections from tenants in restructuring, an increase in external growth through acquisitions, and a more benign regulatory environment.\n\nWhile Mizuho continues to see a high single-digit cash flow trajectory into FY 2025, the stock has outperformed REITs by 18bps year-to-date and is trading close to 13x adjusted funds from operations, which is near historical highs. As a result, the brokerage believes the positives are largely reflected in the current valuation\n\nNeutral at Mizuho means \u201cThe stock\u2019s total return is expected to perform in line with the unweighted, expected total return of the analyst\u2019s industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Omega Healthcare Investors opened the regular session at $35.97 and closed at $35.73, a decline of 1.81% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nLockheed Martin\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Deutsche Bank upgraded Lockheed Martin to Buy with a $600 price target. This is the second upgrade of the week for the defense company.\n\n*TLDR:* Strong Q2 report showing gains on repricing of backlog should continue momentum through 2025 and 2026 as data surprises consensus.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? This upgrade is driven by strong second-quarter results, which, after further analysis, indicate a promising beat/raise opportunity in the second half of 2024. The bank believes this momentum could extend into 2025 and 2026, with potential upside to 2026 EBIT approaching the high single-digit range. If the outlook on revisions for LMT is positive relative to Deutsche Bank\u2019s and the Street\u2019s printed numbers, the stock could rerate to reflect this opportunity, supporting a 5.0% target free cash flow yield on 2026, driving the updated target price of $600, representing a 15% upside potential.\n\nFor the second half of 2024, Deutsche Bank anticipates improved operational performance and a significant spread between trailing three-year backlog growth (+17%) and trailing three-year revenue growth (+7%), suggesting additional revenue upside. Recently improved cost and EAC trends, along with the benefit of an increasingly repriced backlog, point to continued positive margin surprises. This could drive approximately 4% EBIT upside to second-half 2024 Street EBIT forecasts. Looking ahead to 2025 and 2026, Deutsche Bank expects revenue growth to approach 6%+ versus the Street\u2019s 3.9%/3.6%, with additional margin normalization across the business, making it feasible to achieve high single-digit EBIT upside to Street estimates for 2026. While Deutsche Bank has raised its estimates conservatively, it is modeling EBIT growth at a 7% CAGR over the next two years, viewing LMT as a high-quality way to participate in a global defense upcycle.\n\nBuy at Deutsche Bank means \u201cBased on a current 12-month view of TSR, we recommend that investors buy the stock.\u201d\n\nHow did the stock react? Lockheed Martin opened the regular session at $522.89 and closed at $524.80, a gain of 0.63% from the prior day\u2019s regular close.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet calls of the week: Upgrades for Skechers and Lockheed Martin\n\nWould the US outperform if Trump wins a clean sweep?\n\nMitsubishi Motors to join Honda-Nissan alliance, Nikkei reports\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX delivered second-quarter 2024 results, with the top and bottom lines lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales improved but earnings declined year over year. Challenges such as supply-chain disruptions, foreign currency headwinds, regulatory issues in India, and weakened consumer demand in China impacted the overall performance.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company continued to focus on product innovation, emphasizing comfort technologies and strategic partnerships. Comprehensive marketing efforts, including new channels for football and basketball products, supported brand growth. Skechers remains committed to its goal of reaching $10 billion in annual sales by 2026.\r\n\r\nOver the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have gained 24.7% against the industry\u2019s 30.3% decline.\n\nSkechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nSkechers U.S.A., Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Quote\n\nQ2 Highlights\n\nSkechers posted second-quarter earnings of 91 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 94 cents. Also, the bottom line declined 7.1% from the year-earlier quarter.\r\n\r\nSKX generated sales of $2,157.6 million, lagging the consensus estimate of $2,219 million. However, the top line grew 7.2% year over year, driven by a 6.9% rise in international sales and a 7.7% increase in domestic sales. Improvements in domestic and international sales were driven by robust DTC and Wholesale sales. On a constant-currency basis, total sales grew 8.7%.\r\nThe company\u2019s wholesale sales increased 5.5% year over year to $1.13 billion, while DTC rose 9.2% to $1.03 billion. Our estimate for wholesale and DTC sales was pegged at $1.15 billion and $1.05 billion, respectively.\r\n\r\nWholesale sales increased 10.3% year over year in the Americas (\u201cAMER\u201d), and 3.9% in Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EMEA), partially offset by a decrease of 2.6% in the Asia Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d). Wholesale average selling price declined 0.8%, whereas the unit volume increased 6.4% year over year.\r\n\r\nDTC sales growth included increases of 1.4% in domestic DTC sales and 15.2% in international DTC sales. The DTC unit volume rose 10.2% and the average selling price declined 1%. Also, growth of 4.1% in the AMER, 5.8% in the APAC and 40.6% in the EMEA aided the segment\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nRegion-wise, sales increased 7.2% year over year to $1.10 billion in the AMER, 13.7% to $492.5 million in the EMEA and 2.2% to $564.2 million in the APAC. We expected sales from the AMER, EMEA and APAC regions to increase 8.9%, 7.5% and 11.6%, respectively, for the quarter under review.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMargins & Costs\n\nGross profit increased 11.7% year over year to $1.18 billion. Also, the gross margin expanded 220 basis points (bps) to 54.9%, primarily driven by lower costs per unit due to a decline in freight costs and a favorable mix of DTC volumes. We estimated the metric to expand 70 bps to 53.4% for the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nTotal operating expenses grew 16% year over year to $977.9 million. The metric, as a percentage of sales, increased 340 bps to 45.3%. We expected total operating expenses to rise 15.5% for the quarter.\r\n\r\nSelling expenses grew 26.1% from the year-ago period to $235.9 million. Also, general and administrative expenses jumped 13.2% to $742 million. Increased costs resulted from higher brand demand creation expenditure, along with elevated labor and facility costs, such as rent and depreciation.\n\nOther Financial Aspects\n\nAs of Jun 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.28 billion, whereas short-term investments amounted to $130.1 million.\r\n\r\nSkechers ended the quarter with long-term borrowings of $45.7 million and shareholders\u2019 equity of $4.22 billion, excluding non-controlling interests of $292.3 million. The company incurred a capital expenditure of $169.5 million in the quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter of 2024, management repurchased 0.9 million shares of its Class A common stock for $60 million. The company\u2019s board authorized a new $1-billion share repurchase program.\n\nStore Update\n\nAs of Jun 30, 2024, SKX had 5,267 stores, including 576 domestic stores, 1,126 international locations, and 3,565 distributors, licensee and franchise stores.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter, the company opened 25 domestic stores, 98 international stores, and 194 distributors, licensee and franchise stores. It closed 12 domestic stores, 57 international stores, and 149 distributor, licensee and franchise stores in the same period.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, management targets sales between $8.88 billion and $8.98 billion compared with the previously mentioned $8.73 billion and $8.88 billion. It predicts earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) between $4.08 and $4.18 compared with the previously stated $3.95 and $4.10. Management anticipates a capital expenditure of $325-$375 million for 2024.\r\n\r\nFor the third quarter of 2024, SKX is likely to achieve sales between $2.30 billion and $2.35 billion and EPS between $1.10 and $1.15.\n\nOther Solid Picks\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the retail space are The Gap, Inc.

        "title": "Is It Too Late To Consider Buying Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX)?",
        "content": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a decent share price growth of 13% on the NYSE over the last few months. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s take a look at Skechers U.S.A\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Skechers U.S.A\n\nIs Skechers U.S.A Still Cheap?\n\nGreat news for investors \u2013 Skechers U.S.A is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $95.34, but it is currently trading at US$63.71 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Skechers U.S.A\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Skechers U.S.A generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Skechers U.S.A's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 60%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since SKX is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on SKX for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy SKX. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nDiving deeper into the forecasts for Skechers U.S.A mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

        "title": "5 Stocks Backed by High Efficiency to Enrich Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Efficiency level measures a company\u2019s capability to transform available input into output and is often considered an important parameter for gauging its potential to make profits. A company with a high efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance.\n\nHowever, at times, it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:\n\nThese efficiency ratios are:\n\nReceivables Turnover: This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company\u2019s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \u201caccounts receivable turnover ratio\u201d or \u201cdebtor\u2019s turnover ratio\u201d is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.\n\nAsset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company\u2019s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.\n\nInventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company\u2019s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.\n\nOperating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company\u2019s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.\n\nScreening Criteria\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank \u2014 Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) \u2014 to the screen to make this strategy more profitable. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nInventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization, and Operating Margin greater than the industry average\n\n(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to 14.\n\nHere are the top five stocks that made it through the screen:\n\nExpro Group Holdings XPRO is an oil and gas service company. XPRO has an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 78.4%.\n\nSkechers SKX designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas. SKX has an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 34.1%.\n\nAcushnet GOLF designs, develops, manufactures, and distributes golf products. GOLF has an average four-quarter earnings surprise of nearly 20.5%.\n\nNational Fuel Gas Company NFG is an integrated energy company, which has natural gas assets located in the prolific Appalachian basin and oil-producing assets in California. NFG has an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.9%.\n\nInternational Paper IP is a global producer of renewable fiber-based products.

        "content": "Thursday, July 25th, 2024\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s tough to get a firm handle on this market. One day it looks like a trading rotation into undervalued equities from big run-ups elsewhere, the next day it\u2019s a major selloff across the board. This day, we were back to the \u201crotation\u201d scenario: the Dow gained +81 points, +0.20%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 kept up its two-week dominance, +1.47%, while the S&P 500 sold off another -0.51% and the Nasdaq -0.93% following the single-worst trading day of 2024 (so far).\r\n\r\nDuring the massive gains on the A.I. trade a year-plus ago, the Nasdaq and S&P pulled way ahead. Small-cap stocks, including regional banks and such, were left out in the cold. Now, with the A.I. trade long in the tooth and the promise of an interest rate cut from the Fed (not likely next week; more like September\u2019s meeting), it\u2019s the small-caps catching a bid. Since July 10, the Russell is +9.8% while the Nasdaq is -8.3%. That\u2019s a fairly wide gap in just two weeks and a day.\r\n\r\nTwo major retailers reported this afternoon. Deckers DECK, the maker of Hoka footwear, UGG boots and more, posted a giant beat on its fiscal Q1 bottom line: earnings of $4.52 per share blew the doors off the $3.59 expected and the $2.41 per share from the same quarter last year, for an +87% earnings beat over estimates. Revenues of $825 million outpaced the $805.5 million estimated, a +22% year-over-year increase. The company only has one earnings miss in the past five years.\r\n\r\nThat said, earnings guidance, while higher, is still below consensus. A range of $29.75-30.65 per share remains below the $30.81 earlier estimate Zacks analysts had surmised. Shares are still +7.9% in late trading, as the overall quarterly results are solid. Hoka grew +29.7% from a year ago, UGG was +14%, Teva +4.3% and the company will be divesting from its smaller, underperforming Sanuk brand, which brought in less than $7 million in the quarter.\r\n\r\nSkechers SKX also reported Q2 earnings after the close. The less-expensive portfolio of footwear and accessories missed on both top and bottom lines: earnings of 91 cents per share on $2.16 billion in revenues were shy of the 94 cents per share and $2.22 in sales anticipated. This breaks the six-quarter earnings winning streak, though the company did announce a $1 billion share buyback. The company also raised guidance going forward. Shares are up +2.8% on the news.\r\n\r\nFriday morning, we\u2019ll see Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) for June. This will be the last major non-jobs-related economic print ahead of the week\u2019s Fed meeting, and the Fed\u2019s favorite set on inflation metrics. Year-over-year expectations are for headline PCE to tick down to +2.5% from +2.6% in the previous month, with core year-over-year PCE staying at +2.6%, steadily coming down over the longer term. PCE has basically been cut in half over the past two years or so.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll also see the latest batch of earnings reports. 3M MMM expects both earnings and sales to come in lower by double digits, Bristol Myers-Squibb BMY is expected to come in lower on earnings but higher on revenues, and Colgate-Palmolive CL expects double-digit earnings growth and single-digit sales growth. All three companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 with a Value-Growth-Momentum score of C.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "Skechers (SKX) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.91 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.94 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.98 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -3.19%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this shoe company would post earnings of $1.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.33, delivering a surprise of 20.91%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nSkechers , which belongs to the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, posted revenues of $2.16 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.75%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.01 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nSkechers shares have added about 2.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 13.8%.\n\nWhat's Next for Skechers?\n\nWhile Skechers has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Skechers: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.12 on $2.22 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.11 on $8.85 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Shoes and Retail Apparel is currently in the top 16% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Wolverine World Wide (WWW), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 7.\n\nThis footwear maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -47.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nWolverine World Wide's revenues are expected to be $436.6 million, down 25.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Skechers (NYSE:SKX) Misses Q2 Sales Targets",
        "content": "Skechers (NYSE:SKX) Misses Q2 Sales Targets\n\nFootwear company Skechers (NYSE:SKX) missed analysts' expectations in Q2 CY2024, with revenue up 7.2% year on year to $2.16 billion. On the other hand, next quarter's outlook exceeded expectations with revenue guided to $2.33 billion at the midpoint, or 4.5% above analysts' estimates. It made a GAAP profit of $0.91 per share, down from its profit of $0.98 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Skechers? Find out in our full research report.\n\nSkechers (SKX) Q2 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $2.16 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.24 billion (3.5% miss) EPS: $0.91 vs analyst expectations of $0.95 (3.9% miss) Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2024 is $2.33 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $2.22 billion The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year from $8.8 billion to $8.93 billion at the midpoint, a 1.4% increase Gross Margin (GAAP): 54.9%, up from 52.7% in the same quarter last year Locations: 5,267 at quarter end, up from 4,705 in the same quarter last year Constant Currency Revenue rose 11% year on year (8.2% in the same quarter last year) Market Capitalization: $9.76 billion\n\nSynonymous with \"dad shoe\", Skechers (NYSE:SKX) is a footwear company renowned for its comfortable, stylish, and affordable shoes for all ages.\n\nFootwear\n\nBefore the advent of the internet, styles changed, but consumers mainly bought shoes by visiting local brick-and-mortar shoe, department, and specialty stores. Today, not only do styles change more frequently as fads travel through social media and the internet but consumers are also shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some footwear companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind.\n\nSales Growth\n\nReviewing a company's long-term performance can reveal insights into its business quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one tends to sustain growth for years. Regrettably, Skechers's sales grew at a weak 11.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This shows it failed to expand in any major way and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Skechers Total Revenue\n\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or emerging trend. Skechers's recent history shows its demand slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 10.3% over the last two years is below its five-year trend.\n\nSkechers also reports sales performance excluding currency movements, which are outside the company\u2019s control and not indicative of demand. Over the last two years, its constant currency sales averaged 11.7% year-on-year growth. Because this number aligns with its normal revenue growth, we can see Skechers's foreign exchange rates have been steady.\n\nStory continues Skechers Year-On-Year Constant Currency Growth\n\nThis quarter, Skechers's revenue grew 7.2% year on year to $2.16 billion, missing Wall Street's estimates. The company is guiding for revenue to rise 14.8% year on year to $2.33 billion next quarter, improving from the 7.8% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 11.3% over the next 12 months, an acceleration from this quarter.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income\u2013the bottom line\u2013excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\n\nSkechers's operating margin has risen over the last year and averaged 9.3%. The company's higher efficiency is a breath of fresh air, but its suboptimal cost structure means it still sports mediocre profitability for a consumer discretionary business. Skechers Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nThis quarter, Skechers generated an operating profit margin of 9.6%, down 1.2 percentage points year on year. This reduction is quite minuscule and indicates the company's overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n\nKey Takeaways from Skechers's Q2 Results\n\nWe were disappointed to see Sketchers miss analysts' EPS and revenue expectations. On the other hand, we were glad to see full-year revenue expectations raised. Zooming out, we think this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing the company is staying on track. The stock traded up 1.9% to $64.90 immediately after reporting.\n\nSo should you invest in Skechers right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "LOS ANGELES, July 25, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (\"Skechers\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:SKX), The Comfort Technology CompanyTM and a global footwear leader, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nRecord second quarter sales of $2.16 billion, a 7.2% increase, and constant currency sales of $2.19 billion, an 8.7% increase Direct-to-Consumer sales grew 9.2% Wholesale sales grew 5.5% Diluted earnings per share of $0.91 New $1 billion share repurchase program\n\n\"Skechers achieved a new second quarter sales record of $2.16 billion driven by the strong demand for our diverse portfolio of comfortable and innovative footwear,\" said David Weinberg, Chief Operating Officer of Skechers. \"The growth resulted from sales increases of 9% in Direct-to-Consumer and 6% in Wholesale, as well as increases of 7% internationally and 8% domestically. We continued to achieve growth across all regions including 7% in the Americas; 14% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and 2% in Asia Pacific. International direct-to-consumer and domestic wholesale were particularly bright spots, increasing 15% and 14% respectively. These international increases are noteworthy given substantial headwinds from foreign currency, a lackluster 6-18 in China, and supply chain disruptions related to the Suez Canal crisis. That said, we are extremely encouraged by the demand for Skechers product as demonstrated in second half orders, which has led us to raise our full-year outlook for sales and earnings. As we look to the remainder of the year and beyond, we remain focused on enhancing our global infrastructure, managing inventory levels, and driving efficiencies to achieve profitable growth.\"\n\n\"This quarter marked the 25th anniversary of our initial public offering. As we celebrated this event, we also achieved record second quarter sales and further solidified our position as the third largest athletic footwear company in the world by continuing to deliver comfortable, and innovative footwear worldwide,\" began Robert Greenberg, Chief Executive Officer. \"I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the accomplishments of the entire Skechers organization and appreciative of our strong partnerships with our customers and growing roster of elite ambassadors, such as the recently signed Philadelphia 76ers basketball star Joel Embiid, as well as collaborations with distinguished brands such as John Deere. Team Skechers now includes numerous athletes competing on global stages, including Golden Boot winner, Euro Cup finalist and Captain of the England football team, Harry Kane; recently announced Skechers ambassador and 2022-2023 NBA most valuable player Joel Embiid, who is playing for the United States; British golfer Matt Fitzpatrick; Canadian golfer Brooke Henderson; Spanish race walker Diego Garcia and newly signed American beach volleyball players Andy Benesh and Miles Partain, who will be playing in Skechers branded uniforms. This diverse team of world class athletes and celebrities, including Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg, drive awareness and purchase intent for Skechers. Our first commercial featuring Harry Kane aired during the second quarter, and we recently completed several new campaigns featuring him alongside former UK footballer and Skechers ambassador Jamie Redknapp and superstar Snoop Dogg, who will be a broadcast commentator in Paris. Additionally, our football footwear launched globally this month, Skechers x John Deere is launching next month, and basketball footwear will be released globally in August. We are committed to strategically delivering comfort footwear and apparel for all walks of life, supporting our vast offering with targeted marketing, and building our in-store presence globally.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results Three Months Ended June 30, Change (in millions, except per share data) 2024 2023 $ % Sales $ 2,157.6 $ 2,012.5 145.1 7.2 Gross profit 1,184.4 1,060.5 123.9 11.7 Gross margin 54.9 % 52.7 % 220 bps Operating expenses 977.9 842.8 135.1 16.0 As a % of sales 45.3 % 41.9 % 340 bps Earnings from operations 206.5 217.7 (11.2 ) (5.1 ) Operating margin 9.6 % 10.8 % (120) bps Net earnings attributable to Skechers U.S.A., Inc. 140.3 152.8 (12.5 ) (8.2 ) Diluted earnings per share $ 0.91 $ 0.98 (0.07 ) (7.1 )\n\nSecond quarter sales increased 7.2% as a result of a 6.9% increase internationally and a 7.7% increase domestically.

The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of period-over-period fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and is consistent with how management evaluates the Company\u2019s performance.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 25, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Skechers SKX, Deckers Outdoors DECK and Nike NKE.\n\nConsumer Strength Fueling Record Results for These Retailers Reporting Thursday\n\nWe've got a stacked earnings schedule this week, with nearly every pocket of the economy being represented.\n\nAmong the bunch are two consumer-facing companies \u2013 Skechers and Deckers Outdoors. DECK shares have been notably strong in 2024, whereas SKX shares have lagged relative to the S&P 500.\n\nConsumer strength has led to robust quarterly results from the pair, with each exceeding Zacks Consensus EPS estimates throughout 2024. In addition, both sport favorable Zacks Ranks, reflecting upward trending estimate revisions among analysts.\n\nWith their results looming, let's take a closer look at results from another consumer-facing company, Nike, as a light guide.\n\nNike Forced to Recalibrate Product Portfolio\n\nNike shares have faced notable pressure following the release of its quarterly results in 2024. Down 30% YTD, the stock has plunged following back-to-back releases. Concerning the knee-jerk reaction in its latest print, the company updated its FY25 outlook following challenges faced throughout the quarter.\n\nAnalysts downwardly revised their earnings expectations accordingly following the lowered outlook, landing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nStill, it doesn't appear that consumer weakness has been driving the retail giant's soft results but rather a reflection of consumers' shifting preferences. CFO Matt Friend stated, 'Although our digital business has grown at an approximately 26% CAGR since Fiscal 19, we missed our Q4 plan on softer traffic, higher promotions, and lower sales of certain classic footwear franchises.'\n\nHe continued, 'Therefore, despite continued marketplace demand, we are advancing our timelines to tighten total supply of certain classic footwear franchises \u2013 at different paces, across different channels, around the world.'\n\nThe company remains focused on rebalancing its product portfolio accordingly, hoping to re-capture consumers through innovation. For example, Nike noticed an opportunity in retro-styled running and moved quickly to add it to its Y2K portfolio. So far, the results have been positive, with Nike now expecting to triple its retro-running business in FY25.\n\nOverall, consumer weakness hasn't driven the company's soft quarterly results, but rather shifting preferences.\n\nSkechers Posts Record Quarterly Sales\n\nEarnings expectations for Skechers have remained stable over recent months, with the $0.92 per share expected suggesting a 6% decline from the year-ago period. Revenue expectations have actually ticked 0.5% higher to $2.2 billion, reflecting a 10% increase year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company posted record quarterly sales in its latest release, with direct-to-consumer sales also climbing an impressive 17%.\n\nThe CFO's comments confirmed the brand momentum: 'Skechers continues to reach new milestones in expanding our global footprint. Achieving another sales record and exceptional earnings is a testament to the strength of our brand and our ability to meet consumers' needs.'\n\nDeckers Outdoor Enjoys Robust Growth\n\nThe outlook for DECK's upcoming release has shifted notably bright, with the $3.52 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 22% over the last several months and suggesting a 46% climb year-over-year. Like SKX, brand momentum has led to robust results for the company, including record sales for FY24.\n\nCEO Dave Powers, on the results, 'HOKA and UGG remain two of the most admired and well-positioned brands in the marketplace, each with a robust innovation product pipeline designed to win with global consumers. Looking forward, our talented teams are highly motivated to continue driving towards the long-term opportunities of these iconic brands.'\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nWhile Nike's quarterly results brought some scrutiny on the current state of the consumer, the soft results appear to be more of a reflection of shifting consumer preferences, with the company now recalibrating its product portfolio.\n\nHowever, both Skechers and Deckers Outdoor have seen positive tailwinds from a resilient consumer, with their brands appealing nicely. In addition, both have enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions, providing fuel for shares to move higher.\n\nBoth DECK and SKX report on Thursday, July 25, after the market's close.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "2 Footwear Stocks to Consider as Earnings Approach",
        "content": "Quarterly results from prominent retailers will continue to highlight this week\u2019s earnings lineup. Furthermore, Deckers Outdoor DECK and Skechers SKX are two top-rated retail apparel stocks that look attractive ahead of their quarterly reports after-market hours on Thursday, July 25.\n\nWith both having a special niche in regard to footwear, let\u2019s see why now is a good time to buy Deckers and Skechers stock.\n\nDeckers Q1 Expectations\n\nSpecializing in footwear and accessories for outdoor sports among other lifestyle-related activities, Deckers will be reporting results for its fiscal first quarter with Q1 sales expected to spike 19% to $804.49 million.\n\nDeckers' massive profitability should remain a highlight as well with Q1 EPS projected to soar 46% to $3.53 compared to $2.41 per share a year ago. Deckers' popular UGG boots have been a spark to its expansion along with its HOKA brand, which it plans to build into a multi-billion-dollar global player in the performance athletics space.\n\nNotably, Deckers has exceeded bottom line expectations for 10 consecutive quarters posting a very impressive average earnings surprise of 42.82% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSkechers Q2 Expectations\n\nRevamping itself as a leader in comfortable casual footwear, Skechers Q2 sales are expected at $2.21 billion which would be a 10% increase from the comparative quarter. This is despite Q2 EPS thought to have dipped -5% to $0.93.\n\nHowever, the Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) does indicate Skechers could surpass earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS pegged at $0.97 and 3% above the Zacks Consensus. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlus, Skechers has beaten bottom line expectations for six straight quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 34.07% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAttractive Growth Trajectories\n\nOverall, Deckers' total sales are projected to increase 11% in its current fiscal 2025 with its top line forecasted to expand another 10% in FY26 to $5.22 billion. More impressive, annual earnings are expected to increase 5% in FY25 and are slated to rise another 12% in FY26 to a whopping $34.44 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTurning to Skechers, its top line is expected to expand 10% this year and is projected to increase another 9% in FY25 to $9.7 billion. Even better, Skechers is forecasted to post 18% EPS growth in FY24 with earnings slated to jump 14% in FY25 to $4.68 per share.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent Price Performance\n\nYear to date, Skechers stock is up a modest +2% while Deckers shares have climbed over +20%. Better still, Skechers stock is now sitting on +22% gains over the last year which has roughly matched the S&P 500 while Deckers' +52% has noticeably outperformed the broader market. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAhead of their Q2 reports, Skechers stock boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with Deckers sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It would be no surprise if these top-rated stocks kept rising if they could reach or exceed their quarterly expectations and offer positive guidance that reconfirms their attractive growth trajectories.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Second quarter earnings season picks up steam this week with several hundred companies expected to report earnings including many S&P 500 companies. Among them are two Mag 7 stocks in Alphabet and Tesla and plenty of other popular stocks.\n\nBut there will also be reports from a dozen important consumer-focused companies. Some are in travel, some in retail, and others make big-ticket leisure items like RVs and pools.\n\nWith the consumer making up over 70% of the US economy, these companies should provide some insight into what is going on.\n\nAdditionally, all 5 are trying to beat on earnings and managing expectations.\n\nIs the consumer still spending in the summer of 2024?\n\n5 Popular Consumer Stocks Reporting This Week\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tractor Supply Co.

        "title": "Consumer Strength Fuels Record Results for These 2 Companies",
        "content": "We\u2019ve got a stacked earnings schedule this week, with nearly every pocket of the economy being represented.\n\nAmong the bunch are two consumer-facing companies \u2013 Skechers SKX and Deckers Outdoors DECK. DECK shares have been notably strong in 2024, whereas SKX shares have lagged relative to the S&P 500.\n\nConsumer strength has led to robust quarterly results from the pair, with each exceeding Zacks Consensus EPS estimates throughout 2024. In addition, both sport favorable Zacks Ranks, reflecting upward trending estimate revisions among analysts.\n\nWith their results looming, let\u2019s take a closer look at results from another consumer-facing company, Nike NKE, as a light guide.\n\nNike Forced to Recalibrate Product Portfolio\n\nNike shares have faced notable pressure following the release of its quarterly results in 2024. Down 30% YTD, the stock has plunged following back-to-back releases. Concerning the knee-jerk reaction in its latest print, the company updated its FY25 outlook following challenges faced throughout the quarter.\n\nAnalysts downwardly revised their earnings expectations accordingly following the lowered outlook, landing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStill, it doesn\u2019t appear that consumer weakness has been driving the retail giant's soft results but rather a reflection of consumers\u2019 shifting preferences. CFO Matt Friend stated, \u2018Although our digital business has grown at an approximately 26% CAGR since Fiscal 19, we missed our Q4 plan on softer traffic, higher promotions, and lower sales of certain classic footwear franchises.\u2019\n\nHe continued, \u2018Therefore, despite continued marketplace demand, we are advancing our timelines to tighten total supply of certain classic footwear franchises \u2013 at different paces, across different channels, around the world.\u2019\n\nThe company remains focused on rebalancing its product portfolio accordingly, hoping to re-capture consumers through innovation. For example, Nike noticed an opportunity in retro-styled running and moved quickly to add it to its Y2K portfolio. So far, the results have been positive, with Nike now expecting to triple its retro-running business in FY25.\n\nOverall, consumer weakness hasn\u2019t driven the company\u2019s soft quarterly results, but rather shifting preferences. Below is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSkechers Posts Record Quarterly Sales\n\nEarnings expectations for Skechers have remained stable over recent months, with the $0.92 per share expected suggesting a 6% decline from the year-ago period. Revenue expectations have actually ticked 0.5% higher to $2.2 billion, reflecting a 10% increase year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company posted record quarterly sales in its latest release, with direct-to-consumer sales also climbing an impressive 17%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe CFO\u2019s comments confirmed the brand momentum: 'Skechers continues to reach new milestones in expanding our global footprint. Achieving another sales record and exceptional earnings is a testament to the strength of our brand and our ability to meet consumers\u2019 needs.\u2019\n\nDeckers Outdoor Enjoys Robust Growth\n\nThe outlook for DECK\u2019s upcoming release has shifted notably bright, with the $3.52 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 22% over the last several months and suggesting a 46% climb year-over-year. Like SKX, brand momentum has led to robust results for the company, including record sales for FY24. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCEO Dave Powers, on the results, \u2018HOKA and UGG remain two of the most admired and well-positioned brands in the marketplace, each with a robust innovation product pipeline designed to win with global consumers. Looking forward, our talented teams are highly motivated to continue driving towards the long-term opportunities of these iconic brands.\u2019 Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nWhile Nike\u2019s NKE quarterly results brought some scrutiny on the current state of the consumer, the soft results appear to be more of a reflection of shifting consumer preferences, with the company now recalibrating its product portfolio.\n\nHowever, both Skechers SKX and Deckers Outdoor DECK have seen positive tailwinds from a resilient consumer, with their brands appealing nicely. In addition, both have enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions, providing fuel for shares to move higher.\n\nBoth DECK and SKX report on Thursday, July 25, after the market\u2019s close.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The Consumer Discretionary group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Is Crocs (CROX) one of those stocks right now? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.\n\nCrocs is one of 281 companies in the Consumer Discretionary group. The Consumer Discretionary group currently sits at #11 within the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. Crocs is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nWithin the past quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CROX's full-year earnings has moved 2.1% higher. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.\n\nOur latest available data shows that CROX has returned about 40.6% since the start of the calendar year. In comparison, Consumer Discretionary companies have returned an average of -1.6%. As we can see, Crocs is performing better than its sector in the calendar year.\n\nOne other Consumer Discretionary stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year is Skechers (SKX). The stock is up 4.4% year-to-date.\n\nFor Skechers, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 7.7% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nBreaking things down more, Crocs is a member of the Textile - Apparel industry, which includes 20 individual companies and currently sits at #162 in the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has lost an average of 25.1% so far this year, so CROX is performing better in this area.\n\nOn the other hand, Skechers belongs to the Shoes and Retail Apparel industry. This 12-stock industry is currently ranked #35. The industry has moved -26.8% year to date.\n\nCrocs and Skechers could continue their solid performance, so investors interested in Consumer Discretionary stocks should continue to pay close attention to these stocks.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "As competitors falter, SoCal's Skechers is surging with strategy of 'try and try again'",
        "content": "Apparel and shoes are displayed at the Skechers store in Manhattan Beach. (Christina House / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn a crowded sneaker market roiled by the stumbles of its longtime king, Manhattan Beach-based Skechers has been climbing its way up the ranks.\n\nWhile Nike, which has dominated the athletic footwear landscape for years, made headlines last month for its plummeting stock price and gloomy outlook, Skechers announced record sales in the first quarter of 2024 of $2.25 billion, a 12.5% increase over last year. Since 2019, it has increased its annual revenue by more than 50%.\n\nIn June, Bank of America upgraded its rating on Skechers' stock to a strong buy, and this week Morgan Stanley followed suit \u2014 notable votes of confidence in the fundamentals of a company that has seen its stock price rise more than 20% over the last year. Shares closed at $65.10 on Tuesday.\n\nAnalysts and company leadership attribute the brand\u2019s success to a strategy built around constant innovation and a diverse array of footwear products. Sam Poser, a footwear and apparel analyst at Williams Trading, said Skechers is navigating choppy waters better than its rivals.\n\n\u201cIt's not like the macro environment is different for Skechers than it is for Nike or New Balance or Adidas,\u201d Poser said. \u201cOne of the reasons they\u2019re outperforming is because they\u2019re executing in this difficult environment.\u201d\n\nWhile Skechers offers a wide variety of of footwear \u2014 from soccer cleats to work boots to summer sandals \u2014 it has still managed to find a strong company identity, Poser said. Skechers and Snoop Dogg collaborated on shoes. Skechers offers a wide variety of footwear \u2014 soccer cleats, work boots, summer sandals and more. Children's shoes on display at the Skechers store in Manhattan Beach. Christina House / Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cSkechers owns the comfort business,\u201d Poser said. \u201cWhat they're doing is bigger than I think a lot of people appreciate.\u201d\n\nSkechers brought in $8 billion in sales in 2023 compared with $7.4 billion in 2022. The company has a near-term goal of reaching $10 billion in sales by 2026, said Chief Financial Officer John Vandemore.\n\nThe self-proclaimed \u201ccomfort technology company\u201d has seen success with recent releases such as Hands Free Slip-ins and podiatrist-certified Arch Fit shoes. Its website lists 14 different footwear technologies, with names like Glide-Step and Hyper Burst.\n\n\u201cYou have to be innovative and you have to deliver newness,\u201d Vandemore said in an interview. \u201cThere was no analogy in the marketplace when we started Slip-ins, and it\u2019s done exceedingly well.\u201d\n\nThe company is scheduled to announce its second-quarter results on Thursday, with analysts estimating revenue of $2.21 billion, up 10% from the same period a year ago, and earnings of 92 cents a share, down 6.1% from a year earlier, according to Zacks Equity Research.\n\nNot all of Skechers\u2019 gambles have paid off, Vandemore admitted. Introduced in 2009, Shape-up sneakers were immensely popular until the company was sued by the Federal Trade Commission over its claims that the shoes would help customers lose weight and tone their muscles. Skechers paid $40 million to settle the class-action lawsuit in 2013.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Skechers models have seen longer-term success, such as the children\u2019s line of light-up Twinkle Toes sneakers, introduced in 2008 and still widely available. Caleigh Hopson, 7, browses shoes with her mother, Laura, at the Skechers store in Manhattan Beach. (Christina House / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cI think that willingness to try and try again until you succeed is noteworthy and it's led to a significant amount of success,\u201d Vandemore said. He praised the company\u2019s chief executive, Robert Greenberg, for his willingness to take risks.\n\n\u201cOne of Robert's key talents is being able to tolerate risks and, quite frankly, not dwell upon them,\u201d Vandemore said. \u201cIn our culture we try a lot of different things. Some of them work and some of them don't.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Poser said, Nike has not been able to come up with fresh offerings for consumers in recent years.\n\n\u201cNike was not innovating enough and putting a lot of non-compelling product into the marketplace,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:Nike stocks see their biggest drop since 2001 amid weak fiscal outlook\n\nWhen Nike released its tepid first-quarter earnings report in March, its chief financial officer, Matthew Friend, said the company was \"taking action to build a faster, more efficient Nike and maximize the impact of our new innovation cycle.\u201d\n\nAlong with a pipeline of new products, Vandemore said, value and affordability are among the brand\u2019s top priorities. Several models featuring the popular Slip-in technology are available for less than $100.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re delivering a quality product that has comfort and style at a reasonable price,\u201d said Jim Duffy, a sports and lifestyle analyst at Stifel. \u201cIn an environment where the consumer is facing pressures to their discretionary spending capacity, Skechers is doing a very good job of offering value.\u201d\n\nIn a trend brought on by COVID-19, Duffy said, more consumers of all income levels are buying and wearing athletic footwear. A nice dinner out may have required dress shoes before the global pandemic, he said, but standards have changed.\n\n\u201cCOVID was an accelerator for casualization and that's really expanded the wearable occasions for sneakers and comfort footwear,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cSkechers has done well to capitalize on that.\u201d\n\nSkechers\u2019 customer base is mostly children and older adults, Duffy said, not teens and young adults. But Poser said the customer demographic varies largely across markets, both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much broader than you think,\u201d Poser said. \u201cThey have k-pop bands wearing their shoes.\u201d\n\nLast year, international sales accounted for 62% of the company\u2019s global revenue. Vandemore said Skechers\u2019 investment in growing its international footprint has provided the company an important boost in growth. Store manager Diane Morales unboxes a pair of shoes for a customer at the Skechers store in Manhattan Beach. (Christina House / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAt the end of March, the company had slightly more than 1,100 international stores, 565 domestic locations and more than 3,500 \"distributor, licensee and franchise stores,\" according to company figures. The corporate offices in Manhattan Beach house 1,280 employees.\n\nVandemore also said the company\u2019s balance of wholesale and direct-to-consumer sales set it apart from other brands in the industry.\n\n\u201cSome of our competitors have chosen to primarily focus on their own stores or their own online sales at the expense of wholesale partners, which is not our strategy,\u201d Vandemore said. \u201cWe embrace all avenues.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, 44% of Skechers\u2019 annual profits came from direct-to-consumer sales and 56% came from wholesale business.\n\nLooking to the future, Vandemore said Skechers will stick to its core strategy while adapting to new trends and demands.\n\n\u201cWe've been very successful focusing on developing and delivering great products, growing our direct-to-consumer channel and growing internationally,\u201d he said. \u201cThat formula, we do believe, will continue to yield results.\u201d\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "Skechers Earnings: What To Look For From SKX\n\nFootwear company Skechers (NYSE:SKX) will be reporting earnings tomorrow after the bell. Here's what to look for.\n\nSkechers beat analysts' revenue expectations by 2.3% last quarter, reporting revenues of $2.25 billion, up 12.5% year on year. It was a decent quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' constant currency revenue estimates.\n\nIs Skechers a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Skechers's revenue to grow 11% year on year to $2.23 billion, improving from the 7.7% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.94 per share. Skechers Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Skechers has missed Wall Street's revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Skechers's peers in the consumer discretionary segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Nike's revenues decreased 1.7% year on year, missing analysts' expectations by 1.9%, and Carnival reported revenues up 17.7%, topping estimates by 1.9%. Nike traded down 20% following the results while Carnival was up 12%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Nike's results here and Carnival's results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the consumer discretionary segment, with share prices up 9.8% on average over the last month. Skechers is down 8.7% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $80.4 (compared to the current share price of $66.45).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments()",

        "title": "Skechers (SKX) to Post Q2 Earnings: What Awaits the Stock?",
        "content": "As Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX gears up to unveil its second-quarter 2024 earnings results on Jul 25 after market close, investors are eager to gauge the company's performance. Known for its innovative footwear and strong brand presence, Skechers has been navigating through changing market dynamics and evolving consumer preferences.\r\n\r\nThe company is expected to register an increase in the top line, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues standing at $2,215 million, which indicates a notable 10% improvement from the prior-year figure.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share has been stable at 92 cents over the past 30 days, which suggests a decline of 6.1% from the year-ago period.\r\n\r\nSkechers has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 34.1%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company\u2019s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 20.9%.\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nSkechers' strategic focus on expanding its presence in key international markets is likely to have driven revenue growth in the second quarter. With new store openings and strengthened distribution networks in regions like China, India and Europe, the company is well-positioned to capture increased consumer demand. Enhanced logistics capabilities, such as the new distribution center in Panama, ensure efficient product flow and availability, further supporting global sales growth. We expect international wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenues to increase 6.6% and 17.8%, respectively.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSkechers' commitment to innovation continues to resonate with consumers. The introduction of new product lines, including partnerships with high-profile athletes and celebrities, enhances the brand's appeal across diverse demographics. The launch of performance and lifestyle footwear catering to sports like football, basketball and pickleball, along with stylish and comfortable everyday wear, attracts a broader customer base and drives repeat purchases.\r\n\r\nSkechers' comprehensive marketing strategy, which includes high-visibility campaigns and endorsements, plays a crucial role in boosting brand recognition and consumer engagement. By efficiently managing stock and aligning supply with market trends, the company can capitalize on sales opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe robust growth of Skechers' direct-to-consumer segment is a key revenue driver. Investments in e-commerce platforms and the opening of new company-owned stores enhance the shopping experience, making it easier for consumers to access Skechers products. The direct-to-consumer model not only boosts sales but also provides valuable insights into consumer preferences, allowing Skechers to tailor its offerings and marketing efforts effectively. We anticipate direct-to-consumer revenues to increase 12% in the quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, Skechers' earnings in the second quarter could have faced downward pressure. The company is increasing its marketing and demand creation spending, which, while beneficial for long-term growth, represents significant upfront costs. Seasonal variations and changes in consumer spending patterns may impact sales volume and operational efficiency. Competitive pressures from other brands, along with macroeconomic factors like inflation and fluctuating exchange rates, could also affect profitability. \r\n\r\nWe expect total operating expenses to increase by 15.5% in the to-be-reported quarter. As a result, the operating margin is expected to shrink by 170 basis points.\n\nStory continues\n\nSkechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Skechers U.S.A., Inc.

Quote\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nAs investors prepare for Skechers\u2019 second-quarter earnings, the question looms regarding earnings beat or miss. Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Skechers this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for Gap\u2019s fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at 41 cents per share, which calls for 20.6% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.

        "content": "Under Armour downgraded, Snap upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Snap (SNAP) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $16, up from $12. The firm's latest advertiser/agency conversations speak to improvements in Snap's ad business, including 7.0 attribution tools and an increase in advertiser willingness to test direct response offerings more broadly, the firm tells investors. Citi upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $345, up from $260. Coinbase shares are up 52% year-to-date, the opportunity from a more conducive regulatory environment is \"too large to ignore,\" contends Citi. HSBC upgraded Krispy Kreme(DNUT) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $14. The company announced the sale of its majority stake in Insomnia Cookies and is moving towards a leaner structure, the firm tells investors in a research note. Morgan Stanley upgraded Skechers (SKX) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $80, up from $60, as part of a broader research note on Branded Apparel and Footwear. The company \"scored impressively high\" on the firm's global brand momentum and perception survey scorecards, while the recent North America / E.U. sports- wear channel checks for Skechers was also \"upbeat,\" leaving the firm \"incrementally positive on the brand.\" Wells Fargo upgraded Equinix (EQIX) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $875, up from $825. Data center demand was solid in Q2, albeit not at records, although demand should re-accelerate again in the second half of 2024, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nHSBC downgraded Crowdstrike (CRWD) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $302, down from $388. The firm says near-term risks have arisen following the global IT outage. Morgan Stanley downgraded Under Armour(UAA) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $4, down from $8, as part of a broader research note on Branded Apparel and Footwear. The company's customers' next-12-months propensity to spend screened in-line with its major sportswear peers, but its brand momentum ranking was \"notably worse\" in popularity, loyalty, and change in past 12 months spending, resulted in an aggregate ranking that was below its competitors, the firm tells investors in a research note. Bernstein downgraded American Airlines (AAL) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $12, down from $18. Commercial missteps are expected to limit American's participation in the second half of 2024 pricing up cycle, the firm tells investors in a research note. Daiwa downgraded Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $150, down from $160. The firm is concerned about intensifying competition in medical sales, and expects lower medical device prices and higher tax rates. TD Cowen downgraded Darden Restaurants(DRI) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $150, down from $170. The firm expects the shares to \"stagnate,\" saying a lack of tangible sales drivers in a tough full-service industry backdrop presents greater risks than tailwinds to Darden's fiscal 2025 guidance for 1%-2% portfolio same store sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nArgus initiated coverage of DoorDash (DASH) with a Hold rating with no price target. TArgus notes DoorDash shares are trading at a premium on a price to sales basis compared to its peer group and in line with the peer group on enterprise value to sales, and its management will need time to navigate near-term challenges amid new legislation and new product verticals. Raymond James initiated coverage of Zscaler (ZS) with a Market Perform rating and no price target. The firm acknowledges Zscaler's leading position in a \"very attractive\" end market but says the company's \"elite financial profile\" is rightly reflected in its current valuation multiple. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of LandBridge (LB) with a Buy rating and $35 price target. The firm is constructive on the outlook for the company, saying its New Mexico-Texas Stateline acreage is well positioned to capture continued Permian Basin growth, notably for produced water disposal. Wells Fargo and Raymond James also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings. Meanwhile, Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Citi initiated the stock with Neutral-equivalent ratings. Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of Alumis (ALMS) with an Overweight rating and $36 price target. The firm says that while key de-risking catalysts for ESK-001 are in 2026, the stock's current valuation offers an attractive entry point relative to peers. Leerink, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Guggenheimer also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Indivior (INDV) with an Overweight rating and $22 price target. The firm says that despite a \"messy\" near-term following the guide-down, the company's visibility into sizable longer-term top-line and EBITDA growth is high.",

Revenues are expected to be $2.21 billion, up 10% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, there has been no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter.

        "content": "G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII is poised for sustained growth and profitability, with a strategic emphasis on omnichannel capabilities, market expansion, robust brand development and effective financial management laying a solid foundation for success. The company's diverse strategies and strong execution are projected to drive significant sales growth and bolster its global market presence.\r\n\r\nG-III Apparel is enhancing its e-commerce platforms, especially for its DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris brands. This includes modernizing site aesthetics, expanding CRM capabilities and improving technical operations. Partnerships with major online retailers, such as Amazon and Fanatics, support this digital push.\r\n\r\nThrough a strategic partnership with AWWG, G-III Apparel is expanding its European presence, leveraging AWWG's infrastructure in Spain and Portugal. Additionally, AWWG's strong position in the India market offers growth opportunities for G-III\u2019s brands.\r\n\r\nGIII is transforming its retail business in North America by making significant marketing investments to boost global brand awareness and sales. This includes reducing reliance on PVH brands and increasing market penetration in fast-growing regions like India and China. G-III Apparel plans to add more than 2,500 points of sale at retail partners across better department stores this fall, which is expected to drive significant sales growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBrand Development & Marketing Bode Well\n\nBrand development and marketing efforts have been robust for G-III Apparel. DKNY saw strong double-digit sales growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships, including one with the New York Yankees. International pop-up events have bolstered European expansion.\r\n\r\nKarl Lagerfeld experienced nearly 50% growth in North America, expanding distribution to 500 locations and introducing the sustainable Karl Lagerfeld Jeans line, with plans to leverage the upcoming Olympics for brand promotion.\r\n\r\nThe relaunch of Donna Karan was a standout success, marked by high average unit retails, better sell-through rates and significant retailer margins. Marketing campaigns featuring Cindy Crawford and Karlie Kloss have driven consumer engagement.\r\n\r\nDriven by these factors, G-III Apparel reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 net sales guidance at $3.2 billion, indicating 3% year-over-year growth. This positive outlook is supported by robust brand performance, strategic marketing investments and effective cost management.\n\nStory continues\n\nEstimate Trend\n\nThe positive sentiment surrounding G-III Apparel is reflected in the upward revisions of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share. Over the past 30 days, analysts have increased their estimates, resulting in an upward revision of 8 cents in the consensus estimate of $3.63 per share. The consensus estimate for the next fiscal year has also advanced 11 cents to $3.73 per share.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 19, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are Vital Farms VITL, Donaldson DCI, Atmos Energy ATO, First Solar FSLR and Skechers SKX.\n\n5 Low-Level Stocks to Buy Amid U.S.-China Trade Tension\n\nMajor stock indices in the United States ended lower on Jul 17, 2024, pulled down by microchip stocks\u2019 decline. Notably, microchip stocks sank following news reports that the Biden administration might impose severe trade restrictions against China in a bid to contain the availability of semiconductor technology to the latter.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, stock market players might not feel confident in making investments as trade tensions between these two economic giants sometimes result in global market imbalance. However, a prudent investor knows that one can buy stocks that are safe bets in periods of market decline. To this end, we recommend stocks like Vital Farms,Donaldson, Atmos Energy , First Solar and Skechers that have low leverage. Choosing them can shield investors from incurring huge losses in times of crisis.\n\nNow, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let\u2019s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.\n\nIn finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.\n\nHowever, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to excessive debt financing.\n\nThe crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.\n\nThe equity market can be volatile at times, and, as an investor, if you don\u2019t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks that bear low leverage and are, hence, less risky.\n\nTo identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears. The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.\n\nAnalyzing Debt/Equity\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the start of the second-quarter earnings season, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nConsidering the factors above, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.\n\nYet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.\n\nExcluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 23 stocks that made it through the screen.\n\nVital Farms: The company offers a range of produced pasture-raised foods, which include shell eggs, butter, hard-boiled eggs, ghee and liquid whole eggs.

        "content": "Since his disastrous debate performance in June, the calls have only grown louder for U.S. President Joe Biden, age 81 and the oldest man to run the White House, to step aside. Top Democratic leaders this week joined the rank-and-file members in calling for Biden to drop out of the race ahead of November\u2019s election. Biden has so far insisted he is not too old to do the job\u2014raising the question of how he compares in age to those leading the largest companies in the U.S.\n\nFortune has compiled a list of the seven oldest CEOs in the Fortune 500. While the average age for all Fortune 500 CEOs is 57, the age of chief executives on this list ranges from their late 70s to early 90s.

During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Skechers falls in, has lost 20.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Skechers is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share, indicating a change of -6.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 points to a change of +16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.64 indicates a change of +13.7% from what Skechers is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Skechers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for SKX _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Skechers, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8.85 billion and $9.7 billion estimates indicate +10.6% and +9.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSkechers reported revenues of $2.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.33 for the same period compares with $1.02 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.98%. The EPS surprise was +20.91%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSkechers is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Skechers. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Low-Leverage Stocks to Buy Amid U.S.-China Trade Tension",
        "content": "Major stock indices in the United States ended lower on Jul 17, 2024, pulled down by microchip stocks\u2019 decline. Notably, microchip stocks sank following news reports that the Biden administration might impose severe trade restrictions against China in a bid to contain the availability of semiconductor technology to the latter.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, stock market players might not feel confident in making investments as trade tensions between these two economic giants sometimes result in global market imbalance. However, a prudent investor knows that one can buy stocks that are safe bets in periods of market decline. To this end, we recommend stocks like Vital Farms VITL, Donaldson DCI, Atmos Energy ATO, First Solar FSLR and Skechers SKX that have low leverage. Choosing them can shield investors from incurring huge losses in times of crisis.\n\nNow, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let\u2019s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.\n\nIn finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.\n\nHowever, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to excessive debt financing.\n\nThe crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.\n\nThe equity market can be volatile at times, and, as an investor, if you don\u2019t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks that bear low leverage and are, hence, less risky.\n\nTo identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears. The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.\n\nAnalyzing Debt/Equity\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.\n\nWith the start of the second-quarter earnings season, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nConsidering the factors above, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.\n\nYet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.\n\nHere are the other parameters:\n\nDebt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.\r\n\r\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nPercentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock\u2019s price appreciation.\r\n\r\nVGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nEstimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.\n\nExcluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 23 stocks that made it through the screen.\n\nVital Farms: The company offers a range of produced pasture-raised foods, which include shell eggs, butter, hard-boiled eggs, ghee and liquid whole eggs. On Jun 26, 2024, Vital Farms revealed plans to expand its resilient supply chain with a second world-class egg washing and packing facility located in Seymour, IN. The new 72-acre facility will enable Vital Farms to continue growing its pasture-raised egg business and is expected to help generate more than $350 million in additional revenues.\n\nVITL delivered an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 102.10%. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VITL\u2019s 2024 sales suggests a solid 22.6% improvement from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nDonaldson: It is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of filtration systems and replacement parts across the world.

On Jun 4, 2024, First Solar revealed that its Series 6 Plus and Series 7 TR1 products are the world\u2019s first PV solar modules to achieve the EPEAT Climate+ designation. This makes FSLR\u2019s modules the first to meet the global standard of ultra-low carbon threshold of less-than-equal-to 400 kg CO2e/kWp.\n\nFSLR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - LL Bean has been sued by footwear maker Skechers USA, which accused the clothing and outdoor gear company of illegally copying its shoes, which have sold in the millions.\n\nAccording to a complaint filed late Monday in Manhattan federal court, the world's third-largest footwear company believes LL Bean's Freeport casual shoes infringe two patented designs for \"heel cups\" that surround the back of the foot.\n\nSkechers called its designs \"unique and eye-catching\" because they use \"graceful, sweeping, gently rolling lines and slopes\" resembling the shape of a heel.\n\n\"Only after Skechers incurred the substantial risk and monumental expense of developing and promoting its shoes with these heel cup designs, and established that they had broad appeal, did LL Bean enter the market with its infringing shoe,\" Skechers said.\n\nLL Bean did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. Skechers' lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including triple damages for any willful infringement, and to stop sales of infringing shoes.\n\nSkechers sued at a time many Americans concerned about inflation keep a lid on discretionary spending.\n\nThe Freeport shoes, sharing the name of LL Bean's Maine hometown, retail for $99 on LL Bean's website.\n\nLL Bean is privately held, and was founded in 1912. Skechers was founded 80 years later and is based in Manhattan Beach, California.\n\nThe case is Skechers USA Inc et al v LL Bean Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 24-05336.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, Editing by Franklin Paul)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Skechers (SKX) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Skechers (SKX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nSkechers currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.25, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.25 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 8.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SKX Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for SKX\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Skechers here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Skechers, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs SKX a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Skechers, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $4.08.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Skechers. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Skechers may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's Why Skechers U.S.A (NYSE:SKX) Has Caught The Eye Of Investors",
        "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Skechers U.S.A (NYSE:SKX). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Skechers U.S.A\n\nHow Quickly Is Skechers U.S.A Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Skechers U.S.A's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 59%. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Skechers U.S.A shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 7.8% to 10%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Skechers U.S.A's future EPS 100% free.\n\nAre Skechers U.S.A Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$10b company like Skechers U.S.A. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$412m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nShould You Add Skechers U.S.A To Your Watchlist?\n\nSkechers U.S.A's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So at the surface level, Skechers U.S.A is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this freediscounted cashflow valuation of Skechers U.S.A.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Skechers U.S.A certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with more skin in the game, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have strong insider backing.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Inflation Declines, Raising Interest Rate Cut Hopes: 5 Winners",
        "content": "Inflation started showing signs of decline in April and the downward movement has since continued. The Labor Department reported on Jul 11 that the monthly inflation rate fell in June for the first time in four years.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI), a broad measure of prices for goods and services across the economy, fell 0.1% month over month in June, after remaining unchanged in May and the first decline since May 2020.\n\nYear over year, CPI rose 3% in June after rising 3.3% in May, recording the smallest increase since June 2023. The June figures also beat the consensus estimate of a 0.1% monthly and a 3.1% year-over-year increase.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.1% sequentially in June and 3.3% from the year-ago levels, beating the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.2% and 3.4% respectively. The year-over-year rise in core CPI was the smallest since April 2021.\n\nJune\u2019s drop in inflation was driven by a sharp decline in gasoline prices, which fell 3.8% in June after falling 3.6% in the prior month. Shelter and food costs each rose at a moderate pace of 0.2%.\n\nInflation rose in the first quarter igniting fears that the Federal Reserve could continue with its monetary tightening policy for a longer period even after hiking interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022.\n\nHowever, in a big sigh of relief for both consumers and the Federal Reserve, inflation declined in the second quarter. Inflation has now fallen to a third from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3% in June 2024.\n\nThe sharp decline over the past couple of years is likely to draw the Federal Reserve another step closer to cutting interest rates in September. The Federal Reserve had earlier projected three rate cuts in 2024 but now sees only one.\n\nHowever, even a single 25 basis point interest rate cut has been positively received, especially since many in the market had anticipated no rate cuts in 2024.\n\nMoreover, the latest FOMC \"dot plot,\" suggests a planned cumulative reduction of 1% in interest rates by 2025, potentially taking the Fed funds rate down to 4.1% by the end of next year. Currently, markets are pricing a rate cut in September, with the possibility of another before the year-end if inflation continues to decline sharply.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, we have narrowed our search to four consumer discretionary stocks, such as YETI Holdings, Inc. YETI, The Toro Company TTC, Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH,which have strong potential for 2024.

        "title": "Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Skechers (SKX) Now",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nSkechers (SKX) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this shoe company a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Skechers is 21.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 16.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 13.2%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Skechers is 38.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -9.1%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 3.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Skechers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Skechers a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Skechers is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Skechers (SKX) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's Why",
        "content": "Skechers (SKX) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Skechers basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Skechers, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Skechers\n\nThis shoe company is expected to earn $4.08 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 16.9%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Skechers. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 6.7%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Skechers to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "SKX or NKE: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "Investors interested in Shoes and Retail Apparel stocks are likely familiar with Skechers (SKX) and Nike (NKE). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Skechers has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Nike has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that SKX has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nSKX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.35, while NKE has a forward P/E of 22.91. We also note that SKX has a PEG ratio of 0.95. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 1.86.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for SKX is its P/B ratio of 2.23. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NKE has a P/B of 7.59.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to SKX's Value grade of B and NKE's Value grade of F.\n\nSKX has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NKE, so it seems like value investors will conclude that SKX is the superior option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nWhile you may have an investing style you rely on, finding great stocks is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores. These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\n\nSkechers (SKX)\n\nFounded in 1992 and headquartered in Manhattan Beach, California, Skechers U.S.A., Inc. designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas under the SKECHERS name, as well as under several uniquely branded names.\n\nSKX is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, with a Value Style Score of B and VGM Score of B. Shares are currently trading at a forward P/E of 16.4X for the current fiscal year compared to the Shoes and Retail Apparel industry's P/E of 15.2X. Additionally, SKX has a PEG Ratio of 1 and a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 14X. Value investors should also note SKX's Price/Sales ratio of 1.2X.\n\nValue investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Two analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.06 to $4.08 per share. SKX has an average earnings surprise of 34.1%.\n\nWith strong valuation and earnings metrics, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, investors should strongly think about adding SKX to their portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com - Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK) tanked 4.9% on Wednesday, following cautionary remarks from M Science regarding a significant slowdown in growth for its Hoka and UGG brands in June.\n\nDespite the recent drop, Deckers' shares had seen a 40% upswing this year through Tuesday\u2019s close, making it the top-performing stock on the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fStay up to date with the latest company news using InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, click here to save over 50%!\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nIn contrast, M Science reported robust sell-through for Adidas (ETR:ADSGN) in the wholesale channel in the US and Europe throughout Q2, leading to a 2.4% rise in Adidas shares.\n\nBofA analysts issued a warning that after its first fiscal quarter, Deckers' UGG brand might face tougher comparisons and increased competition in the specialty running category, which could \"temper\" the magnitude of earnings beats.\n\nWhile analysts expect a strong Q1 report from the company, he anticipates this will be the last quarter where UGG significantly benefits from previous price increases and significantly lower discounting. Deckers is expected to report Q1 results later this month.\n\nIn a research note on Wednesday, BofA analysts observed that footwear stocks, including Deckers, Crocs Inc (NASDAQ:CROX), and Skechers USA Inc (NYSE:SKX), had retreated from recent highs, attributing this to tariff and freight-related risks, as well as \"recent volatility in the higher multiple athletic sector.\"\n\nHowever, Crocs and Skechers were identified as the most compelling buying opportunities. Both companies are also slated to post quarterly results later this month.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDeckers Outdoor plunges amid concerns over brand growth deceleration\n\nUS Senator Sanders optimistic Novo Nordisk can be pressured to cut Wegovy, Ozempic prices\n\nCitigroup hit with $136M in fines over data management issues\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cooling Labor Market Raises Rate Cut Hopes: 5 Stocks to Buy",
        "content": "The Wall Street rally has resumed, with all three major indexes hitting fresh all-time closing highs last week. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed 0.7%, 2% and 3.5% higher, respectively, last week on renewed optimism surrounding the Federal Reserve\u2019s planned rate cuts.\n\nThe optimism is being triggered by easing inflation and signs of a cooling labor market. The latest report from the Labor Department showed an uptick in unemployment and a slowdown in new job creation.\n\nNonfarm payrolls rose by 206,000 in June from a downwardly revised May figure of 218,000 from the earlier reported 272,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June after rising 4% in the prior month. Also, wages increased 3.9% year over year in June, the smallest gain since June 2021. Wage growth in a 3-3.5% range is considered consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation target of 2%.\n\nA tight labor market has been the biggest threat to the Fed in its fight to bring down inflation. However, the labor market has finally started showing signs of cooling and the tepid wage growth has raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will likely be able to check inflation without pushing the economy into a recession.\n\nAlso, inflation eased in April and May, raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could soon cut interest rates.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in his June post-FOMC meeting statement said that the central bank sees only a single 25 basis point rate cut this year, sharply lower than the three projected in its March meeting.\n\nEven a single 25 basis point rate cut is good news given that many market participants had started believing that there would be no rate cut this year.\n\nMoreover, the most recent FOMC \"dot plot\" predicts a 1% overall reduction in interest rates by 2025. Going by the forecast, the Fed funds rate is expected to drop to 4.1% by the end of 2025, which bodes well for the broader economy.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, we have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks, such as PlayAGS, Inc. AGS, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation FUN, OneSpaWorld Holdings OSW, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH and Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX, \u00a0which have strong potential for 2024.

        "title": "5 Low-Leverage Stocks to Buy Following Key Labor Data Release",
        "content": "Major stock indices in the United States ended on the green last Friday, following a key labor market data release, which came almost in line with market expectations.\u00a0 Notably, the latest data implied a 206,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls in June in the United States, which might have reignited Fed rate cut hopes among investors as reflected in an upward price movement in the share market.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, stock market players might be in the mood for some good investments. However, since the share market has lately been on edge, we recommend stocks like Vital Farms VITL, PulteGroup PHM, Atmos Energy ATO, Steelcase SCS and Skechers SKX, which have low leverage. Choosing them can shield investors from incurring huge losses in times of crisis.\n\nNow, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let\u2019s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.\n\nIn finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.\n\nHowever, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to excessive debt financing.\n\nThe crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.\n\nThe equity market can be volatile at times, and, as an investor, if you don\u2019t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks that bear low leverage and are, hence, less risky.\n\nTo identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears. The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.\n\nAnalyzing Debt/Equity\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n\nThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.\n\nWith the second-quarter earnings season ahead of us, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nConsidering the factors above, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.\n\nYet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.\n\nHere are the other parameters:\n\nDebt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.\r\n\r\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nPercentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock\u2019s price appreciation.\r\n\r\nVGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nEstimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.\n\nExcluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen.\n\nVital Farms: The company offers a range of produced pasture-raised foods, which include shell eggs, butter, hard-boiled eggs, ghee and liquid whole eggs.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nWest Ham United and Ghana National Team Winger Competing in Skechers Football Boots with the New Evolution Pack Now Taking the Brand Global\n\nLONDON, July 04, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Skechers brings more strength to the pitch by adding West Ham United and Ghana National Team winger Mohammed Kudus to its roster of elite players competing in Skechers Football boots. Known to fans by his nickname Star Boy, Kudus had already been seen playing in Skechers Razor\u2014the innovative speed boot that offers agility, comfort and touch\u2014and is now signed on as a Skechers athlete set to appear in multiplatform marketing campaigns supporting Skechers Football.\n\nKudus joins Team Skechers as the Company drops the Evolution Pack. The striking new colorway arrives just in time to celebrate a year since Skechers Football first entered the pitch and marks the brand\u2019s expansion to the global market where players around the world will have access to its signature Comfort That Performs for the first time. Part of the brand\u2019s fast evolution in the sport are the elite players who have made Skechers part of their game, including Harry Kane\u2014who is currently competing in Skechers Football boots at the UEFA Euro 2024.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been testing and competing in the Skechers Razor for a while now and it\u2019s evident to me that this is the best and most comfortable boot I\u2019ve ever worn,\" said Mohammed Kudus. \"It\u2019s the right time to make it official with Skechers, and I look forward to working with their team to help introduce this incredible brand to more players as they take Skechers Football around the world.\"\n\nAfter developing his talent at an academy in Ghana, Kudus made his professional debut at age 18 with Danish club Nordsj\u00e6lland. He later hit the global stage signing with Eredivisie club Ajax where he scored 17 goals before moving to Premier League club West Ham United in 2023. On the international stage, Kudus has scored 11 goals through 32 appearances with Ghana since 2019. His accolades include Eredivisie Team of the Month four times, and CAF (Confederation of African Football) Team of the Year as well as Ghana Footballer of the Year in 2023.\n\n\"Mohammed Kudus is a sensational player loved by fans around the world, and at age 23 is already known for his talent on the pitch, so he\u2019s the ideal athlete for Skechers,\" added Greg Smith, VP of Product Development and Merchandising for Skechers Performance. \"Along with Harry Kane and our entire team of elite athletes, it\u2019s clear that many of the best and brightest players in the world want to wear comfort that performs. Skechers Football boots offer innovation, performance and comfort that is unmatched on the pitch. As we grow our roster, we\u2019re introducing an expanded range of boots with Academy and Youth styles this summer\u2014a true evolution for Skechers Football going into our second season on the pitch.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Skechers Football range includes three Elite styles available in multiple colorways for men and women including the new Evolution Pack. The Skechers Razor is a lightweight speed boot with an explosive track-inspired design to maximize acceleration and energy return. It features a carbon-infused soleplate for responsive power and agility during play. The SKX_01 is ideal for striking the ball with a custom last meticulously crafted to optimize comfort and deliver a perfect fit for enhancing touch on the field. Both boots are available in standard low-profile with the SKX_01 also available in a high-top version.\n\nBeyond the Elite styles, Skechers will soon introduce a new line of entry boots perfect for all levels of play with maximized performance and comfort; as well as Youth and Kids boots for the next generation of players that want to emulate their favorite stars, featuring an adaptable fit and enhanced comfort in every pair. Both ranges will be available in firm ground and turf styles.\n\nSkechers Football launched at the start of the 2023/24 season when the brand signed Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane as the first pro to compete in the boot. Skechers has since expanded its roster with a number of Premier League athletes including Arsenal and Ukrainian National Team defender Oleksandr Zinchenko, Nottingham Forest and Swedish National Team forward Anthony Elanga, as well as additional men\u2019s and women\u2019s professional athletes globally.\n\nBeyond football, the Skechers team of elite athletes competing in the brand\u2019s performance footwear includes NBA stars Joel Embiid, Julius Randle and Terance Mann; golfers Matt Fitzpatrick and Brooke Henderson; Major League Baseball players Clayton Kershaw, Chris Taylor, Brendan Donovan, Aaron Nola, and Wade Miley; and pickleball pros Tyson McGuffin and Catherine Parenteau.\n\nThe Skechers Football collection is available at Skechers websites, select Skechers retail stores, as well as specialty football retailers worldwide.

        "title": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Adidas, Skechers, Caleres and Wolverine World Wide",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 3, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Adidas AG ADDYY, Skechers SKX, Caleres Inc. CRI and Wolverine World Wide WWW.\n\nIndustry: Retail Apparel and Shoes\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2296020/4-steady-shoes-retail-apparel-stocks-in-a-troubled-industry\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry continues to deal with hardships from elevated costs, reduced spending trends on discretionary items and increased marketing investments. These headwinds have been the key burdens on the participating companies' profits. Additionally, adverse currency movements threaten industry players due to their worldwide presence.\n\nHowever, the industry looks lucrative owing to rising consumer awareness about leading a healthy lifestyle, which has resulted in positive demand trends for activewear and athletic shoes. New and innovative designs have been the key drivers for the industry participants. Players focused on product innovation, store expansion, digital investments and omnichannel growth are expected to gain. Investments in products and e-commerce portals bode well for players like Adidas AG, Skechers, Caleres Inc. and Wolverine World Wide.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry comprises companies that design, source and market clothing, footwear and accessories for men, women and children under various brand names. Product offerings of the companies mostly include athletic and casual footwear, fashion apparel and activewear, sports equipment, bags, balls, and other sports and fashion accessories.\n\nThe companies showcase their products through their branded outlets and websites. Some companies distribute products via other retail stores, such as national chains, online retailers, sporting goods stores, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs.\n\nA Look at What's Shaping the Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry's Future\n\nCost Headwinds: Companies in the industry are witnessing elevated costs due to factors like commodity cost inflation and reinvestments. Supply-chain constraints and elevated logistic costs have been acting as deterrents. Many companies expect increased logistic costs to hurt margins in the near term. Elevated marketing expenses, higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses and increased investments to enhance store and digital operations have been raising SG&A costs.\n\nAlso, industry participants are witnessing rising costs to support brand campaigns and digital investments. The exit from the Russia business due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict is likely to be the key concern for some players. A tough and competitive labor market is another headwind. These factors pose a threat to the industry players' margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumer Demand Trends: Players in the industry have been benefiting from strong consumer demand for activewear/athleisure products and footwear. The trend is expected to continue in 2024. Athletic goods and apparel companies offer products from footwear, sweatshirts, leggings, pants, jackets and tops to yoga wear and running clothes for men and women.\n\nThe increasing focus on fashion is boosting the demand for innovative clothes and footwear in the United States. Industry participants have been focused on product innovations, active promotions, store expansion and enhancing e-commerce capabilities to gain market share. Favorable health and wellness trends have been the key to inspiring footwear manufacturers to expand their product portfolios.\n\nThe companies continue to innovate styles, materials and colors and incorporate functional designs to grab a large share of the fast-growing market. Multi-functional shoes, which cater to casual and formal looks, have been gaining popularity.\n\nE-Commerce Investments: E-commerce has been playing a crucial role in the athleisure market's growth. The companies in the market segment are looking to build a customer base through websites, social media and other digital channels. As consumers continue to shop from home, the growth of athletic-inspired apparel and digital sales are likely to continue.\n\nCompanies focused on expanding their athletic-based apparel lines and building on e-commerce capabilities are expected to witness growth in the long run. Efforts to accelerate deliveries through investments in supply chains and order fulfillment avenues are likely to provide an edge to industry players.\n\nSimultaneously, companies are investing in renovations and improved checkouts, as well as mobile point-of-sale capabilities, to make stores attractive. Efforts to enhance experiences through multiple channels are likely to contribute significantly to improving traffic and transactions in stores and online.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is an 11-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #164, which places it in the bottom 34% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull prospects for the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry vs. Sector\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry has underperformed the sector and the S&P 500 in the past year.\n\nStocks in the industry have collectively declined 28%. The Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite have risen 2.7% and 23.7%, respectively.\n\nShoes and Retail Apparel Industry's Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), commonly used for valuing Consumer Discretionary stocks, the industry is currently trading at 18.28X compared with the S&P 500's 21.5X and the sector's 16.6X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry traded as high as 37.75X and as low as 18.28X, with a median of 27.01X.\n\n4 Shoes & Retail Apparel Stocks to Watch\n\nWolverine: Wolverine is engaged in the designing, manufacturing and distribution of a wide variety of casual as well as active apparel and footwear.

Strong performances of CAL's emerging brands, including Vionic, Sam Edelman, Allen Edmonds and Blowfish Malibu, are expected to be growth drivers.\n\nManagement anticipates the strong performance of the Famous Footwear brand and gains from the Brand Portfolio segments, leveraging a diversified brand model and the continued execution of strategic priorities to aid CAL's performance. Caleres' focus on consumers' evolving preferences and efforts to drive growth across its omnichannel ecosystem bode well.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAL's fiscal 2024 sales and earnings indicates growth of 0.7% and 5.3%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter's reported figures.

        "title": "4 Steady Shoes &amp; Retail Apparel Stocks in a Troubled Industry",
        "content": "The Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry continues to deal with hardships from elevated costs, reduced spending trends on discretionary items and increased marketing investments. These headwinds have been the key burdens on the participating companies\u2019 profits. Additionally, adverse currency movements threaten industry players due to their worldwide presence.\r\n\r\nHowever, the industry looks lucrative owing to rising consumer awareness about leading a healthy lifestyle, which has resulted in positive demand trends for activewear and athletic shoes. New and innovative designs have been the key drivers for the industry participants. Players focused on product innovation, store expansion, digital investments and omnichannel growth are expected to gain. Investments in products and e-commerce portals bode well for players like Adidas AG ADDYY, Skechers SKX, Caleres Inc. CRI and Wolverine World Wide WWW.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry comprises companies that design, source and market clothing, footwear and accessories for men, women and children under various brand names. Product offerings of the companies mostly include athletic and casual footwear, fashion apparel and activewear, sports equipment, bags, balls, and other sports and fashion accessories. The companies showcase their products through their branded outlets and websites. Some companies distribute products via other retail stores, such as national chains, online retailers, sporting goods stores, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs.\n\nA Look at What's Shaping the Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry's Future\n\nCost Headwinds: Companies in the industry are witnessing elevated costs due to factors like commodity cost inflation and reinvestments. Supply-chain constraints and elevated logistic costs have been acting as deterrents. Many companies expect increased logistic costs to hurt margins in the near term. Elevated marketing expenses, higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses and increased investments to enhance store and digital operations have been raising SG&A costs. Also, industry participants are witnessing rising costs to support brand campaigns and digital investments. The exit from the Russia business due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict is likely to be the key concern for some players. A tough and competitive labor market is another headwind. These factors pose a threat to the industry players\u2019 margins.\r\n\r\nConsumer Demand Trends:Players in the industry have been benefiting from strong consumer demand for activewear/athleisure products and footwear. The trend is expected to continue in 2024. Athletic goods and apparel companies offer products from footwear, sweatshirts, leggings, pants, jackets and tops to yoga wear and running clothes for men and women. The increasing focus on fashion is boosting the demand for innovative clothes and footwear in the United States. Industry participants have been focused on product innovations, active promotions, store expansion and enhancing e-commerce capabilities to gain market share. Favorable health and wellness trends have been the key to inspiring footwear manufacturers to expand their product portfolios. The companies continue to innovate styles, materials and colors and incorporate functional designs to grab a large share of the fast-growing market. Multi-functional shoes, which cater to casual and formal looks, have been gaining popularity.\r\n\r\nE-Commerce Investments: E-commerce has been playing a crucial role in the athleisure market\u2019s growth. The companies in the market segment are looking to build a customer base through websites, social media and other digital channels. As consumers continue to shop from home, the growth of athletic-inspired apparel and digital sales are likely to continue. Companies focused on expanding their athletic-based apparel lines and building on e-commerce capabilities are expected to witness growth in the long run. Efforts to accelerate deliveries through investments in supply chains and order fulfillment avenues are likely to provide an edge to industry players. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovations and improved checkouts, as well as mobile point-of-sale capabilities, to make stores attractive. Efforts to enhance experiences through multiple channels are likely to contribute significantly to improving traffic and transactions in stores and online.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is an 11-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #164, which places it in the bottom 34% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull prospects for the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential.\r\n\r\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s look at the industry\u2019s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry vs. Sector\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry has underperformed the sector and the S&P 500 in the past year.\r\n\r\nStocks in the industry have collectively declined 28%. The Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite have risen 2.7% and 23.7%, respectively.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nShoes and Retail Apparel Industry's Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), commonly used for valuing Consumer Discretionary stocks, the industry is currently trading at 18.28X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 21.5X and the sector\u2019s 16.6X.\r\n\r\nOver the last five years, the industry traded as high as 37.75X and as low as 18.28X, with a median of 27.01X, as the chart below shows.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio (Past 5 Years)\n\n4 Shoes & Retail Apparel Stocks to Watch\n\nWolverine: Wolverine is engaged in the designing, manufacturing and distribution of a wide variety of casual as well as active apparel and footwear. The company also manufactures children\u2019s footwear and specially designed boots and accessories for industrial purposes. Its focus on brand structure, increasing efficiency by removing costs, strategic review of its portfolio, improving working capital and lowering leverage bode well. Wolverine continues to focus on strengthening its DTC business. Speed-to-market initiatives, deployment of digital product development tools, expansion of e-commerce platforms and frequent introduction of products are steadily contributing to its performance.\r\n\r\nManagement looks forward to generating $150 million of annual cost savings for 2024, which is likely to be invested in growth brands. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WWW\u2019s 2024 earnings is pegged at 80 cents per share, which indicates significant growth from 5 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for WWW\u2019s 2024 EPS has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The company has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 6.3%, on average.

The company\u2019s emphasis on new product lines, store remodeling projects, cost-containment efforts, inventory management and global distribution platform bodes well. SKX is focused on executing its long-term growth strategy, with a diverse assortment of innovative and comfortable products. This is expected to drive its top line in the near and long term.\r\n\r\nSkechers is investing strategically to improve infrastructure worldwide, primarily in e-commerce platforms and distribution centers. The company\u2019s international business is a significant sales growth driver. SKX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 34.1%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the footwear company\u2019s 2024 sales and earnings indicates growth of 10.6% and 16.9%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figures.

The company operates through Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments. The Saint Louis, MO-based company has been benefiting from positive consumer demand trends and accelerated recovery in the footwear marketplace, aiding its sales. The momentum in the Famous Footwear brand is expected to contribute meaningfully to sales growth. Strong performances of CAL\u2019s emerging brands, including Vionic, Sam Edelman, Allen Edmonds and Blowfish Malibu, are expected to be growth drivers.\r\n\r\nManagement anticipates the strong performance of the Famous Footwear brand and gains from the Brand Portfolio segments, leveraging a diversified brand model and the continued execution of strategic priorities to aid CAL\u2019s performance. Caleres' focus on consumers' evolving preferences and efforts to drive growth across its omnichannel ecosystem bode well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAL\u2019s fiscal 2024 sales and earnings indicates growth of 0.7% and 5.3%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figures. The consensus estimate for CAL\u2019s fiscal 2024 EPS has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.9%, on average.

Adidas has been benefiting from improved sell-through of all Adidas products in the market. Moreover, the company has been witnessing improved margins, driven by the recently implemented price increases and an improved channel mix.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADDYY\u2019s 2024 sales indicates growth of 5.1% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.

        "title": "Why Skechers (SKX) Dipped More Than Broader Market Today",
        "content": "The latest trading session saw Skechers (SKX) ending at $69.12, denoting a -1.03% adjustment from its last day's close. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.41%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.71%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the shoe company had lost 0.82% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 2.29% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.53% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Skechers in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on July 25, 2024. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $0.92, signifying a 6.12% drop compared to the same quarter of the previous year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $2.21 billion, reflecting a 10.04% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $4.08 per share and a revenue of $8.85 billion, indicating changes of +16.91% and +10.57%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Skechers. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.55% upward. Skechers is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Skechers has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.11 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 16.18, so one might conclude that Skechers is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nMeanwhile, SKX's PEG ratio is currently 1. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Shoes and Retail Apparel industry stood at 1.72 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 46, which puts it in the top 19% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See Skechers (SKX) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Skechers (SKX).\n\nSkechers currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.25, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.25 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 8.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SKX Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for SKX\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Skechers here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Skechers, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in SKX?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Skechers, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6% over the past month to $4.08.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Skechers.

        "title": "Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Skechers (SKX) is a Great Choice",
        "content": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Skechers (SKX), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Skechers currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if SKX is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this shoe company holds up.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor SKX, shares are up 0.62% over the past week while the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is up 0.56% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 3.34% compares favorably with the industry's 1.29% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Skechers have increased 23.68% over the past quarter, and have gained 44.69% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.17% and 27.42%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of SKX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, SKX is averaging 1,868,063 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with SKX.\n\nOver the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SKX's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.00 to $4.08 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that SKX is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Skechers on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 7 Smartest Consumer Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now",
        "content": "Consumers have rarely been under the kind of pressure they face today. Unemployment in May crept up to 4% while inflation stood at 3.3%, unchanged from the month before. With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady at 5.25% to 5.5%, the cost of borrowing remains high.\n\nThat\u2019s like why the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index fell 5% from April. Many of the jobs being created are just part-time employment forcing families to work two jobs (or more) just to make ends meet. Consumers are forced to turn to using credit cards but delinquencies are on the rise. The Fed says 9% of all credit cards and 8% of auto loans are delinquent.\n\nIt\u2019s a gloomy backdrop and stands at odds with the go-go sentiment on Wall Street. As the market indices hit new all-time highs, consumers are whistling past the graveyard.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors, though, can use that to their advantage. While shoppers are reining in their spending to focus on basics, it is uneven as a number of businesses show strength. Below are seven top consumer stocks to buy now that are profiting from the dicey economy.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) continues to prove its resilience in all markets. It remains profitable even as sales slumped 6.5% due to same-store sales falling 6.1%. Earnings rose to $1.20 per share from $1.15 a year ago. Best Buy stock, however, is up 15% year-to-date and 25% high since reporting earnings one month ago.\n\nThere is good reason for the optimism. The PC market is basically at rock bottom with the potential for a significant sales boost to come. That\u2019s because artificial intelligence (AI) PCs are starting to hit store shelves. They promise to revitalize the market with new power and capabilities that hasn\u2019t been seen in many years.\n\nThe latest AI PC chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will be released in the coming months and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be bringing its AI-powered M4 chip to all MacBooks.\n\nComputers still account for a large percentage of Best Buy\u2019s revenue. Although segment revenue fell 13% in the first quarter, there could be a surge on the horizon. But even if it doesn\u2019t materialize, Best Buy has shown it is able to navigate treacherous waters profitably.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading global online travel agent Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is the next consumer stocks to buy now. Despite a glum economy, travel remains a bright spot. Certainly the \u201crevenge travel\u201d phenomenon that followed the pandemic has run its course but the industry is still forecasting growth. While demand this year will be as robust as it was in 2023, consumers are seeking out maximum value for their dollars spent. Booking\u2019s family of platforms helps them achieve it.\n\nStory continues\n\nBooking operates some of the largest travel platforms in the world, including Agoda, Priceline.com and Kayak. It offers an extensive network of properties in almost every country globally making it a natural to attract the largest percentage of travelers.\n\nGlobal room nights increased 17% in 2023 from the year before and are now 24% above 2019 pre-pandemic levels. They increased another 9% in the first quarter while rental car days jumped 11% and airline ticket growth soared 33% from the year-ago period.\n\nTravel could very well be pinched if the economy deteriorates further. If inflation doesn\u2019t start heading appreciably lower and the Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates or not as much as expected, it could hurt travel and tourism. But for those who can and will travel, turning to Booking Holdings for the opportunity will make it smooth sailing.\n\nCrocs (CROX) The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nSource: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nFootwear specialist Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) stumbled over the acquisition last year of the HeyDude brand but quickly picked itself up and dusted itself off. Due to the ongoing strength of its core plastic shoe, CROX stock is up 65% in 2024 and has doubled off its 52-week low.\n\nIt seems hard to believe the staying power of Crocs shoes. Initially a favorite amongst healthcare workers and others who were on their feet all day, the brand found favor in all segments of the market, even internationally. Sales in foreign markets are growing faster than domestic sales and have almost reached parity.\n\nAt the start of the year I noted how robust Crocs brand sales were and highlighted the stock\u2019s very attractive valuations. \u201cThis is a deeply discounted stock with a still-valuable brand name that can run higher,\u201d I wrote at the time but the case remains true today.\n\nDespite the phenomenal run-up in the stock, Crocs still trades at 11 times trailing earnings and estimates, goes for twice its sales and a bargain-basement 11x the free cash flow (FCF) it produces. CROX stock will wear out a lot of shoe leather as it runs higher from here.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) Hands holding a smartphone with the Genuine Parts (GPC) logo displayed.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAftermarket auto parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) is a stock primed to take advantage of this dicey economy and any recovery that follows.\n\nElevated inflation and interest rates have taken a toll on both new and used car sales. Although prices are down from their post-pandemic record, financing a new car is still too expensive. Dealers are resorting to incentives once again to lure in buyers and reduce rising inventories. It\u2019s not much better for used car values either as those dealer incentives keep buyers away from used car lots.\n\nIt makes it better just to keep your existing car working. The average age of all vehicles on the road has crept up to 12.6 years but for cars it stands at 14 years. Buying parts to keep them working is keeping Genuine Parts busy. It operates the NAPA Auto Parts chain of retail stores.\n\nGlobal automotive sales rose 2% in the first quarter to $3.6 billion with segment profits rising 3.2% to $273 million.\n\nThe auto parts stock raised its full-year earnings guidance to $9.88 per share at the midpoint from its previous estimate of $9.80 per share. With the stock up less than 2% in 2024 and trading at just 13 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates Genuine Parts is a solid consumer stock to buy.\n\nSkechers (SKX) photo of man practicing parkour, jumping on tall cement wall in black sneakers\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/areporter\n\nAnother footwear specialist deserving your attention is sneaker-maker Skechers (NYSE:SKX). The company is targeting $10 billion in sales eventually and while the North American market remains an important component of that, it is sales to international markets that will push it over the threshold.\n\nForeign sales of Skechers sneakers represent 65% of total revenue of $2.25 billion, which was a company record. They are also growing twice as fast as domestic sales, 15.2% versus 7.8%. More importantly, the direct-to-consumer (DTC) market is what is firing that growth, here and abroad. That\u2019s key because DTC sales cut out the middleman and boost profits. Gross profit margins on DTC sales stands at 65.7% whereas the wholesale market is 44.7%.\n\nThe growth also suggests Skechers hasn\u2019t lost any consumer mindshare over the years. They still find its footwear desirable and are willing to pay up for it.\n\nSkechers stock is up 15% year-to-date and more than 56% above recent lows. Yet shares still trade at an attractive 11 times earnings estimates, less than twice sales and 17x FCF.\n\nChewy (CHWY) chewy mobile app open screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to the American Pet Products Association, U.S. owners will spend $150.6 billion on their pets this year, up 2.4% from the $147 billion they spent in 2023. The greaterst percentage will be spent on food and treats, or some $64.4 billion, with another $38.3 billion going to veterinarian care and products.\n\nThat plays to the strengths of online petcare retailer Chewy (NASDAQ:CHWY). The majority of its sales come from pet food and treats but also supplies, pet medications and petcare products. The retailer is also expanding into new channels such as veterinary clinics, which hold the promise of higher margins. In April, Chewy opened its first two clinics and more are expected soon.\n\nBecause of the ongoing trend towards humanizing our pets, consumers are willing to spend more and pay up, whether its for food, toys or vet care. It provides a large, motivating force behind Chewy stock. Shares have bounced 70% off their 52-week low but with renewed sales strength the stock should go higher still.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt looked as though e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) had run its course. The cosmetics and beauty care company had tripled in value last year but after starting off 2024 strong, stumbled hard. Shares lost more than a quarter of their value. That\u2019s now a thing of the past. ELF stock is up 42% year-to-date and should keep charging ahead.\n\nAs I noted last month before the rebound, teens view e.l.f. Beauty as the No. 1 cosmetics brand in the country. According to Piper Sandler\u2019s Taking Stock With Teens semi-annual survey, e.l.f. has a 38% share of the market, 16 percentage points more than the next leading brand. And teens are spending more money on cosmetics than at any time since 2018. The survey found teens are spending an average of $339 on cosmetics.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at $205 per share and though it looks expensive at 98 times earnings, that very much in line with its average over the past five years. It is somewhat elevated over the period since it went public but a good argument could be made that it is worth the premium being charged.\n\nParticularly during difficult economic times, cosmetics are an items consumers are willing to splurge on. e.l.f. Beauty remains a smart consumer stock to buy today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in GPC stock.

        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nSkechers (SKX) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this shoe company a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Skechers is 21.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 16.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 13.2%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Skechers is 38.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -9.1%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 3.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Skechers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.5% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Skechers a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Skechers is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "SKX vs. BIRK: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?",
        "content": "Investors with an interest in Shoes and Retail Apparel stocks have likely encountered both Skechers (SKX) and Birkenstock (BIRK). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Skechers has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Birkenstock has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that SKX has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nSKX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.15, while BIRK has a forward P/E of 44.76. We also note that SKX has a PEG ratio of 1.06. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. BIRK currently has a PEG ratio of 1.86.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for SKX is its P/B ratio of 2.48. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, BIRK has a P/B of 4.05.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help SKX earn a Value grade of B, while BIRK has been given a Value grade of F.\n\nSKX is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that SKX is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nSkechers (SKX)\n\nFounded in 1992 and headquartered in Manhattan Beach, California, Skechers U.S.A., Inc. designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas under the SKECHERS name, as well as under several uniquely branded names.\n\nSKX sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), holds a Value Style Score of B, and has a VGM Score of A. Compared to the Shoes and Retail Apparel industry's P/E of 17X, shares of Skechers are trading at a forward P/E of 18.2X. SKX also has a PEG Ratio of 1.1, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 15.6X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 1.4X.\n\nValue investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Five analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.19 to $4.08 per share. SKX has an average earnings surprise of 34.1%.\n\nInvestors should take the time to consider SKX for their portfolios due to its solid Zacks Ranks, notable earnings and valuation metrics, and impressive Value and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "4 Top-Ranked Stocks Showing Signs of Relative Price Strength",
        "content": "U.S. stock markets have continued their upward trajectory into the first half of 2024, building on a remarkable 2023. The S&P 500 has seen an impressive gain of 15.4% year to date and more than 1% in June itself. On Thursday, the benchmark crossed a historic milestone, breaching the 5,500 mark for the first time and reaching an all-time high of 5,505.35. As a matter of fact, the S&P 500 Index has achieved 32 record highs this year alone.\r\n\r\nRecent months have shown favorable inflation data, indicating that peak inflation is behind us, while the labor market remains strong. Additionally, the global supply chain is gradually improving as U.S. corporations adapt and reschedule around China. Despite high inflation and interest rates, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain robust.\r\n\r\nIn a post-FOMC meeting statement on Jun 12, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a potential 25-basis-point rate cut this year, with a full 1% reduction in 2025. This optimistic outlook makes relative price strength a compelling tool for investment, leveraging market momentum and economic resilience to drive potential gains.\n\nRelative Price Strength Strategy\n\nWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.\r\n\r\nUpon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.\r\n\r\nHowever, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures a winning option on your hands.\r\n\r\nThen again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter\u2019s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nRelative % Price change \u2013 12 weeks greater than 0\r\n\r\nRelative % Price change \u2013 4 weeks greater than 0\r\n\r\nRelative % Price change \u2013 1 week greater than 0\r\n\r\n(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)\r\n\r\n% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks \u2014 that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years \u2014 can get through. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.\r\n\r\nVGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nHere are the four stocks that made it through the screen:\r\n\r\nChewy, Inc. CHWY: The company is an online seller of pet products and services in the United States and Canada. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings of Chewy indicates 37.7% growth.

WFC and Palomar Holdings PLMR.\n\n4 Top Stocks Worth a Buy for Superrb Earnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is the highest priority for any organization. This is because if a start-up or well-known company doesn't make money, it won't last long.\n\nSo, what is earnings growth? Study a company's revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing share price. But, expectations of earnings play a significant role.\n\nEarnings Estimates & Share Price Movements\n\nFrequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company's earnings failing to meet market expectations.\n\nEarnings estimates embody analysts' opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.\n\nThus, investors should look for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.\n\nHere are the best four stocks that stand out:\n\nSkechers designs, develops, markets and distributes footwear for men, women and children. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). SKX's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 16.9%. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican restaurant chains. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "content": "Earnings growth is the highest priority for any organization. This is because if a start-up or well-known company doesn\u2019t make money, it won\u2019t last long.\n\nSo, what is earnings growth? Study a company\u2019s revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing share price. But, expectations of earnings play a significant role.\n\nEarnings Estimates & Share Price Movements\n\nFrequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company\u2019s earnings failing to meet market expectations.\n\nEarnings estimates embody analysts\u2019 opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.\n\nThus, investors should look for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.\n\nScreening Measures:\n\nTo shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)\n\n5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (stocks with a strong EPS growth history).\n\n% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (companies that saw year-over-year earnings growth of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal).\n\n% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).\n\n% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week).\n\n% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).\n\nThe above criteria narrowed the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only eight. Here are the best four stocks that stand out:\n\nSkechers SKX designs, develops, markets and distributes footwear for men, women and children. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). SKX\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 16.9%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill CMG operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican restaurant chains. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). CMG\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 23.3%.\n\nWells Fargo & Company WFC is one of the largest financial services companies in the United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. WFC\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 9.5%.\n\nPalomar Holdings PLMR is an insurance holding company. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1. PLMR\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26%.\n\nYou can sign up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

HAE, AZZ Inc. AZZ and BOK Financial Corp BOKF.\n\nBuy 5 Stocks with Upgraded Broker Ratings for Robust Returns\n\nGiven the current solid market performance, it is very difficult for retail investors to choose stocks independently and generate robust returns. For this, one has to understand the fundamentals of a company and try to place them against the present economic background to figure out how it may fare as an investment.\n\nOne way to cut short this task is to follow brokers\u2019 recommendations. So, stocks like Skechers U.S.A., Inc., Walmart Inc., Haemonetics Corp., AZZ Inc. and BOK Financial Corp are worth betting on.\n\nAs brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper insight into what is happening in a particular company. They assess companies\u2019 publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.\n\nBrokers have more understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.\n\nWhen brokers upgrade a stock, one can easily rely on their judgment. But merely depending on broker upgrades is not the correct way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into account to ensure steady returns.\n\nHere are five stocks that qualified for the screening:\n\nBased in Manhattan Beach, CA, Skechers U.S.A. designs, develops, markets and distributes footwear for men, women and children in the United States and overseas under the SKECHERS name, as well as under several uniquely branded names.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Netflix, Royal  Caribbean Cruises, Roblox, Skechers and SharkNinja",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 13, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix Inc. NFLX, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Roblox Corp. RBLX, Skechers U.S.A. Inc. SKX and SharkNinja Inc. SN.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy Despite Weak Run\n\nWall Street has moved mostly sideways so far in June after rallying strongly last month. However, the overall performance of U.S. stock markets remains quite exciting. Meanwhile, the consumer discretionary sector, which jumped significantly last year, has failed to maintain its momentum in 2024.\n\nOut of the 11 broad sectors of the market\u2019s benchmark \u2014 the S&P 500 Index \u2014 the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR is down 0.3% year to date. This sector is the second worst performer so far this year after Real Estate Select Sector SPDR, which tumbled 4.7%.\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector comprises businesses that sell goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers. These are the products that consumers can avoid without any major consequences to their well-being. In fact, these goods are desirable only if the available income of an individual is sufficient to purchase them.\n\nMoreover, the sector is generally recognized as being growth-oriented. Notably, growth sectors are highly sensitive to the movement of the market interest rate and are inversely related. In the first half of 2023, the Fed first reduced the magnitude of interest rate hike and finally stopped raising rates in July 2023. Consequently, the consumer discretionary sector flourished.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, market participants are expecting a reduction in the Fed fund rate by 3-4 times of 25 basis points each. However, nothing has happened so far, and the benchmark lending rate has remained static in the range of 5.25-5.5%, marking the 23-year high level, since July 2023.\n\nAt present, investors are highly concerned that the Fed may maintain the same range of interest rate throughout 2024. A sticky inflation rate, a resilient labor market, higher wage rates and better-than-expected earnings results have created jitters among Fed members regarding a rate cut. As a result, the consumer discretionary space has been facing hurdles.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nDespite these headwinds, a handful of consumer discretionary stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank have the potential to provide good returns in the second half of 2024. We have chosen five such large-cap consumer discretionary stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNetflix Inc. added 9.33 million paid subscribers globally in first-quarter 2024, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.\n\nNFLX is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.8% and 52.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. has been benefiting from strong cruising demand from new and loyal guests and robust booking trends. Moreover, RCL gains from strength in consumer spending onboard and pre-cruise purchases.\n\nRCL emphasized investing in a modern digital travel platform to streamline the vacation booking process for customers and expand wallet share.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last seven days.\n\nSharkNinja Inc. is a product design and technology company engaged in the provision of various solutions for consumers worldwide. SN sells its products through traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels and e-commerce channels, distributors, and direct-to-consumer channels under the Shark and Ninja brands.\n\nSN offers cleaning appliances as well as other floorcare products, cooking and beverage appliances, food preparation appliances as well as home environment products comprising air purifiers and humidifiers.\n\nZacks Rank #1 SharkNinja has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.8% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in Skechers (SKX) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Skechers (SKX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nSkechers currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.30, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 10 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.30 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 10 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 80% and 10% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SKX Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for SKX\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Skechers here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Skechers, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs SKX Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Skechers, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $4.07.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Skechers.

        "content": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX continues to lead the market through its strategic emphasis on a varied brand lineup, cutting-edge digital capabilities, and ambitious global expansion plans. The company\u2019s well-devised growth strategies, particularly in its direct-to-consumer (DTC) and international segments, not only demonstrate its agility in responding to shifting consumer tastes but also bolster its potential for sustained growth and market dominance.\n\nExploring the Details\n\nTo maintain its competitive edge and meet sales goals, Skechers is dedicated to strategic investments in infrastructure and technology. This includes plans to open retail locations, enhance omnichannel capabilities and build a second distribution center in China. These initiatives aim to improve operational efficiency and extend the company's global reach. Skechers' financial stability and strategic investments reflect a strong path to achieve its operational and financial targets in 2024 and beyond.\r\n\r\nSkechers continues to diversify its extensive product portfolio, which includes styles ranging from fashion and athletic to non-athletic and work footwear. The strategy of managing multiple brands simultaneously enables the company to launch products without impacting existing ones, thereby attracting a broader customer base. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSKX is intensifying its digital initiatives by upgrading website features, mobile apps, and customer loyalty programs. By integrating in-store and online experiences, Skechers aims to provide a seamless shopping journey that drives sales volumes. Improvements to point-of-sale systems are also underway to enhance customer interactions both online and in physical stores, boosting sales and customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the DTC segment saw a 17.3% year-over-year increase in sales, reaching $829.9 million in the first quarter of 2024. This robust growth is evident across both physical stores and e-commerce platforms, driven by effective marketing strategies and continuous product innovations, particularly in comfort technologies.\r\n\r\nSkechers' international business operations have been a pivotal driver of its overall growth trajectory. The company\u2019s success in the global markets reflects its ability to adapt to diverse consumer preferences, capitalize on emerging trends and leverage effective distribution strategies tailored to each region's unique dynamics.\r\n\r\nInternational sales grew 15.2% year over year in the first quarter, accounting for 64.5% of the total sales. The APAC region, in particular, saw growth of 15.9%, reflecting the company\u2019s ability to adapt to diverse consumer preferences and leverage emerging market trends.\n\nStory continues\n\nOptimistic Outlook\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Skechers forecasts sales between $8.73 billion and $8.88 billion, revised upward from the previously mentioned $8.6-$8.8 billion. This projection represents a significant increase from the $8 billion in sales recorded in fiscal 2023. Additionally, the company anticipates earnings per share between $3.95 and $4.10, suggesting growth from the $3.49 reported in the previous year.\r\n\r\nSkechers plans to allocate between $325 million and $375 million for capital expenditure. This investment will support key strategic initiatives, such as store openings, omnichannel capability expansion and distribution infrastructure enhancements. The company is confidently progressing toward its ambitious goal of achieving $10 billion in annual sales by 2026.\n\nZacks Rank & Estimates\n\nThis Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has demonstrated remarkable market performance over the past year, significantly outpacing the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry.

        "title": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX) Upgraded by Bank of America",
        "content": "We recently compiled the list of the 10 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX)\u00a0stands against the other stocks that received an upgrade from Wall Street analysts. But first, we are going to take a look at what the markets are doing.\n\nThe major index futures are slightly in the red this morning. The euro's descent to a one-month low comes as a culmination of broader geopolitical shifts, notably triggered by French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call for a legislative vote following his party's stinging defeat in the European Parliament election. Macron's move injected fresh uncertainty into the European political landscape, prompting a cautious retreat among investors and weakening the common currency by 0.4%. The ripple effect extended beyond currency markets, manifesting in European equities and French bonds, where nervous sentiment led to significant sell-offs.\n\nThis was particularly evident in the banking sector, with major institutions like BNP Paribas SA and Societe Generale SA witnessing sharp declines of over 5%, reflecting the apprehension surrounding the potential political ramifications. Meanwhile, the global financial community remains on high alert as they await the outcomes of the upcoming Federal Reserve meetings later in the week. Market participants are scrutinizing every indication and statement from the Fed, acutely aware of the potential impact on monetary policy and its reverberations across various asset classes. In a separate arena, the UK's political landscape is also under scrutiny, with anticipation building ahead of the upcoming election. The findings from the Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey underscore the complex interplay between politics and currency markets, suggesting that a Labour victory could inject renewed optimism into the pound. However, lingering uncertainties surrounding the long-term implications of Brexit cast a shadow over the potential benefits, leaving investors cautiously optimistic.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the dominance of Big Tech in driving market momentum is undergoing closer examination. While technology giants have spearheaded the recent market rally, concerns about a slowdown in profit growth have prompted a broader conversation about the need for diversified investment strategies. This recalibration underscores the importance of resilience and adaptability in navigating evolving market dynamics.\n\nThe resilience observed in the US financial markets amidst the Federal Reserve's extended period of unchanged policy rates, hovering between 5.25% to 5.5% for nearly a year, can be attributed to a confluence of factors reshaping the economic landscape. One notable transformation is the evolving financing dynamics, where non-traditional private funding sources are gaining traction over conventional public markets. This shift, driven by tighter regulations on public institutions, has seen entities such as pension funds and family offices increasingly injecting capital directly into the market, thereby reducing systemic risks due to their less visible nature and mitigating the potential for widespread market disruptions. Furthermore, the prominence of government spending, predominantly financed through debt, has emerged as a critical driver of economic expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike previous cycles reliant on corporate or household borrowing, the current phase witnesses a marked role reversal, with government expenditure taking the lead. This shift, while bolstering economic activity, also introduces a degree of stability, given the perception of government debt as a safer investment owing to the state's ability to levy taxes. However, concerns linger about the long-term sustainability of this trajectory, particularly amidst rising interest rates and mounting fiscal imbalances, necessitating careful monitoring and proactive fiscal management strategies. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's strategic approach to managing risks has played a pivotal role in maintaining relatively easy financial conditions, shielding the economy from abrupt downturns. Despite signaling a restrictive policy stance through interest rate hikes and reductions in its bond portfolio, the Fed remains vigilant to downside risks, intervening swiftly to mitigate potential shocks. This proactive stance, coupled with clear communication strategies, has contributed to sustaining market confidence and preventing the emergence of widespread financial instability. However, amidst the seemingly positive developments, caution is warranted as challenges persist, particularly in less visible sectors such as fintech lending and income inequality. The shadow banking system's resilience and consumers' ability to weather downturns without the safety nets of paycheck protection and stimulus checks remain uncertain, underscoring the importance of continued vigilance and adaptive policymaking to navigate potential vulnerabilities and sustain long-term economic stability.\n\nOn the precious metal side, the World Gold Council reports a challenging landscape for the gold mining industry as reserves of the precious metal become increasingly scarce. According to the Council's data, mine production only saw a marginal increase of 0.5% in 2023 compared to the previous year. John Reade, Chief Market Strategist at the World Gold Council, highlights that while there was a 4% year-on-year increase in first-quarter mine production in 2024, overall production has plateaued since 2016-2018. This stagnation follows a decade of rapid growth starting from around 2008, reported CNBC. The scarcity of new gold deposits is a primary concern, with many prospective areas already explored. Large-scale gold mining requires significant capital investment, exploration, and development, with an average lead time of 10 to 20 years before production can commence. Additionally, obtaining government permits has become increasingly challenging and time-consuming, delaying mining operations. Furthermore, mining projects in remote areas necessitate substantial infrastructure investment, adding to operational costs. These factors contribute to the overall difficulty in finding, permitting, financing, and operating gold mines. As a result, gold prices have surged in recent months, reaching record highs driven by robust demand, particularly from China. Currently, spot gold is trading at $2,294.3 per ounce.\n\nIn this article we listed 10 companies that were upgraded by analysts and ranked them by the change in their market prices.

        "content": "Deckers (NYSE:DECK) Q1 Earnings: Leading The Footwear Pack\n\nThe end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let\u2019s take a look at how footwear stocks fared in Q1, starting with Deckers (NYSE:DECK).\n\nBefore the advent of the internet, styles changed, but consumers mainly bought shoes by visiting local brick-and-mortar shoe, department, and specialty stores. Today, not only do styles change more frequently as fads travel through social media and the internet but consumers are also shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some footwear companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind.\n\nThe 8 footwear stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 4.1%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line with consensus.

The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, but footwear stocks have shown resilience, with share prices up 8% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nBest Q1: Deckers (NYSE:DECK)\n\nEstablished in 1973, Deckers (NYSE:DECK) is a footwear and apparel conglomerate with a portfolio of lifestyle and performance brands.\n\nDeckers reported revenues of $959.8 million, up 21.2% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 8%.

On the other hand, its full-year EPS forecast was underwhelming.\n\n\"Deckers achieved record results during fiscal year 2024, as we delivered revenue growth of 18% and increased earnings per share by 51%, reflecting a continued dedication to maintain exceptional levels of profitability as our brands scale,\" said Dave Powers, President and Chief Executive Officer.

        "title": "Skechers (SKX) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Skechers (SKX), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Skechers currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if SKX is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this shoe company holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor SKX, shares are up 2.03% over the past week while the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is down 1.4% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.51% compares favorably with the industry's 3.78% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Skechers have increased 19.64% over the past quarter, and have gained 35.45% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.05% and 27.26%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of SKX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, SKX is averaging 1,357,796 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with SKX.\n\nOver the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SKX's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.82 to $4.07 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that SKX is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Skechers on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Shares of Skechers (SKX) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 7.5% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $73.84 in the previous session. Skechers has gained 16.9% since the start of the year compared to the -2% move for the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the -7.7% return for the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 25, 2024, Skechers reported EPS of $1.33 versus consensus estimate of $1.1.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Skechers is expected to post earnings of $4.07 per share on $8.84 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.62% change in EPS on a 10.49% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.61 per share on $9.68 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 13.3% and 9.56%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nSkechers may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nSkechers has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 17X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 15.3X versus its peer group's average of 15.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.27. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Skechers currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Skechers fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Skechers shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Skechers a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Skechers (SKX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SKX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nSkechers' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Skechers' main business drivers.\n\nFounded in 1992 and headquartered in Manhattan Beach, California, Skechers U.S.A., Inc. designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas under the SKECHERS name, as well as under several uniquely branded names.\r\n\r\nThrough its distribution networks, joint venture partners in Asia and the Middle East, and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Japan, throughout Europe and Latin America, Skechers\u2019 products are available in more than 180 countries and territories. As of Mar 31, 2024, SKX had 5,203 stores, including 565 domestic stores, 1,106 international locations, and 3,532 distributors, licensee and franchise stores.\r\n\r\nSkechers offers casuals, dress casuals, comfort and lightweight, sandals, and casual fusion categories for men and women under the Skechers USA brand; sport footwear for men and women, including men\u2019s lifestyle athletic footwear, lightweight women\u2019s sneakers, and sport sandals and boots under the Skechers Sport brand; fusion and sport fusion sneakers for females of all ages under the Skechers Active brand; and vulcanized looks and at Home collection under the brand BOBS from Skechers.\r\n\r\nThe company also provides casuals, field boots, hikers, and athletic shoes for men and women under the Skechers Work brand; boots, shoes, sandals, dress sneakers, and lighted footwear for infants, toddlers, boys, and girls under the Skechers Kids brand; and a vivid range of on-trend casual, dress and active styles for men under Mark Nason Collection.\r\n\r\nThe company also offers specially designed footwear collection under Skechers GOrun, Skechers GOwalk, Skechers, Skechers GOtrain, Skechers GOtrail, Skechers GO Golf and YOU by Skechers.\r\n\r\nSkechers reported segmental results for wholesale (63.1% of first-quarter 2024 total revenues) and direct-to-consumer (36.9% of first-quarter 2024 total revenues) operations, including its joint venture businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Skechers a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in June 2014 would be worth $4,615.82, or a gain of 361.58%, as of June 10, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 gained 174.28% and the price of gold went up 74.31% over the same time frame.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for SKX too.\n\nSkechers strategically broadens its brand range, focusing on comfortable footwear amidst changing lifestyle preferences. Investments in global infrastructure support both online and offline growth, facilitating better customer interaction through seamless experiences. The wholesale segment thrives due to efficient inventory management and expansion into international markets. Strong direct-to-consumer sales reflect successful product innovations and targeted marketing efforts. Skechers plans to further expand its direct sales channels and global presence while investing in new stores. The upwardly revised fiscal 2024 projections following impressive first quarter performance, aligns with Skechers\u2019 strategic goals. Second-quarter sales forecasts reinforce positive momentum. We expect DTC sales to increase 11.8% year over year in 2024.\n\nThe stock is up 7.51% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2024. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Inflation, which resumed its climb in the first quarter of 2024, is finally showing signs of cooling. The Commerce Department said that personal consumption expenditure (PCE), the Federal Reserve\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, increased just 0.3% month over month in April, unchanged from March\u2019s rise and in line with the consensus estimate.\n\nCore PCE, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2% month over month, lower than March\u2019s rise of 0.3% and the consensus estimate of a repeat of 0.3%.\n\nYear over year, PCE increased 2.7%, which was in line with forecasts and the same as March\u2019s increase. Year over year, Core PCE increased 2.8% in April, also in line with the forecast and unchanged March.\n\nThe fresh inflation data comes as personal income and spending slowed in April. Personal income rose 0.3% month over month in April, while consumer spending increased just 0.2%.\n\nAlso, the manufacturing sector slowed further in May. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7% in May from 49.2% in April, indicating that the economy is slowing.\n\nRising inflation in the first quarter faded hopes of a rate cut any time soon as fears of recession grew. However, the signs of a slowing economy and easing inflation have raised hopes once again that the Federal Reserve could soon start rate cuts.\n\nMarket participants are pricing in at least two rate cuts of 25 basis points by the end of this year.

The Comfort Technology Company\u00ae has surpassed $11 million in donations from sales of its BOBS\u00ae from Skechers\u00ae collection\u2014funds that have helped save and support over 2 million animals in need since its start in 2015.\n\nTo commemorate the milestone, the Company has launched a month-long celebration that includes pet adoptions nationwide; grant checks to shelters across the country through its partnership with national non-profit animal-lifesaving organization Petco Love; and the culmination of its Paws for a Cause Design Scholarship, debuting limited-edition styles that were designed by its winning college students.\n\n\"Our $11 million milestone reflects how deeply consumers are engaging with our brand, and how much our impact has grown to help animals in need. The BOBS movement has become an organic, consumer-supported experience shared by pet lovers across North America,\" said Michael Greenberg, president of Skechers.\n\nMr. Greenberg continued: \"We\u2019ve seen so many stories\u2014from the girl who adopted her bulldog and nursed him to health and happiness in Washington to an elementary class that came together to adopt a therapy dog for their school in Michigan\u2014even pilots who have taken to the air to help animals escape natural disasters. Every story has been unique, moving and life-changing for the animal and adopter. Together with the wonderful Paws for a Cause prints that our scholarship winners made in honor of their beloved shelter pets, these experiences unite our pet-loving community in such a beautiful, positive way.\"\n\nPrinted on one of Skechers\u2019 most popular BOBS sneaker silhouettes, the new Paws for a Cause mosaics will debut in mid-June. The designs were created by Cal State Fullerton student Teeny Nadeau in honor of her rescue cat Firefly who recently passed away from cancer, and USC student Maki Shigetani in tribute to her family\u2019s dogs, whose unconditional love has helped support her mental health and brought her joy during the pandemic.\n\nThe Company\u2019s events, in conjunction with partner Petco Love, will include mega-adoptions in Delaware, Florida and Texas; its annual Petco Love register round-up campaign at Skechers stores; a block party and adoption event with Petco Love in New York\u2019s Union Square; and regional pet adoption events and grant presentations in North Carolina, California, and Tennessee, as well as in Canada. BOBS from Skechers will also enter the world of professional sports at the premiere Stanley Pup, featuring NHL hockey teams, athletes and celebrities to generate attention for adoptable pups nationwide, as well as distribute Paws for a Cause scholarships to Nadeau and Shigetani and provide checks to Southern California shelters spcaLA and MeoowzResQ.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Skechers\u2019 contribution will have an enormous impact\u2014helping to employ our staff, provide medical services for our animals and continue our pet adoption efforts,\" said Madeline Bernstein, president of spcaLA. \"We\u2019re deeply grateful for the generosity of Maki and Teeny, who are using their creative talents and love for shelter pets to help animals\u2014as well as companies like Skechers that enable us to connect our adorable adoptables with more pet parents and change their lives forever.\"\n\n\"Congratulations to Skechers on reaching this incredible milestone. Through sales of their BOBS styles, Skechers has donated more than $7.5 million to Petco Love supporting their network of animal welfare organizations,\" added Susanne Kogut, president of Petco Love. \"They\u2019ve been an active, engaged partner at events nationwide and are continually finding new ways to raise awareness and save animals\u2019 lives. They\u2019ve put their heart into this mission for over eight years now, and we\u2019re so proud and appreciative of their support.\"\n\nThrough Skechers\u2019 partnerships with Petco Love and its 4,000+ animal welfare organization network in the United States and Canada, Woodgreen Pets Charity in the UK and ALMA in Japan, BOBS has grown into a cross-continental lifesaving movement\u2014donating funds through purchases of specially marked BOBS from Skechers product, and producing adoption, vaccination and check presentation events for animal welfare organizations.

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Shoes and Retail Apparel stocks have likely encountered both Skechers (SKX) and Birkenstock (BIRK). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nSkechers has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Birkenstock has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that SKX has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nSKX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.35, while BIRK has a forward P/E of 43.22. We also note that SKX has a PEG ratio of 1.23. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. BIRK currently has a PEG ratio of 1.80.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for SKX is its P/B ratio of 2.36. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, BIRK has a P/B of 4.09.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help SKX earn a Value grade of B, while BIRK has been given a Value grade of F.\n\nSKX stands above BIRK thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that SKX is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Is Steven Madden (SHOO) Up 9.9% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Steven Madden (SHOO). Shares have added about 9.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Steven Madden due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nSteven Madden Q1 Earnings Beat, Revenues Increase Y/Y\n\nSteven Madden better-than-expected results in first-quarter 2024, with the top and bottom lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, revenues and earnings increased year over year.\r\n\r\nThe company made significant strides in key strategic areas, achieving double-digit revenue growth in the international markets, non-footwear categories, and direct-to-consumer channels, along with a revenue revival in the U.S. wholesale footwear business. The ongoing strategic efforts are expected to help sustain revenue and earnings growth, thereby generating substantial value for stakeholders over the long term.\n\nQ1 Highlights\n\nSteven Madden posted adjusted quarterly earnings of 65 cents a share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. The same increased 30% from 50 cents in the prior-year period.\r\n\r\nTotal revenues rose 19.1% year over year to $552.4 million. Net revenues of $550.6 million went up 19.2%, and commission and licensing fee income of $1.8 million decreased 13.5% from the year-ago period. The top line beat the consensus estimate of $522 million.\r\n\r\nAdjusted gross profit rose 15.3% year over year to $225 million. We note that the adjusted gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 40.7%.\r\n\r\nGross profit, as a percentage of wholesale revenues, decreased 190 bps to 35.1%, driven by the effects of Almost Famous and a shift in the wholesale footwear mix toward the private label business. However, gross profit, as a percentage of direct-to-consumer revenues, increased 270 bps to 61.9% due to reduced promotional activity.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s adjusted operating expenses increased 11.3% year over year to $164.1 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating expenses declined 210 bps year over year to 29.7%.\r\n\r\nSteven Madden reported an adjusted operating income of $61 million, up 27.8% from the same quarter a year ago. The adjusted operating margin increased 80 bps to 11%.\n\nSegmental Performance\n\nRevenues for the Wholesale business improved 21% year over year to $438.2 million. We note that Wholesale footwear revenues increased 4.7% year over year, while Wholesale accessories/apparel revenues grew 78.6%. Excluding the recent acquisition of Almost Famous, wholesale revenues rose 9.7% year over year, and wholesale accessories and apparel revenues grew 27.4%.\r\n\r\nDTC revenues increased 12.8% to $112.3 million, driven by an increase in the brick-and-mortar and e-commerce businesses.\r\n\r\nSHOO ended the first quarter with 253 brick-and-mortar retail outlets, five e-commerce websites and 25 company-operated concessions across the international markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Financial Aspects\n\nSteven Madden ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $131.5 million, short-term investments of $11.6 million, and stockholders\u2019 equity of $825.2 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $18.4 million. Management incurred a capital expenditure of $4 million in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the reported quarter, SHOO repurchased $37.3 million of its common stock, including shares acquired via the net settlement of employees\u2019 stock awards. At the end of the first quarter, there was approximately $143 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization. Moreover, management approved a quarterly cash dividend of 21 cents per share, payable Jun 21, 2024, to stockholders of record as of Jun 10.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, the company anticipates an 11-13% increase in revenues from that reported in 2023, with adjusted earnings of $2.55-$2.65 per share. Notably, the company reported earnings of $2.30 per share in 2023.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates review flatlined during the past month.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Steven Madden has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nSteven Madden has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nSteven Madden belongs to the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry. Another stock from the same industry, Skechers (SKX), has gained 6.6% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nSkechers reported revenues of $2.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.33 for the same period compares with $1.02 a year ago.\n\nFor the current quarter, Skechers is expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share, indicating a change of -7.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Skechers. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of C.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Today, not only do styles change more frequently as fads travel through social media and the internet but consumers are also shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some footwear companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind.\n\nThe 6 footwear stocks we track reported a solid Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 5.1%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line with consensus. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, but footwear stocks have exhibited impressive performance, with the share prices up 13.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nSkechers (NYSE:SKX)\n\nSynonymous with \"dad shoe\", Skechers (NYSE:SKX) is a footwear company renowned for its comfortable, stylish, and affordable shoes for all ages.\n\nSkechers reported revenues of $2.25 billion, up 12.5% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 2.3%.

It was a decent quarter for the company:\u00a0Nike blew past analysts' EPS expectations. Its revenue and gross margin narrowly outperformed Wall Street's estimates, driven by strong sales of its Nike-branded goods (this excludes Converse, whose revenue dropped 20% on a constant currency basis).\n\nNike had the weakest performance against analyst estimates among its peers.

Today, we are looking at footwear stocks, starting with Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX).\n\nBefore the advent of the internet, styles changed, but consumers mainly bought shoes by visiting local brick-and-mortar shoe, department, and specialty stores. Today, not only do styles change more frequently as fads travel through social media and the internet but consumers are also shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some footwear companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind.\n\nThe 6 footwear stocks we track reported a solid Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 5.1%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line with consensus. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility.

        "title": "Is Skechers (SKX) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Skechers (SKX) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nSkechers currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 10 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 10 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 70% and 10% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SKX Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for SKX\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Skechers here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Skechers, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in SKX?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Skechers, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 6.4% over the past month to $4.06.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Skechers. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Skechers may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Tapestry's (TPR) Strategic Expansion &amp; Innovation Bode Well",
        "content": "Tapestry, Inc.\u2019s TPR proactive approach to expanding its luxury brand portfolio and enhancing its operational capabilities underpins its robust position in the global luxury market. The company's strategic initiatives, from digital transformation to regional market adaptations, are designed to align with evolving consumer preferences and emerging market dynamics.\r\n\r\nThrough disciplined financial management and a forward-thinking growth strategy, Tapestry is well-prepared to navigate the challenges of a competitive landscape. With a focus on customer-centricity and a commitment to leveraging digital platforms, Tapestry is set to drive continuous growth, improve shareholder value and maintain its reputation as a leader in the luxury retail sector.\r\n\r\nDriven by these factors, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s shares have risen 39.3% compared with the industry\u2019s 20.5% growth over the past six months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s Dig Deeper\n\nIn response to the evolving retail landscape, Tapestry continues to enhance its digital and omnichannel strategies. The company has launched online platforms, such as katespadeoutlet.com, to offer a more seamless shopping experience. With a strong emphasis on a data-driven approach, TPR's digital business accounted for more than 25% of its total revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nTapestry's international strategy has been fruitful, particularly in key markets like Asia and Europe. The company's focus on tailoring products and marketing strategies to local tastes has helped drive significant growth. Notably, revenues in Europe grew 19% year over year, whereas other Asia markets, excluding China and Japan, saw a 15% increase in the fiscal third quarter. This targeted approach has solidified Tapestry's presence and appeal across diverse global markets.\r\n\r\nCentral to TPR's strategy is a strong focus on customer centricity, which has been crucial in engaging and growing its customer base, particularly among younger demographics, such as Gen Z and Millennials. In North America alone, Tapestry attracted 1.2 million customers in the fiscal third quarter, with a significant portion coming from these younger groups. This focus on consumer preferences and behaviors is expected to continue driving TPR\u2019s growth and market relevance.\r\n\r\nTapestry's acquisition of Capri Holdings is set to significantly enhance its value and financial performance. This transformative move will create a global luxury and fashion powerhouse, expanding TPR's portfolio across consumer segments and geographies.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Outlook\n\nTapestry's financial forecast for fiscal 2024 demonstrates a strong commitment to maintaining brand integrity, enhancing operational efficiencies, and exercising financial caution amid a difficult market landscape. The company anticipates achieving more than $6.6 billion in revenues, maintaining a stable performance than the previous year and expecting modest 1% growth on a constant-currency basis.\r\n\r\nRegionally, revenue growth predictions vary from a low-single-digit increase in Greater China to a mid-single-digit rise in Japan, and more significant low-double-digit growth in other Asian regions and Europe.\r\n\r\nThe gross margin is projected to improve 230 basis points, supported by decreasing freight costs that contribute approximately 130 basis points to this improvement. Furthermore, an expansion of 110 basis points in the operating margin is expected. Earnings per share for the year are estimated between $4.20 and $4.25, suggesting an 8-9% increase from the previous year\u2019s actual.\n\nChallenges Across Tapestry's Portfolio\n\nKate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, two prominent brands within Tapestry\u2019s portfolio, are encountering significant challenges. Kate Spade has experienced a notable decline in sales, with revenues falling 5.6% in the fiscal third quarter, underscoring the brand's difficulties in maintaining market relevance and attracting consumer interest in a competitive fashion landscape. Despite efforts to manage costs, the persistent decline raises concerns about its long-term growth and profitability.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Stuart Weitzman's recovery appears sluggish, with a 17.9% drop in revenues in the third quarter. This is partly due to strategic reductions in off-price wholesale shipments, highlighting the struggles faced by the brand in adapting to changing consumer preferences and intense competition in the luxury footwear market.\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks are Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX, The Gap, Inc. GPS and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF.\r\n\r\nSkechers designs, develops, markets and distributes footwear for men, women and children.

        "title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Skechers Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Skechers (SKX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SKX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nSkechers' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Skechers' main business drivers.\n\nFounded in 1992 and headquartered in Manhattan Beach, California, Skechers U.S.A., Inc. designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas under the SKECHERS name, as well as under several uniquely branded names.\r\n\r\nThrough its distribution networks, joint venture partners in Asia and the Middle East, and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Japan, throughout Europe and Latin America, Skechers\u2019 products are available in more than 180 countries and territories. As of Mar 31, 2024, SKX had 5,203 stores, including 565 domestic stores, 1,106 international locations, and 3,532 distributors, licensee and franchise stores.\r\n\r\nSkechers offers casuals, dress casuals, comfort and lightweight, sandals, and casual fusion categories for men and women under the Skechers USA brand; sport footwear for men and women, including men\u2019s lifestyle athletic footwear, lightweight women\u2019s sneakers, and sport sandals and boots under the Skechers Sport brand; fusion and sport fusion sneakers for females of all ages under the Skechers Active brand; and vulcanized looks and at Home collection under the brand BOBS from Skechers.\r\n\r\nThe company also provides casuals, field boots, hikers, and athletic shoes for men and women under the Skechers Work brand; boots, shoes, sandals, dress sneakers, and lighted footwear for infants, toddlers, boys, and girls under the Skechers Kids brand; and a vivid range of on-trend casual, dress and active styles for men under Mark Nason Collection.\r\n\r\nThe company also offers specially designed footwear collection under Skechers GOrun, Skechers GOwalk, Skechers, Skechers GOtrain, Skechers GOtrail, Skechers GO Golf and YOU by Skechers.\r\n\r\nSkechers reported segmental results for wholesale (63.1% of first-quarter 2024 total revenues) and direct-to-consumer (36.9% of first-quarter 2024 total revenues) operations, including its joint venture businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Skechers, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $5,013.56, or a gain of 401.36%, as of May 20, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 182.41% and gold's return of 79.53% over the same time frame.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for SKX too.\n\nSkechers strategically broadens its brand range, focusing on comfortable footwear amidst changing lifestyle preferences. Investments in global infrastructure support both online and offline growth, facilitating better customer interaction through seamless experiences. The wholesale segment thrives due to efficient inventory management and expansion into international markets. Strong direct-to-consumer sales reflect successful product innovations and targeted marketing efforts. Skechers plans to further expand its direct sales channels and global presence while investing in new stores. The upwardly revised fiscal 2024 projections following impressive first quarter performance, aligns with Skechers\u2019 strategic goals. Second-quarter sales forecasts reinforce positive momentum. Management is poised to attain $10 billion in sales by 2026.\n\nShares have gained 21.29% over the past four weeks and there have been 7 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Under Armour (UAA) Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Fall Y/Y",
        "content": "Under Armour, Inc. UAA has reported mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both metrics dropped year over year.\n\nRevenue & Earnings Picture\n\nThe Baltimore-based company reported adjusted earnings of 11 cents a share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents. However, the figure decreased from adjusted earnings of 18 cents a share in the year-ago period.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, net revenues of $1,332.2 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,323 million. This metric declined 4.7% on a year-over-year basis and 5% on a currency-neutral basis.\r\n\r\nWholesale revenues declined 6.5% to $849.8 million, while direct-to-consumer revenues increased 0.2% to $454.7 million. Revenues from owned and operated stores rose 7%, and eCommerce revenues dropped 8%, accounting for 43% of the total direct-to-consumer revenues for the quarter.\n\nUnder Armour, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nUnder Armour, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Under Armour, Inc. Quote\n\nLet\u2019s Delve Deeper\n\nBy product category, Apparel revenues edged down 1.3% year over year to $877.3 million, whereas Footwear revenues decreased 10.6% to $337.7 million. Revenues from the Accessories category fell 6.6% to $89.4 million. Meanwhile, Licensing revenues increased 10.5% to $28.5 million.\r\n\r\nNet revenues from North America declined 10.4% year over year to $771.9 million. Meanwhile, revenues from the international business increased 6.6% (up 6% on a currency-neutral basis) to $561.1 million.\r\n\r\nWithin the international business, net revenues from the EMEA jumped 9.5% year over year to $284.1 million. Revenues from the Asia-Pacific rose 0.8% to $226.7 million and that from the Latin American region grew 20.2% to $50.2 million.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s gross margin expanded 170 basis points to 45% from the prior-year period, largely propelled by supply-chain efficiencies resulting in reduced freight costs. However, this gain was partly offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts and proactive inventory management actions, including increased promotional activities in the direct-to-consumer business segment.\r\n\r\nAdjusted SG&A expenses declined 5% year over year to $545.7 million. Adjusted operating income came in at $53.9 million in the quarter under review. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Financial Details\n\nUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $858.7 million, a long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $594.9 million, and total stockholders' equity of $2,153.3 million. For fiscal 2025, management expects capital expenditure between $200 million and $220 million.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, the company approved the buyback of up to $500 million of its outstanding Class C common stock. The repurchases may be conducted over the next three years using various methods, such as accelerated share repurchase, open market purchases or private negotiations.\n\nStory continues\n\nFY25 Outlook\n\nFor fiscal 2025, Under Armour expects revenues to decrease in a low-double-digit percentage rate. This forecast includes a 15-17% decline in North America as the company aims to significantly restructure this segment after years of extensive promotional activities, especially in its direct-to-consumer sector. Additionally, a low-single-digit percentage decrease is anticipated in international revenues due to conservative consumer trends and efforts to maintain brand strength.\r\n\r\nThe gross margin is projected to increase 75-100 basis points, influenced by a substantial reduction in promotional and discount activities in the DTC business, and benefits from product costing.\r\n\r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are anticipated to decrease 2-4%. Operating income is expected between $50-$70 million. Excluding expected restructuring charges, the adjusted operating income is projected to be $130-$150 million. Adjusted earnings per share are estimated between 18 cents and 21 cents.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 7.4% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s fall of 1.9%.\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are The Gap, Inc. GPS, Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF.\r\n\r\nThe Gap is a premier international specialty retailer offering a diverse range of clothing, accessories and personal care products. It sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPS\u2019s current fiscal-year earnings and sales indicates declines of 0.3% and 4.9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.

        "content": "Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. BOOT came up with fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein both revenues and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the top and bottom lines declined year over year. The company faced soft same-store sales, e-commerce hurdles and a tough operational landscape in the reported quarteer.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the company emphasizes operational efficiency and cost management, focusing on optimizing supply-chain operations and maintaining careful inventory management to align with fluctuating sales trends and consumer demands. The expansion of its retail footprint remains central to its growth strategy, with a targeted approach to opening new stores in strategic markets. It opened 55 new stores in fiscal 2024, exceeding original plans.\n\nBoot Barn Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nBoot Barn Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. Quote\n\nQ4 in Detail\n\nBoot Barn\u2019s adjusted earnings of $1.01 per share declined 34% from $1.53 reported in the year-ago quarter. Yet, the metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents.\r\n\r\nSales of $388.5 million tumbled 8.7% year over year. However, this metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $384 million. The reduction in net sales stemmed from a dip in consolidated same store sales and the effect of having a 13-week quarter compared with a 14-week quarter in the previous year. This was somewhat mitigated by the additional sales from new stores opened in the past twelve months.\r\n\r\nSame-store sales declined 5.9% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. Retail store same-store sales and e-commerce same-store sales fell 5.7% and 7.6%, respectively.\r\n\r\nGross profit decreased 10.5% to $139.4 million. Gross profit fell mainly due to a decline in sales partially mitigated by an expansion in merchandise margins.\r\n\r\nGross margin contracted 70 basis points (bps) to 35.9% due to a 230 bps increase in expenses related to buying, occupancy and distribution center costs. This was partially compensated by a 160 bps improvement in the merchandise margin. The rise in merchandise margin was fueled by a 160 bps enhancement in freight expense and supply-chain efficiencies relative to net sales.\r\n\r\nThe increase in buying, occupancy and distribution center costs was primarily due to higher occupancy expenses from new stores and depreciation expenses associated with the opening of the new Kansas City distribution center.\r\n\r\nSG&A expenses increased to $101.2 million in the reported quarter, up 8.7% year over year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense of 26.1% rose 420 bps year over year. The increase reflected higher marketing expenses, normalized incentive-based compensation compared with a reversal in the prior period, a $2.0 million partial impairment of the Sheplers\u2019 trademark, elevated store labor costs and the effect of a 13-week quarter relative to a 14-week quarter in the previous year.\r\n\r\nOperating income decreased 39% to $38.2 million. The operating margin of 9.8% contracted 490 bps from 14.7% last year.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Financial Details\n\nBOOT ended the quarter with $75.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Notably, the company did not draw any funds from its $250 million revolving credit facility during the quarter. Average inventory per store increased approximately 1% on a same-store basis compared with Apr 1, 2023.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Boot Barn estimates net sales in the $399-$407 million band, indicating growth of 4-6.1% from the year-ago levels.\r\n\r\nThe company expects same-store sales to decline in the range of 2.5-4.5%. Retail store same-store sales are forecast to decrease in the 3-5% band and e-commerce same-store sales are likely to be flat to up 2%. Operating income is estimated to be between $38.7 million and $41.2 million, implying to represent about 9.7-10.1% of sales. Earnings are projected in the range of 94 cents-$1.00 per share.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2025, management expects to open 60 stores. It now foresees total revenues to be between $1.766 billion and $1.800 billion, indicating growth of 5.9-8% from the year-ago levels.\r\n\r\nBOOT suggests same-store sales to decline in the band of 1.6-3.6%. Retail store same-store sales are anticipated to dip 2-4% and e-commerce same-store sales to inch down 0.5% to up 2%.\r\n\r\nGross profit is envisioned to be between $647.2 million and $664.1 million, suggesting to represent approximately 36.6-36.9% of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be between $458.9 million and $463.4 million. The metric is likely to be about 26-25.7% of sales.\r\n\r\nIncome from operations is projected to be between $188.3 million and $200.7 million, or about 10.7-11.2% of sales. The effective tax rate is estimated to be 26.2%. Earnings are projected in the range of $4.55-$4.85 per share.\r\n\r\nCapital expenditures are forecast to be between $115 million and $120 million, which is net of estimated landlord tenant allowances of $30.2 million.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 18.1% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 3.4% in past three months.\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are The Gap, Inc.

        "content": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX is riding high as its shoes are on trend worldwide. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expecting sales to hit a new record high for the year in 2024.\r\n\r\nSkechers makes a diverse range of lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. It sells its collections in 180 countries through department and specialty stores and direct-to-consumers through Skechers e-commerce sites and about 5,200 company- and third party owned- physical retail stores.\r\n\r\nAlthough headquartered in Southern California, it's a truly global company, with more than half of its total sales from the international business.\r\n\r\nA Record First Quarter\r\n\r\nOn Apr 25, 2024, Skechers reported its first quarter results and beat on the Zacks Consensus by $0.23. Earnings were $1.33 versus the consensus of $1.10.\r\n\r\nIt was the 6th consecutive earnings beat in a row.\r\n\r\nSales jumped 12.5% to a record $2.3 billion from $2 billion a year ago. Direct-to-consumer was up 17% while wholesale rose 10%.\r\n\r\nInternational sales rose 15% while US domestic gained 8%. For the quarter, international sales represented 65% of total sales. All geographic regions were higher with growth rising 17% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 16% in Asia Pacific and 8% in the Americas.\r\n\r\nDomestic wholesale, which had lagged in the fourth quarter, returned to growth, rising 8% year-over-year.\r\n\r\nIt's celebrity branding is driving sales including signature capsules with Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg. The comfort technology is also a catalyst as its Skechers Hands Free Slip-ins footwear has become the number one Skechers comfort technology product in most markets.\r\n\r\nGross margin increased 360 basis points to 52.5%, primarily due to lower costs per unit, driven by lower freight costs and higher average selling prices.\r\n\r\nInventory fell 10.8% to $1.36 billion, a decline of $164.8 million, from Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nRaised Full Year Guidance\r\n\r\nAfter such a strong first quarter, it's not surprising that Skechers raised its full year earnings and sales guidance.\r\n\r\nFor earnings, it raised the earnings to between $3.95 and $4.10 per share, that's up from the guidance it gave in Feb 2024 which was a range of $3.65 to $3.85.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the analysts raised their estimates for 2024. 6 estimates have been revised higher over the last month, pushing the Zacks Consensus up to $4.02.\r\n\r\nThat's earnings growth of 15.2% as the company made $3.49 last year.\r\n\r\nThe analysts are bullish about the momentum sticking around too as 6 estimates were also revised higher for 2025 at the same time. The Zacks Consensus has jumped 13% to $4.55.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares at New All-Time Highs\r\n\r\nShares of Skechers jumped after this latest earnings beat and continue to hit new all-time highs. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSkechers is still attractively valued, with a forward P/E of just 16.9.\r\n\r\nIt's also shareholder friendly. The company repurchased 1 million shares, for $60 million in the first quarter. As of Mar 31, 2024, it had $205.7 million remaining under the share repurchase program.\r\n\r\nFor investors looking for a retailer with sales momentum, Skechers should be on your short list.\r\n\r\n[In full disclosure, Zacks Insider Trader currently owns shares of Skechers in its portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs SKX a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Skechers, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 6.3% over the past month to $4.02.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Skechers. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Skechers may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Hanesbrands (HBI) Q1 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Sales Down",
        "content": "Hanesbrands Inc. HBI reported mixed first-quarter 2024 results, with the top line declining year over year and missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure and surpassed the consensus mark. Management reaffirmed its 2024 guidance.\n\nQ1 in Detail\n\nThe company posted an adjusted loss from continuing operations of 2 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which was pegged at a loss of 6 cents. The metric improved from a loss of 6 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nNet sales from continuing operations declined 16.8% to $1,156.2 million and came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,173.1 million. The metric includes nearly 120 basis points (bps) impact from the U.S. Hosiery divestiture and almost 105 bps from unfavorable currency rates. On a constant-currency basis, organic net sales fell nearly 15%. The downside was caused by headwinds in the Activewear segment.\r\n\r\nGlobal Champion brand sales tumbled 26%, with a decline of 35% in the United States and 17% internationally. Global Champion brand sales fell 25% at constant currency (cc). International brand sales declined 16% at cc compared with the prior-year quarter\u2019s tally.\n\nHanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nHanesbrands Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Hanesbrands Inc. Quote\n\nAdjusted gross profit came in at $461 million, up 2% year over year. We had expected the metric to come in at $408.3 million. The adjusted gross margin was 39.9%, up nearly 720 basis points (bps), exceeding our anticipation of 34.8%. The upside was driven by reduced input costs stemming from moderate commodity and ocean freight inflation. Gains from cost savings initiatives and the impact of the business mix also contributed to the upside.\n\nAdjusted SG&A expenses declined 3% to $378 million on cost savings initiatives, disciplined expense management and reduced distribution expenses. The metric, as a percentage of net sales, increased 450 bps year over year to 32.7% due to deleveraging from reduced sales and increased brand marketing investments.\r\n\r\nAdjusted operating profit came in at $84 million, up 32% year over year. Adjusted operating margin stood at 7.3%, up nearly 270 bps. We had expected adjusted operating profit and margin to be $71.5 million and 6.1%, respectively.\n\nSegmental Details\n\nInnerwear: The segment\u2019s sales fell 8.4% year over year to $506.8 million. The downside can be attributed to the more-than-anticipated level of inventory management actions undertaken by some retailers. Despite a soft market trend, the company's focus on consumer-centric strategy is paying off, helping it gain market share and outperform peers. The segmental operating margin was 21.9%, up almost 880 bps.\r\n\r\nActivewear: Sales plunged 30.9% to $217.7 million. The downside was due to factors like transitioning the Champion kids\u2019 business to a license model from 2024 onward. Also, very strong collegiate sales performance, along with accelerated orders before the SAP implementation during the first quarter of 2023, was a hurdle. Apart from these, the ongoing challenges in the activewear apparel market due to subdued consumer demand and cautious retailer orders contributed to the downside. The segmental operating margin was 0.5%, down nearly 265 bps year over year.\r\n\r\nInternational: Revenues in the International business declined 12.3% year over year to $406 million. This included nearly $15 million of unfavorable currency headwinds. We note that Latin America, Japan and China experienced growth at cc. However, the upside was offset by declines in Europe and Australia due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges affecting demand in these regions. The segmental operating margin stood at 12.3%, up nearly 120 bps.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Financial Details\n\nThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $191.2 million, long-term debt of $3,237.4 million and total stockholders\u2019 equity of $338.2 million. It had more than $1 billion of available capacity under its credit facility at the end of the quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter, the company registered $26 million in net cash from operating activities. Free cash flow was $5 million in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor 2024, net sales from continuing operations are anticipated to be $5.35-$5.47 billion, including anticipated headwinds of almost $50 million from the U.S. Hosiery divestiture and a currency headwind of nearly $45 million. The midpoint of the guidance suggests an almost 4% year-over-year decline on a reported basis and an approximately 2% decline on an organic basis at cc.\r\n\r\nAdjusted operating profit from continuing operations is likely to be $500-$520 million, including a currency headwind expectation of roughly $9 million.\r\n\r\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations is envisioned to be 42-48 cents. Cash flow from operations is forecast to be nearly $400 million, while capital investments are estimated to be almost $75 million.\r\n\r\nFor second-quarter 2024, net sales from continuing operations are expected to be $1.335-$1.375 billion, including a projected headwind of nearly $25 million from currency rates. The midpoint of the guidance suggests a nearly 6% year-over-year decline on a reported basis and an approximately 3% decline on an organic basis at cc. Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations is expected to be $115-$130 million. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations are envisioned to be 7-11 cents per share.\r\n\r\nHBI\u2019s shares have declined 8.2% in the past three months against the industry\u2019s 3.1% growth.\n\nTop 3 Picks\n\nSkechers SKX, which designs, develops, markets and distributes footwear for men, women and children in the United States and overseas, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

GIL, a distributor and manufacturer of activewear products, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). GIL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.6%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gildan Activewear's current fiscal-year earnings and sales suggests an improvement of 14.4% and 2.1%, respectively, from the year-earlier levels.\r\n\r\nKontoor Brands KTB, an apparel company, carries a Zacks Rank of 2 at present. KTB has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for KTB\u2019s current fiscal-year earnings and sales suggests an improvement of 11% and 0.1%, respectively, from the year-earlier levels.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals.\n\nWhile you may have an investing style you rely on, finding great stocks is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores. These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nDifferent than value or growth investors, momentum-oriented investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\n\nSkechers (SKX)\n\nFounded in 1992 and headquartered in Manhattan Beach, California, Skechers U.S.A., Inc. designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas under the SKECHERS name, as well as under several uniquely branded names.\n\nSKX boasts a Momentum Style Score of B and VGM Score of A, and holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.

        "title": "Buy in May and Stay? The Top 7 Stocks to Buy This Month",
        "content": "\u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d is a very popular slogan this time of year. And I would admit it applies to many investors right now. Why wouldn\u2019t it? The stock market just had one of the best rallies we\u2019ve seen, which is cooling down now. That is along with bad macroeconomic reports spelling trouble for the economy.\n\nGDP growth came in low at 1.6% vs 2.2% expected, and inflation came in slightly hotter. If you put all these things together, it might look like the perfect time to shift your gains away from growth and into defense right now. I do not think that is a bad idea, but I would also argue there are still opportunities in the market that could deliver good gains in May and beyond. That said, since we are just talking about May, my focus will be on stocks with a bit more of a near-term lens.\n\nThe market is still holding strong right now, and the old Wall Street adage of \u201cmaking hay while the sun shines\u201d seems apt here. Let\u2019s take a look at the following seven top stocks to buy in May that have the potential to shine.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPerdoceo Education (PRDO) text books on a desk with a chalkboard in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPerdoceo Education (NASDAQ:PRDO) is pretty self-explanatory in what it does \u2014 it provides post-secondary education, whether online or campus-based. It is a pretty niche business since there are not many public companies directly involved in education. Plus, this isn\u2019t the best environment for a teacher or a company to be involved in teaching due to the hostile regulatory environment and challenges inside classrooms these days. That said, the fundamentals here are very attractive. Perdoceo is building corporate partnerships and offering many types of specialized courses supported by artificial intelligence and machine learning. While the near-term growth isn\u2019t very flashy right now, I believe international students would drive a lot of growth in the years ahead, as they usually pay full price and aren\u2019t subject to regular government intervention regarding student debt.\n\nDespite the mid-single-digit EPS growth, the cash pile has been growing and currently stands at $642 million against just $23 million of debt. It also has a 1.84% dividend yield, and the stock recently broke out to nearly $24 due to revenue and EPS beating estimates by 13% and 3%, respectively. The stock is up 100% in the past year. In my view, Perdoceo\u2019s solid financials and growth prospects make it an attractive pick for May.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is one of the most well-rounded stocks in the market right now. I would argue that it is by far the best EV stock you can buy despite some near-term weakness here. Li Auto is the only startup with this much growth and has maintained positive margins with very little dilution. Every other EV startup you look at will likely have negative margins, very slow growth or some big red flag attached to it. This company does not face those problems, and despite a small slump in delivery guidance, I think it is well on its way to outperforming in May.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue was up 136.4% in Q4 2023, along\u00a0with a gross margin of 13.6%. It even outsold Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) in many parts of China.\u00a0Analysts expect continuing growth, with EPS rising from $1.8 to $3.2 from 2024 to 2026, along with\u00a053% revenue growth for all of 2024.\u00a0You\u2019re paying just 20 times forward earnings and 1.1 times forward sales for all this growth. The growth runway is also massive, as it is an EV company.\u00a0To me,\u00a0Li Auto\u2019s stellar financials and growth prospects make it a compelling buy this month.\n\nBlue Bird (BLBD)\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/kali9\n\nBlue Bird (NASDAQ:BLBD) is\u00a0mostly\u00a0known for its school buses. This American company has also seen very flashy growth similar to Li Auto, though it\u00a0is expected\u00a0to moderate much faster. However, I believe it deserves a much higher premium as a domestic company. It dominates the school bus industry with a 30% market share, and this company could receive a lot of subsidies\u00a0going forward\u00a0as it switches to electric buses.\n\nBlue Bird has a massive backlog of over 5,000 units. It sold 206 electric buses in Q1,\u00a0up 124% year-over-year (YoY). Fulfilling all that backlog would lead to a lot of growth in the years ahead, and we are already seeing that growth kick in. The stock is up 91% in the past year, with revenue up 35% YOY. It\u00a0is also scheduled\u00a0to report its results on May 8th, which should be live by the time you read this article. As I noted in an article\u00a0back\u00a0in October 2022, BLBD will be a significant beneficiary of federal grants, and the stock has been up around 310% since then.\u00a0I think it\u00a0can still deliver triple-digit returns from current valuations if it keeps beating expectations.\n\nFortuna Silver Mines (FSM) Macro of silver\n\nSource: Phawat / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortuna Silver Mines (NYSE:FSM) is a Canadian silver mining company with\u00a0operations spread worldwide\u00a0in Argentina, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mexico, Peru and Senegal.\u00a0Moreover, this company mines gold, lead\u00a0and\u00a0zinc,\u00a0along with\u00a0silver.\u00a0The company has seen excellent growth in the past few years, even though the stock has seen\u00a0lots of\u00a0ups and downs.\n\nIt recently reported blowout Q1 earnings, with net income coming in at $26.7 million vs. $20.6 million in the previous quarter. FSM also generated $84.3 million in cash flow from operations, and the S\u00e9gu\u00e9la mine achieved higher-than-design mill throughput, while\u00a0the San Jose mine focused on exploration at the high-grade Yessi vein. The company also did a\u00a0small\u00a0$3.5 million buyback program.\u00a0In my view, these positive developments make\u00a0the future outlook for Fortuna Silver Mines very bullish indeed.\u00a0The stock is up 28% year-to-date, but I believe it can gain\u00a0a lot\u00a0more ground from here if gold and silver prices continue their upward trajectory.\n\nJamf Holding (JAMF) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nJamf Holding (NASDAQ:JAMF) is a software company\u00a0that specializes\u00a0in Apple Enterprise Management, providing a complete management and security solution for an Apple-first environment.\u00a0It is a profitable software company\u00a0still growing its top line at double digits, yet\u00a0I don\u2019t think\u00a0it should be trading at such low valuations.\n\nThe demand for Jamf\u2019s products has remained healthy, with revenue growing consistently in a linear fashion. Analysts expect EPS to grow 76% in 2024 and 53% in 2025. Moreover, management\u2019s guidance seems conservative considering past performance, so future beats could deliver significant gains. Given its strong growth prospects, Jamf appears undervalued at current levels.\n\nSkechers (SKX) sketchers show store. sleeper stocks\n\nSource: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkechers (NYSE:SKX) is a company similar to Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) in that it is a footwear company that has\u00a0been seeing\u00a0lots of growth in recent quarters.\u00a0The stock is up 27% over the past year, and we are looking at\u00a0EPS growth continuing going forward.\n\nAnalysts expect EPS to grow from $4.2 in 2024 to $7.3 in\u00a02028,\u00a0along with\u00a0low double-digit revenue growth.\u00a0The 3-year EPS growth rate (minus non-recurring items) has been stellar at 74%, better than 90% of its peers.\u00a0Of course, this company is not like Crocs\u00a0and\u00a0makes shoes instead of clogs, but it is still popular and is seeing lots of growth.\u00a0In my estimation,\u00a0Skechers could be a solid footwear pick for May.\n\nEZCorp (EZPW) Man buying gold jewellry, pawn shop and us dollar banknotes\n\nSource: Miriam Doerr Martin Frommherz via Shutterstock\n\nEZCorp (NASDAQ:EZPW) stock has a long history of ups and downs and seems to be enjoying a few years of stability post-COVID. Pawn shops have long been considered a thing of the past, but this company seems to be proving otherwise. It operates pawn shops in the U.S. and Latin America, and the company has been surprisingly profitable so far.\n\nIts 3-year EPS growth rate\u00a0sits at\u00a055%, better than 87% of its peers.\u00a0While it is\u00a0a bit\u00a0expensive\u00a0right now, I expect growth to catch up to the valuation in the coming years.\u00a0The stock is up 13% in the past year. Given its solid financials and growth prospects, EZCorp could be an intriguing under-the-radar pick this month.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "5 Growth Stocks to Buy for Steady Returns in May",
        "content": "April is known for being favorable to Wall Street investors. But this year, April ended on a disappointing note. A sticky inflation rate, a resilient labor market and a significant decline in the U.S. GDP growth rate dented market participants\u2019 confidence in risky assets like equities.\n\nHowever, U.S. stock markets rebounded in early May as recently released economic data boosted market participants\u2019 confidence in equities. A sharp decline in April job additions, a notable deterioration of the U.S. GDP growth rate in first-quarter 2024, the contraction of manufacturing and services PMI in April and a less-than-hawkish statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell after the May FOMC meeting raised expectations for an interest rate cut.\n\nPositive Catalysts\n\nFollowing the release of April\u2019s nonfarm payrolls, the CME FedWatch shows a 67.4% probability that the central bank will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in the September FOMC meeting. The interest rate futures tool also shows a massive 91.5% probability that the Fed will cut the rate by 50 basis points.\n\nFurthermore, first-quarter 2024 earnings results have been better than expected so far. As of May 7, 426 companies on the S&P 500 Index reported their financial numbers. Total earnings of these index members are up 5.2% from the same period last year on 4.1% higher revenues, with 78.2% beating EPS estimates and 61% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAt present, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index in first-quarter 2024 are expected to be up 4.8% on 4.2% higher revenues. This follows the 6.8% earnings growth on 4% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% earnings growth on 2.2% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five growth stocks that have solid upside left for 2024. These stocks have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Growth Score A. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.

        "content": "The Aaron's Company, Inc. AAN reported a wider-than-expected loss per share in the first quarter of 2024. Also, its revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year.\r\n\r\nAaron's delivered an adjusted loss of 15 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 8 cents. The company\u2019s bottom line compared unfavorably with adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The soft bottom-line performance can be attributed to the decline in revenues, and higher other operating expenses and write-offs. This was partly negated by reduced personnel costs.\r\n\r\nConsolidated revenues declined 7.7% to $511.5 million, driven by soft lease revenues and fees at the Aaron's business, and a dip in retail sales at the BrandsMart business. The figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $517 million.\r\n\r\nWe note that shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have declined 32.8% in the past three months against the industry\u2019s 1.5% growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBreaking up the components of consolidated revenues, lease revenues and fees dropped 7.4% year over year to $346 million, and retail sales decreased 9% to $136.9 million. Non-retail sales, which mainly include merchandise sales to franchisees, declined 5.4% year over year to $22.6 million, while franchise royalties and other revenues decreased 2.8% to $5.9 million from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the Aaron\u2019s business segment, revenues declined 7.5% year over year to $381.1 million due to a 4.8% dip in the lease portfolio size at the end of the quarter and a reduction of 110 basis points (bps) in the lease renewal rate to 87.4%. The company noted that lease portfolio size gradually improved in the quarter, driven by growth in lease merchandise deliveries. At the beginning of the first quarter, the lease portfolio size was down 7% year over year.\r\n\r\nSame-store lease portfolio size declined 1.4% year over year compared with a dip of 6% in the year-ago quarter. E-commerce revenues rose 20.8% year over year and represented 24% of lease revenues. For the first quarter, our model had predicted Aaron\u2019s business revenues of $390.4 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 5.3%.\r\n\r\nIn the BrandsMart segment, revenues decreased 8.1% to $132.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, mainly driven by a 9.4% decline in comparable sales. The decline in comparable sales was attributed to the ongoing weakness in customer traffic and customers\u2019 shift to lower-priced products across major categories.\r\n\r\nThe segment\u2019s e-commerce product sales slipped 9.2% year over year, representing 8.7% of the total product sales. E-commerce sales were mainly impacted by an increased shift to lower-priced products and a change in the category mix. Our estimate for BrandsMart segment revenues was $133 million for the first quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 7.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Aaron's Company, Inc.

        "title": "What Makes Skechers (SKX) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Skechers (SKX), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Skechers currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if SKX is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this shoe company holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nFor SKX, shares are up 2.58% over the past week while the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is down 0.17% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 15.69% compares favorably with the industry's 6.72% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Skechers have risen 13.9%, and are up 29.44% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 3.78% and 27.1%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to SKX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. SKX is currently averaging 2,180,648 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with SKX.\n\nOver the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SKX's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.81 to $4.02 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that SKX is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Skechers on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Notably, international DTC sales jumped 24.1%, while domestic sales increased 8%. The segment\u2019s success is bolstered by effective marketing strategies and continuous product innovation, particularly in comfort technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational Business Acts as Key Factor\n\nInternational operations have been acting as a key growth driver for Skechers, with a 15.2% increase in international sales in the first quarter of 2024, accounting for 64.5% of the total sales. The APAC region stood out with a 15.9% increase, showcasing SKX\u2019s ability to adapt to diverse consumer preferences and capitalize on emerging market trends.\r\n\r\nIn its push for expansion, Skechers opened 52 company-owned stores in the first quarter, focusing on international markets like China. Despite this expansion, the company strategically closed 29 stores, optimizing its retail footprint. The plan includes opening an additional 155-170 stores globally throughout 2024, emphasizing the integration of innovative comfort technologies and targeted marketing to enhance the retail experience.\n\nOptimistic Outlook\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Skechers projects sales between $8.73 billion and $8.88 billion, an increase from the previously mentioned $8.6-$8.8 billion.

        "title": "CROX, PVH, SKX: Which \u201cStrong Buy\u201d Apparel Stock Is Best?",
        "content": "Apparel stocks have been met with some serious volatility in recent quarters, with some of the high flyers suffering considerable falls from grace\u2014think PVH\u2014while some underdogs\u2014like SKX and CROX\u2014have seemingly swooped in to take share. Of course, only time will tell what could be next for these turbulent consumer discretionaries as macro headwinds, high rates, and inflation hit hard and consumers change their spending patterns.\n\nEither way, recent shifts in the apparel scene have been remarkable, and in this piece, we\u2019ll use TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to have a closer look at three apparel Strong Buys in the analyst community to see which comes out on top.\n\nCrox (NASDAQ:CROX)\n\nCrocs is a popular clog maker that exploded during pandemic lockdowns, soaring around 1,500% from its 2020 depths to its eventual November 2021 peak. Since peaking, Crox stock shed a big chunk of its lockdown-era gains, as it became less acceptable to spend most of one\u2019s day in a pair of arguably ugly but incredibly comfortable shoes.\n\nHowever, more recently, shares have begun to pick up traction, clocking in 75% of gains in the past two years. All of a sudden, those pandemic-era all-time highs aren\u2019t so far out of sight. With robust newfound momentum and the faith of most Wall Street analysts, I remain bullish on the stock.\n\nWith post-pandemic demand normalizing and growth back on the table, now seems like a great time to get back into the stock. Looking ahead, the firm seems poised to take a page out of the playbook of some of its footwear rivals by embracing collaborations.\n\nNotable collaborations with Nascar and anime Jujitsu Kisen could tap into very different fanbases that may not have otherwise considered spending a few dollars on comfortable footwear. Such limited edition \u201cdrops\u201d also tend to appeal to sneakerheads (footwear collectors). Indeed, such brand collaborations have resulted in numerous win-win propositions for a wide range of firms regardless of industry.\n\nSo, whether we\u2019re talking about the latest anime Crocs or a celeb-endorsed fast-food meal, it\u2019s clear collaborations are getting the attention of younger generations. With 30 HEYDUDE (Crocs\u2019 sister brand) outlets to be opened this year, analysts have the right to be upbeat as consumers shift from expensive sneakerhead brands toward cheaper, comfier alternatives.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for CROX Stock?\n\nCROX stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with nine Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average CROX stock price target of $143.17 implies 14.4% upside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nPVH (NYSE:PVH)\n\nPVH is a diversified apparel firm behind popular upscale brands such as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Van Heusen. With PVH, you\u2019ll gain exposure to casual attire, activewear, underwear, and accessories, just to name a few product categories. The stock has been a horrid roller-coaster ride through the past decade, surging and plunging on numerous occasions, ultimately ending lower by 15% over the timespan.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s frustrating to be a PVH shareholder, but I think there are plenty of reasons to stay the course. With intriguing catalysts and a depressed valuation to get behind, the next 10 years could have the potential to be a heck of a lot brighter than the last. All things considered, I remain bullish.\n\nMore recently, PVH stock shed around 22% on the back of some rough quarterly results. Wedbush Securities stepped forward, calling the plunge a buying opportunity, given its \u201cmargin expansion opportunity\u201d for its top brands and the potential for retail trends to shift favorably. I\u2019m inclined to agree. Wall Street may be overreacting to some quarterly results that I didn\u2019t think were all too bad.\n\nOf course, it was the muted 2024 outlook that had investors hitting that sell button. In light of the apparel industry volatility, I\u2019d argue the softer guidance was only prudent. Either way, I\u2019m a fan of the stock while it\u2019s going for 10.1 times trailing price-to-earnings.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of PVH Stock?\n\nPVH stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 12 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average PVH stock price target of $134.50 implies 21% upside potential.\n\nSkechers (NYSE:SKX)\n\nSkechers is a relatively small footwear firm that I did not expect would be trading close to all-time highs in the face of tremendous volatility in retail and apparel. I certainly didn\u2019t think it would have put footwear giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) to shame, with more than 100% in gains over the past five years versus Nike\u2019s mere 7% gain. Undoubtedly, Sketchers isn\u2019t just benefiting from a more value-conscious, inflation-rattled consumer. It has also done a lot to offer next-level comfort in its sneakers.\n\nCollaborations, marketing, and slick designs have also helped its cause. With another quarterly beat in the books, I\u2019m not inclined to give up SKX stock quite yet. Neither is Wall Street. As such, I\u2019m staying bullish on the $10.3 billion high flyer as it looks to leave its footwear rivals behind.\n\nSkechers delivered a solid first quarter (earnings per share of $1.37 vs. $1.10 estimate), but it was the hiked full-year guidance that really had investors piling into the stock. For 2024, sales are now expected to be in the $8.73-8.88 billion range, up from $8.6-8.8 billion. It\u2019s a slight forecast raise but a notable one nonetheless for a company that\u2019s found a way to make strides over its much larger peers.\n\nPerhaps Raymond James\u2019 Rick Patel put it best, Skechers is showing \u201cbroad-based strength in a lousy macro.\u201d As a discretionary with almost defensive characteristics and what appears to be some pretty durable growth, it\u2019s no mystery why analysts like Patel are fans of the stock right now.\n\nPatel has a Buy rating on SKX stock with a $72.00 price target, recently hiked from $66.00.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of SKX Stock?\n\nSKX stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average SKX stock price target of $68.50 implies 4.2% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe apparel scene has been hit with quite a bit of pressure, but not all players have succumbed to the industry woes. With promising trajectories and fairly modest multiples, the following apparel plays seem like interesting bets. As investors take profits on pricier growth stocks in favor of more value-rich offerings, analysts view PVH stock as having the most to gain, with an estimated upside of about 24%.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Skechers a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Skechers (SKX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SKX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nSkechers' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Skechers' main business drivers.\n\nFounded in 1992 and headquartered in Manhattan Beach, California, Skechers U.S.A., Inc. designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas under the SKECHERS name, as well as under several uniquely branded names.\r\n\r\nThrough its distribution networks, joint venture partners in Asia and the Middle East, and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Japan, throughout Europe and Latin America, Skechers\u2019 products are available in more than 180 countries and territories. As of Mar 31, 2024, SKX had 5,203 stores, including 565 domestic stores, 1,106 international locations, and 3,532 distributors, licensee and franchise stores.\r\n\r\nSkechers offers casuals, dress casuals, comfort and lightweight, sandals, and casual fusion categories for men and women under the Skechers USA brand; sport footwear for men and women, including men\u2019s lifestyle athletic footwear, lightweight women\u2019s sneakers, and sport sandals and boots under the Skechers Sport brand; fusion and sport fusion sneakers for females of all ages under the Skechers Active brand; and vulcanized looks and at Home collection under the brand BOBS from Skechers.\r\n\r\nThe company also provides casuals, field boots, hikers, and athletic shoes for men and women under the Skechers Work brand; boots, shoes, sandals, dress sneakers, and lighted footwear for infants, toddlers, boys, and girls under the Skechers Kids brand; and a vivid range of on-trend casual, dress and active styles for men under Mark Nason Collection.\r\n\r\nThe company also offers specially designed footwear collection under Skechers GOrun, Skechers GOwalk, Skechers, Skechers GOtrain, Skechers GOtrail, Skechers GO Golf and YOU by Skechers.\r\n\r\nSkechers reported segmental results for wholesale (63.1% of first-quarter 2024 total revenues) and direct-to-consumer (36.9% of first-quarter 2024 total revenues) operations, including its joint venture businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Skechers a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $4,679.06, or a gain of 367.91%, as of May 2, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 gained 166.41% and the price of gold went up 70.95% over the same time frame.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for SKX.\n\nSkechers strategically broadens its brand range, focusing on comfortable footwear amidst changing lifestyle preferences. Investments in global infrastructure support both online and offline growth, facilitating better customer interaction through seamless experiences. The wholesale segment thrives due to efficient inventory management and expansion into international markets. Strong direct-to-consumer sales reflect successful product innovations and targeted marketing efforts. Skechers plans to further expand its direct sales channels and global presence while investing in new stores. The upwardly revised fiscal 2024 projections following impressive first quarter performance, aligns with Skechers\u2019 strategic goals. Second-quarter sales forecasts reinforce positive momentum. Management is poised to attain $10 billion in sales by 2026.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 11.84%, and there have been 5 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Skechers (SKX) Is a Great Growth Stock",
        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Skechers (SKX) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this shoe company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Skechers is 21.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 15.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 15%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Skechers is 38.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -9.1%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 3.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Skechers have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 6.3% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSkechers has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Skechers well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 25, 2024\n\nSkechers U.S.A., Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.33, expectations were $1.1. Skechers U.S.A., Inc. isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to the Skechers\u2019 First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I\u2019m the General Manager of Store 2 in Gardena, California, and I\u2019ve been on the Skechers team for an exciting 11 years. Thank you for joining our Skechers conference call today.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Skechers\u2019 Chief Operating Officer, David Weinberg; and Chief Financial Officer, John Vandemore.\n\nDavid?\n\nDavid Weinberg: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2024 conference call, which marks our 100th as a public company. We started the year with a new quarterly sales record of $2.25 billion an increase of 12.5% or $250 million compared to last year and an adjusted diluted earnings per share record of $1.33. Additionally, we achieved gross margins of 52.5% and an operating margin of 13.3%. These impressive results were driven by growth in both our reportable segments, direct-to-consumer and wholesale as well as across all regions of the world. The strong global demand for our brand was due to fresh innovations in our proven styles, a more robust offering of our many comfort technologies and the expansion of our performance and lifestyle divisions into new categories and collections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese newer offerings include our partnership with Snoop Dogg and the Skechers football and basketball lines. As the comfort technology company, we focus first on delivering the ultimate and innovative comfort and style across our product lines, so that every pair looks and feels exceptional. This includes our machine washable footwear for kids, durable outdoor styles and sport styles and our street and court fashion collections. For our performance division, great attention and detail is paid to elevating the fit and comfort while meeting the needs of elite athletes and enthusiasts of football, basketball, golf, and pickleball as well as running and walking. Top professional athletes like Harry Kane, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Julius Randle, Terence Mann, Brooke Henderson, Matt Fitzpatrick, Catherine Parenteau and many others around the world are competing in Skechers and embracing our comfort that performs.\n\nThis enthusiasm from those at the top of their game is also resonating with consumers and the media, including Shape Magazine, which just named Skechers Viper Court the best pickleball shoe in their 2024 report and Sports Illustrated Germany, which featured Harry Kane on the cover wearing our SKX 01 football boots and Skechers performance apparel. The brand and each of these product initiatives are supported by impact for marketing initiatives. This year\u2019s commercial for the Super Bowl with Mr. T and Tony Romo to our first basketball campaigns with Julius and Terence. In the quarter, we launched new Spots for kids, BOBS, Max Cushioning and Work all with Skechers Hands Free Slip-ins. And just last week, we added a new lineup of commercials that includes Skechers UNO with actress Ashley Park and GO WALK Slip-ins and Apparel with TV host Amanda Kloots.\n\nAlong with these on air campaigns, we employ a 360 degree marketing approach reaching consumers at multiple touch points. To achieve the notable growth that we have this quarter and to continue to meet the needs of consumers around the world, it takes the effort and dedication of the entire global Skechers team, our designers and supply chain partners who ensure our product is of the highest quality and our third-party retailers whom we have valuable relationships with. We thank each associate, employee and colleague for working together for our continued success. Looking at our first quarter results. Sales increased 12.5% to $2.25 billion. International sales increased 15% representing approximately 65% of our total sales in the first quarter and domestic sales increased 7.8%.\n\nBy region, EMEA increased 17%, APAC by 16% and the Americas by 7.8%. Additionally, both wholesale and direct-to-consumer grew nicely in the quarter. Our wholesale sales increased 9.8% reflecting a return to growth in both international at 11% and domestic at 7.7%. Internationally, the increase was due in part to improved inventory position at certain partners, the growth of our distributors across geographies and particularly strong sales in China, Germany and the U.K. For domestic, the return to growth was a result of significant improvement in the flow of orders with both improved ASPs and volume. Skechers is in demand by many of our customers around the world as is evidenced by our strong sales. Direct-to-consumer, which increased 17% continues to be an important segment of our business and an indicator of positive consumer appetite for our brand.\n\nWith growth in nearly every market for both our brick and mortar and e-commerce stores, we saw a 24% increase internationally and an 8% increase domestically. We ended the quarter with 5,203 Skechers branded stores worldwide of which 1,671 are company-owned locations including 565 in the United States. We opened 52 company-owned stores in the quarter including 22 in China, 10 in the United States, five in Colombia and two in both India and Korea. We closed 29 stores in the quarter. Also in the period, 95 third-party stores opened including 54 in China, nine in Indonesia and three each in Australia, the Philippines and Turkey. This brings our third-party store count at quarter end to 3,532. In the second quarter to-date, we\u2019ve opened 15 stores including three company-owned stores in both China and the United States.\n\nWe expect to open 155 to 170 company-owned stores worldwide over the remainder of 2024. Our record sales in the quarter along with our efforts to manage inventory levels resulted in a 9.4% reduction year-over-year and an 11% reduction from December 31, 2023. We believe our inventory levels are healthy and comprised largely of proven sellers, fresh innovations and new product categories. To efficiently manage our inventory flow, we continue to invest in our logistic capabilities, including our new distribution center in Panama, which is expected to be operational in the second quarter as well as a new company operated DC in Colombia, which we plan to move into later this year. To efficiently grow our business worldwide and meet the needs of consumers seeking the ultimate and comfort technology, we continue to invest in our operations, product and marketing.\n\nWith our numerous accomplishments over the past quarter, we look forward to strategically growing our business in the coming year as well as in the years ahead. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to John, for more details on our financial results.\n\nJohn Vandemore: Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Skechers delivered another strong quarter of record financial performance, exceeding both our top and bottom line expectations. Our diverse portfolio of high-quality products combined with our commitment to delivering these products at a reasonable price clearly resonates with today\u2019s consumer. We achieved record sales of $2.25 billion growing 12.5% and earnings per share of $1.33 growing 30% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, sales were $2.27 billion and earnings per share were $1.37. These results were driven by a healthy recovery in our wholesale segment, particularly in the United States and Europe and continued momentum in our direct-to-consumer segment.\n\nDespite persistent economic headwinds, our performance this quarter underscores the strength of the Skechers brand worldwide and the consumer demand for our innovative products together driving us towards our goal of achieving $10 billion in sales by 2026. Consumers understand that comfort is no longer a luxury, but a requirement that shouldn\u2019t come at a cost. Skechers excels where comfort and value intersect as evidenced by the strength of our global direct-to-consumer business, which grew 17% year-over-year to $829.9 million. These results were driven by double-digit growth in our e-commerce and brick and mortar stores and increases of 24% internationally and 8% domestically. Our commitment to prioritizing innovation and supporting this with effective marketing powered these results. A sportsperson running with style and grace, embodying the company's performance footwear.\n\nWe remain excited about our omnichannel growth opportunities and we\u2019ll continue to deliver on our strategy to expand our direct-to-consumer presence worldwide. In wholesale, sales increased 9.8% year-over-year to $1.42 billion with growth across all regions. As expected, we are seeing a recovery in domestic wholesale with sales increasing 7.7% versus the prior year. Notably, we experienced a significant improvement in the flow of orders including customers taking goods earlier within their shipping windows. International wholesale sales also returned to growth increasing 11% as the inventory congestion impacting certain partners particularly in Europe abated. We remain encouraged by our wholesale segment, both domestically and internationally and continue to expect year-over-year growth as we move through the balance of the year.\n\nNow, turning to our regional sales. In the Americas, sales for the first quarter increased 7.8% year-over-year to $1.02 billion reflective of the improvements in our domestic wholesale business, which accounted for nearly half of the growth and the continued strength of our direct-to-consumer segment. In particular, our domestic direct-to-consumer business grew at 8%. Although this represents a step down from the robust growth of the prior year, on a two-year basis, this reflects a remarkable 35% increase in sales. In EMEA, sales increased 17% year-over-year to $627.7 million driven by double-digit growth in both segments with broad strength in nearly every country. Our investments to enhance our distribution infrastructure direct-to-consumer experience coupled with our strong wholesale partnerships are producing outstanding results for our EMEA business.\n\nWe also saw notable performance in our direct-to-consumer channels with impressive growth across genders and categories ranging from athletic to lifestyle and seasonal products. In Asia Pacific, sales increased 16% year-over-year to $604.5 million led by double-digit growth in most markets. In China sales grew 13% driven by double-digit growth in both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale segments. In India, sales were up slightly as we resolved logistical challenges with our new distribution center. While the regulatory environment in the market is uncertain in the near-term, we continue to be confident in the growth opportunities for our brand long-term. Gross margin was 52.5% up 360 basis points compared to the prior year. The improvement was driven by lower freight costs and a favorable product mix as consumers sought out our higher margin technology infused products.\n\nOperating expenses increased 150 basis points as a percentage of sales year-over-year to 39.2%. Selling expenses increased 50 basis points as a percentage of sales versus last year to 7%, primarily due to increased marketing globally including investments focused on brand building and driving consumer awareness for our comfort technology products and newly launched categories. General and administrative expenses increased 100 basis points as a percentage of sales to 32.3% primarily due to higher labor and distribution costs to support growth in our direct-to-consumer segment and compensation related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies realized in our U.S. and Europe distribution centers. Earnings from operations were $298.8 million a 34% increase compared to the prior year and our operating margin for the quarter was 13.3% compared to 11.2% last year.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the first quarter was 19% compared to 18.5% in the prior year. Earnings per share were $1.33 per diluted share, a 30% increase on $155.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And now, turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.25 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, an increase of $322.2 million versus the prior year primarily from improved working capital management and operating efficiency. Inventory was $1.36 billion a decrease of 9.4% or $141.6 million compared to the prior year. Notably, we lowered inventory levels in the Americas by 18% and EMEA by 6.9% compared to the prior year. We believe our current inventory levels are healthy and well-positioned to support demand in 2024.\n\nAccounts receivable at quarter-end were $1.16 billion an increase of $105.7 million compared to the prior year reflecting higher wholesale sales. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $57.1 million of which $24.3 million related to investments in new store openings and direct-to-consumer technologies, $15.6 million related to the expansion of our distribution infrastructure and $7.4 million related to the construction of our new corporate offices. Our capital investments are focused on supporting our strategic priorities, which include growing our direct-to-consumer segment and expanding our brand presence globally. During the first quarter, we repurchased nearly 1 million shares of our Class A common stock at a cost of $60 million. We continue to deploy our capital consistent with our stated philosophy while maintaining a durable balance sheet and ample liquidity.\n\nNow, turning to guidance. For the full-year 2024, we expect sales in the range of $8.725 billion to $8.875 billion and net earnings per share in the range of $3.95 to $4.10 representing annual growth of 10% and 15% respectively at the midpoint. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.175 billion to $2.225 billion and net earnings per share in the range of $0.85 to $0.90. Earnings per share will be down slightly in the quarter due primarily to the timing of demand creation spending, which is typically highest during the second quarter as we amplify consumer awareness for our product portfolio and position our brand for a successful summer and back-to-school periods. We believe this investment is critical to driving growth on a full-year basis and one of the reasons why we are fully incorporating this quarter\u2019s outperformance into our full-year guidance.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the year is expected to be between 19% and 20% and minority interest is expected to grow in-line with total sales. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be between $325 million and $375 million as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities, including opening additional stores, expanding our omnichannel capabilities and adding incremental distribution capacity in key markets, including constructing our second distribution center in China, a 2 million square foot facility, which will likely elevate our capital expenditures this year and next. We remain confident in our objective of achieving $10 billion in sales by 2026 and are well-positioned to drive long-term earnings growth. We thank you all for your time today and look forward to updating you on our second financial results, which we expect to release on Thursday, July 25.\n\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to, David for closing remarks.\n\nDavid Weinberg: Thank you, John. We started the year on a high note by setting new quarterly sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share records with strong gross and operating margins. We delivered results above expectations and further expanded globally with a growing presence in the technical performance space and our innovative comfort footwear continuing to be a must have for shoppers around the world. Skechers is delivering on its fundamental design tenets of style, comfort, innovation and quality at a reasonable price, which is resonating with shoppers from all walks of life. We believe comfort is a top priority and that casual and athletic are in high demand, while e-commerce continues to exhibit strength, people are also looking to engage and shop in our physical stores.\n\nWe are committed to delivering high-performance comfort technical footwear while broadening our offering of Skechers Hands Free Slip-ins, developing new looks in our sport, street and casual divisions, enhancing the Skechers shopping experience at all touch points and operating in an increasingly efficient manner. Our extensive product offering, best-in-class partnerships with our distribution network and strong global demand give us confidence that we will have another record breaking year as we continue to evolve and innovate and move toward our goal of $10 billion in annual sales by 2026. We again want to thank our entire supply chain and the Skechers\u2019 team for delivering another successful quarter. I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all involved for their continued efforts assisting in delivering these results as we mark our 100th call.\n\nNow, I would like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.\n\nJohn Vandemore: Actually, before turning to the operator, I want to take a moment to commemorate this, our 100th earnings call as a public company. Skechers began trading on June 9, 1999. Many of the employees present that day continue to be deeply involved in the company, including our management team. However, only one person has been on each and every one of our earnings calls since going public. As we celebrate today\u2019s milestone of our 100th earnings call, we want to take a moment to acknowledge and honor the remarkable commitment of David Weinberg, our Chief Operating Officer. For over 30 years, he has been integral to Skechers\u2019 success and his dedication has been unwavering. So, on behalf of Skechers\u2019 Board of Directors, Senior Management team and employees worldwide, I would like to sincerely thank Mr. David Weinberg.\n\nI also want to extend heartfelt gratitude to the many other key contributors to the earnings process, including Jennifer Clay, our Vice President of Corporate Communications as well as our dedicated finance, accounting, investor relations and legal departments, all of whom have contributed to our journey of growth and success as a public company. With that said, I will now turn the call over to the operator.\n\nSee also\n\nThe World's 30 Least Powerful Passports in 2024 and\n\n20 Cheapest Countries to Study Abroad.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Skechers (SKX) Reliance on International Sales: What Investors Need to Know",
        "content": "Have you evaluated the performance of Skechers' (SKX) international operations during the quarter that concluded in March 2024? Considering the extensive worldwide presence of this shoe company, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial resilience and potential for growth.\n\nIn today's increasingly interconnected global economy, a company's ability to tap into international markets can be a pivotal factor in shaping its overall financial health and growth trajectory. For investors, understanding a company's reliance on overseas markets has become increasingly crucial, as it offers insights into the company's sustainability of earnings, ability to tap into diverse economic cycles and overall growth potential.\n\nBeing present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However, this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.\n\nWhile analyzing SKX's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nThe recent quarter saw the company's total revenue reaching $2.25 billion, marking an improvement of 12.5% from the prior-year quarter. Next, we'll examine the breakdown of SKX's revenue from abroad to comprehend the significance of its international presence.\n\nTrends in SKX's Revenue from International Markets\n\nOf the total revenue, $627.6 million came from Europe, Middle East & Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 27.9%. This represented a surprise of +15.94% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $541.31 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $383.5 million, or 19.6%, and $534.5 million, or 26.7%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nDuring the quarter, Asia Pacific contributed $604.5 million in revenue, making up 26.9% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $594.12 million, this meant a surprise of +1.75%. Looking back, Asia Pacific contributed $622 million, or 31.7%, in the previous quarter, and $521.5 million, or 26.1%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nInternational Revenue Predictions\n\nWall Street analysts expect Skechers to report $2.19 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 8.9% from the year-ago quarter. Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia Pacific are expected to contribute 20.3% ($445.34 million) and 27.6% ($604.26 million) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the full year, the company is projected to achieve a total revenue of $8.82 billion, which signifies a rise of 10.2% from the last year. The share of this revenue from various regions is expected to be: Europe, Middle East & Africa at 21.8% ($1.92 billion) and Asia Pacific at 28.4% ($2.5 billion).\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nSkechers' reliance on international markets for revenues offers both opportunities and risks. Hence, keeping an eye on its international revenue trends could significantly help forecast the company's prospects.\n\nIn an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying, Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends, particularly for firms with overseas operations, to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover, a range of other aspects, including how a company fares in its home country, significantly affects these projections.\n\nWe at Zacks strongly focus on the dynamic earnings forecast of companies, given that empirical studies have demonstrated its potent impact on the immediate price movement of stocks. Invariably, there's a positive relationship -- upward earnings predictions often result in an increase in stock prices.\n\nOur proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, with its externally validated exceptional track record, harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions to serve as a dependable measure for anticipating the short-term price trends of stocks.\n\nCurrently, Skechers holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), signifying its potential to match the overall market's performance in the forthcoming period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nA Review of Skechers' Recent Stock Market Performance\n\nOver the past month, the stock has seen an increase of 6.8% in its value, whereas the Zacks S&P 500 composite has posted a decrease of 2%. The Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, Skechers' industry group, has descended 6.2% over the identical span. In the past three months, there's been an increase of 14.7% in the company's stock price, against a rise of 4.6% in the S&P 500 index.

        "title": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Just Recorded A 21% EPS Beat: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Next",
        "content": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX) just released its latest first-quarter results and things are looking bullish. The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$2.3b, some 2.3% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$1.33, 21% ahead of expectations. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nView our latest analysis for Skechers U.S.A  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nAfter the latest results, the 13 analysts covering Skechers U.S.A are now predicting revenues of US$8.85b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a modest 7.3% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to rise 6.6% to US$4.04. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$8.79b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.93 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Skechers U.S.A's earnings potential following these results.\n\nThere's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$73.19, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Skechers U.S.A, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$88.00 and the most bearish at US$60.00 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Skechers U.S.A shareholders.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that Skechers U.S.A's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 9.8% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 13% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.0% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while Skechers U.S.A's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Skechers U.S.A's earnings potential next year. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$73.19, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Skechers U.S.A. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

        "content": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX delivered impressive first-quarter 2024 results, with the top and bottom lines outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, both metrics improved year over year. The company's performance improved due to the strong brand appeal and high demand for its comfort-focused products, complemented by robust marketing and distribution efforts.\r\n\r\nDemand for comfort technology products, advantageous pricing, and increases in wholesale and direct-to-consumer sales positively impacted the outcomes. Management is focused on its long-term growth plan, which involves expanding its international footprint and deepening its direct-to-consumer connections. The company is aiming to reach a sales goal of $10 billion by 2026, reflecting its optimistic outlook and confidence in its prospects.\r\n\r\nOver the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 27.6% against the industry\u2019s 0.9% decline.\n\nSkechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nSkechers U.S.A., Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Quote\n\nQ1 Highlights\n\nSkechers posted first-quarter earnings of $1.33 per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of $1.10. Also, the bottom line rose 30.4% from the year-earlier quarter.\r\n\r\nSKX generated sales of $2,251.6 million, lagging the consensus estimate of $2,186 million. However, the top line grew 12.5% year over year, driven by 15.2% growth in international sales and a 7.8% increase in domestic sales. Increases in domestic and international sales were driven by robust direct-to-consumer (\u201cDTC\u201d) and Wholesale sales. On a constant-currency basis, total sales grew 13.4%.\r\n\r\nWe note that the company\u2019s wholesale sales increased 9.8% year over year to $1.42 billion, while DTC rose 17.3% to $829.9 million. Our estimate for wholesale and DTC sales was pegged at $1.35 billion and $839.4 million, respectively.\r\n\r\nWholesale sales increased 5.9% year over year in the Americas (\u201cAMER\u201d), 11.5% in Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EMEA) and 15.3% in the Asia Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d). Wholesale average selling price per unit was flat, whereas the unit volume increased 9.9% year over year.\r\n\r\nDTC sales growth included increases of 8% in domestic DTC sales and 24.1% in international DTC sales. The DTC unit volume rose 15.5% and the average selling price grew 1.6%. Also, growth of 10.5% in the AMER, 16.5% in the APAC and 62.4% in the EMEA aided the segment\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nRegion-wise, sales increased 7.8% year over year to $1.02 billion in the AMER, 17.4% to $627.6 million in the EMEA and 15.9% to $604.5 million in the APAC. We expected sales from the AMER and APAC regions to increase 9.2% and 17.7%, respectively, for the quarter under review.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMargins & Costs\n\nGross profit increased 20.7% year over year to $1.18 billion. Also, the gross margin expanded 360 basis points (bps) to 52.5%, primarily driven by lower costs per unit due to a decline in freight costs and higher average selling prices. We expected the metric to expand 50 bps to 49.4% for the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nTotal operating expenses grew 16.9% year over year to $882.8 million. The metric, as a percentage of sales, increased 150 bps to 39.2%. We expected total operating expenses to rise 12% for the quarter.\r\n\r\nSelling expenses grew 21.7% from the year-ago period to $156.5 million. Also, general and administrative expenses jumped 15.9% to $726.3 million. Increased costs resulted from higher brand demand creation expenditure, along with elevated facility costs, such as rent and depreciation.\n\nOther Financial Aspects\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.02 billion, whereas short-term investments amounted to $88.6 million.\r\n\r\nSkechers ended the quarter with long-term borrowings of $112.5 million and shareholders\u2019 equity of $4.15 billion, excluding non-controlling interests of $407.6 million. The total inventory decreased 10.8% year over year to $1.36 billion. The company incurred a capital expenditure of $57.1 million in the quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, management repurchased 1 million shares of its Class A common stock for $60 million. As of Mar 31, 2023, $205.7 million was available under SKX\u2019s share buyback program.\n\nStore Update\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, SKX had 5,203 stores, including 565 domestic stores, 1,106 international locations, and 3,532 distributors, licensee and franchise stores.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter, the company opened 10 domestic stores, 42 international stores, and 95 distributors, licensee and franchise stores. It closed eight domestic stores, 21 international stores, and 83 distributor, licensee and franchise stores in the same period.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, management targets sales between $8.73 billion and $8.88 billion compared with the previously mentioned $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion. It predicts earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) between $3.95 and $4.10 compared with the previously stated $3.65 and $3.85. Management anticipates a capital expenditure of $325-$375 million for 2024.\r\n\r\nFor the second quarter of 2024, SKX is likely to achieve sales between $2.18 billion and $2.23 billion and EPS between 85 cents and 90 cents.\n\nKey Picks\n\nA few better-ranked stocks are American Eagle Outfitters Inc.

        "content": "Why Skechers (SKX) Stock Is Trading Up Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of footwear company Skechers (NYSE:SKX) jumped 17.4% in the morning session after the company reported a rare 'beat and raise' quarters. Skechers blew past analysts' constant currency revenue expectations. Its operating margin also outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Looking forward to the full year, the company raised its revenue and EPS guidance for 2024, and both are comfortably ahead of analysts' expectations. Overall, this quarter's results seemed fairly positive, and shareholders should feel optimistic.\n\nIs now the time to buy Skechers? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nSkechers's shares are not very volatile than the market average and over the last year have had only 3 moves greater than 5%. Moves this big are very rare for Skechers and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nSkechers is up 7% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Skechers's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,133.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

        "content": "In this article, we shall discuss the 25 best sportswear brands in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the global sports apparel industry in 2024, go directly and see The 10 Best Sportswear Brands in the World.\n\nThe Global Sports Apparel Industry: An Overview\n\nSports apparel refers to the clothes that one wears while engaging in physical activity and sport such as hiking, running and yoga. Sports apparel consumers tend to engage with the industry via online and offline distribution channels, causing the market to experience a steady growth in a post-pandemic environment. In 2023, the global sports apparel industry was valued at more than $203.3 billion and is projected to reach $271.8 billion by 2030, at an impressive CAGR of 4.24% during the forecast period. The industry's impressive growth projections are predicated on the fact that the industry is well-positioned to capitalize on some of the tailwinds affecting the market, like new product innovation and increasing participation in sports activities post-COVID in enormous markets like India, the U.S. and China. There is also an increasing global preference for recreational activities especially amongst the younger demographic which has been further fueling the demand for the best sportswear brands in the world. In 2023, more than 54% of Americans aged 6 years or above engaged in at least one physical activity, according to the 2023 Outdoor Trends Report by the Outdoor Industry Association. You can read more on trends affecting the global sports apparel industry in our article 15 Highest Quality Athletic Wear Brands in the US.\n\nA good indicator of the tailwinds affecting the sportswear industry in 2024 is improving investor sentiment around major players like Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE). The stock\u2019s valuation is expected to skyrocket amid reports that WNBA star Caitlin Clark is slated to sign a $28 million contract with Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE). In Q1 2024, the stock raked in earnings of $0.98 per share, beating EPS estimates of $0.74 by $0.24. In the last five years, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is up more than 7.17% as of April 25. Moreover, investor sentiment around the stock has also improved considering the fact that the company has unveiled plans to cut 2% of its workforce to improve efficiency and reduce spending. This has caused the stock to deliver top-line growth of 0.3% year on year, beating analyst expectations by 1.1%.\n\nAnother major stock in the sports apparel industry is Skechers USA Inc. (\n\nNYSE:SKX), which is an American multinational footwear and apparel industry which primarily focuses on sportswear and casual wear and is one of the best sportswear brands in the world. In 2023, the stock raked in an annual revenue of more than $8 billion and in the last five years, is up more than 89.83% as of April 25. In Q1 2023, Skechers USA Inc. (\n\nStory continues\n\nNYSE:SKX) delivered an EPS of $0.56, beating estimates of $0.55 by $0.01, signaling a strong quarter for the stock.\n\nThe TJX Companies, Inc. (\n\nNYSE:TJX), which is an American multinational off-price department store corporation, is also one of the best sportswear brands in the world due to its extensive sportswear portfolio. In Q1 2024, the stock delivered earnings of $1.22 per share, beating EPS estimates of $1.12 by $0.1. In the last five years, The TJX Companies, Inc. (\n\nNYSE:TJX) is up more than 73.05% as of April 25. On April 25, Goldman Sachs analyst Brooke Roach raised the price target on The TJX Companies Inc. (\n\nNYSE:TJX) to $110 from $110, and changed the rating on the stock from Neutral to Buy, considering its dividend yield of 1.57% and expectations that the company will keep paying out more than 37% of its profits over the next three years.\n\nWinning the China Market: Key Trends\n\nAs we mentioned in our article on the\u00a015 Biggest Clothing Manufacturing Countries in the World, the market in China for the best sportswear brands in the world continues to be one of the most dynamic in the world, with the industry projected to deliver double-digit growth catalyzed by a growing middle class. Local players in the Chinese market are integrating more efficient operating models and supply chain mechanisms and thereby, are outpacing global companies like Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Skechers USA Inc. (NYSE:SKX), and The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX). They are also harnessing the power of social media and e-commerce channels in a bid to form direct connections with the average consumer. In a bid to strengthen long-term competitiveness in the Chinese space, global brands are divesting greater investment in tailoring their brand positioning to attract local consumers and develop a local marketing engine to deliver genuine value proposition. According to McKinsey, global players are also realizing the shift from traditional departmental retailers to shopping malls in premium locations, which offer a more diverse lifestyle experience and food and beverage options. Hence, to capitalize upon this massive shift in consumer preferences, some of the best sportswear brands in the world are realigning store network presence in more lucrative traffic centers.\n\nOne major trend in the Chinese market is that consumers have adopted the omnichannel approach and tend to oscillate frequently between online and offline touchpoints before purchasing the best sportswear brands in the world. In a bid to capitalize upon this changing dynamic, companies looking to make a footprint in China like Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Skechers USA Inc. (NYSE:SKX), and The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX) are investing in targeted actions to implement an efficient omnichannel D2C strategy. In order to capture the value at stake, these companies are upgrading existing digital touchpoints in order to improve customer experience whilst training store staff for better consumer engagement. They are also incentivizing omnichannel customer acquisition independent of physical outlets.\n\nDespite starting off with their global assets and IP as a bedrock of innovation, the\u00a0 are now incorporating and integrating design elements that resonate with local tastes and trends. In a bid to compete with local players, companies like Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Skechers USA Inc. (NYSE:SKX), and The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX) are reinvigorating their organizational structure and speeding up time to market by adopting 'test and chase' models. Best Sportswear Brands in the World\n\nAugust_0802 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the  the 25 best sportswear brands in the world, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources and research. We then shortlisted more than 40 brands which appeared most frequently during our research. Since quality of a sportswear brand is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we decided to consider a 2016 market research report by the Institute of Business Research, which surveyed dozens of respondents to determine the factors which influence consumers' purchase intention and willingness to pay for sportswear brands. We used some of the most common findings to establish a five-pronged criteria; the criteria is premised on each brand's design value (10 points), durability (10 points), innovation (10 points), inclusive sizing options (10 points), and sustainability (10 points). We then proceeded to award each brand a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 25 brands which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the brand's design value, durability and innovation scores.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "Skechers (SKX) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.02 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 20.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this shoe company would post earnings of $0.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.56, delivering a surprise of 7.69%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nSkechers , which belongs to the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, posted revenues of $2.25 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.98%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nSkechers shares have lost about 5.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Skechers?\n\nWhile Skechers has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Skechers: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.04 on $2.17 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.81 on $8.73 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

        "title": "Skechers (NYSE:SKX) Beats Q1 Sales Targets, Stock Soars",
        "content": "Skechers (NYSE:SKX) Beats Q1 Sales Targets, Stock Soars\n\nFootwear company Skechers (NYSE:SKX) announced better-than-expected results in Q1 CY2024, with revenue up 12.5% year on year to $2.25 billion. The company expects next quarter's revenue to be around $2.2 billion, in line with analysts' estimates. It made a GAAP profit of $1.33 per share, improving from its profit of $1.02 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Skechers? Find out in our full research report.\n\nSkechers (SKX) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $2.25 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.2 billion (2.3% beat) EPS: $1.33 vs analyst estimates of $1.10 (20.6% beat) Revenue and EPS Guidance for full year 2024 both raised, both above Consensus expectations Gross Margin (GAAP): 52.5%, up from 48.9% in the same quarter last year Store Locations: 5,203 at quarter end, increasing by 654 over the last 12 months Market Capitalization: $9.24 billion\n\n\u201cWe began the new year by setting a new sales record, delivering results above expectations, and further expanding the Skechers brand globally,\u201d said Robert Greenberg, Chief Executive Officer of Skechers.\n\nSynonymous with \"dad shoe\", Skechers (NYSE:SKX) is a footwear company renowned for its comfortable, stylish, and affordable shoes for all ages.\n\nFootwear\n\nBefore the advent of the internet, styles changed, but consumers mainly bought shoes by visiting local brick-and-mortar shoe, department, and specialty stores. Today, not only do styles change more frequently as fads travel through social media and the internet but consumers are also shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some footwear companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind.\n\nSales Growth\n\nA company\u2019s long-term performance can give signals about its business quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one may grow for years. Skechers's annualized revenue growth rate of 12.1% over the last five years was mediocre for a consumer discretionary business. Skechers Total Revenue\n\nWithin consumer discretionary, a long-term historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or emerging trend. That's why we also follow short-term performance. Skechers's recent history shows the business has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 11% over the last two years is below its five-year trend.\n\nSkechers also reports sales performance excluding currency movements, which are outside the company\u2019s control and not indicative of demand. Over the last two years, its constant currency sales averaged 13.3% year-on-year growth. Because this number is higher than its revenue growth during the same period, we can see that foreign exchange rates have been a headwind for Skechers.\n\nStory continues Skechers Year-On-Year Constant Currency Revenue Growth\n\nThis quarter, Skechers reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 12.5%, and its $2.25 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street's estimates by 2.3%. The company is guiding for revenue to rise 9.3% year on year to $2.2 billion next quarter, improving from the 7.7% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 9.4% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability. It\u2019s the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses\u2013everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. Operating margin is also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\n\nSkechers was profitable over the last two years but held back by its large expense base. It's demonstrated mediocre profitability for a consumer discretionary business, producing an average operating margin of 9.2%. Skechers Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nIn Q1, Skechers generated an operating profit margin of 13.3%, up 2.1 percentage points year on year.\n\nOver the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Skechers to maintain its LTM operating margin of 10.4%.\n\nKey Takeaways from Skechers's Q1 Results\n\nThis was one of those rare 'beat and raise' quarters you love to see. We were impressed by how significantly Skechers blew past analysts' constant currency revenue expectations this quarter. We were also excited its operating margin outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Looking forward to the full year, the company raised its revenue and EPS guidance for 2024 and both are comfortably ahead of analysts' expectations. Overall, this quarter's results seemed fairly positive and shareholders should feel optimistic. The stock is up 7.4% after reporting and currently trades at $63.15 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Skechers right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

For the quarter, international sales represented 65% of total sales, and we achieved growth in all regions: 17% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa; 16% in Asia Pacific; and 8% in the Americas.

With the strong global demand for our brand and a healthy inventory position comprised of proven sellers, innovative technologies and new product categories, we believe that we have significant opportunities for growth across the globe, and we remain confident in our on-going success.\"\n\n\"We began the new year by setting a new sales record, delivering results above expectations, and further expanding the Skechers brand globally,\" said Robert Greenberg, Chief Executive Officer of Skechers. \"The broad-based growth is the result of our team\u2019s dedication to delivering exceptional product for consumers of all ages and interests and supporting our initiatives with targeted and effective demand creation. Once again, we created a memorable commercial for the Super Bowl \u2013 this year with Mr. T and Tony Romo. In the quarter, we also broadcast our first Skechers Basketball campaigns starring NBA players Julius Randle and Terence Mann, entered the world of cricket by sponsoring one of the leading men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams in India, and grew our roster of Premier League footballers with the addition of Oleksandr Zinchenko. Along with our signature capsules with Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg, we designed high-performance cleats for three more MLB players \u2013 Aaron Nola, Chris Taylor, and Brendan Donovan \u2013 and developed an even more robust offering of Skechers Hands Free Slip-ins footwear, which has become the number one Skechers comfort technology product in most markets.

Direct-to-Consumer volume increased 15.5% and average selling price increased 1.6%.\n\nGross margin was 52.5%, an increase of 360 basis points, primarily due to lower costs per unit, driven by lower freight costs and higher average selling prices.\n\nOperating expenses increased $127.8 million, or 16.9%, and as a percentage of sales increased 150 basis points to 39.2%. Selling expenses increased $27.9 million, or 21.7%, and as a percentage of sales increased 50 basis points to 7.0%. The increase was due to higher demand creation expenditures. General and administrative expenses increased $99.9 million, or 15.9%, and as a percentage of sales increased 100 basis points to 32.3%. Increased expenses were primarily driven by increased labor and facility costs, including rent and depreciation.\n\nEarnings from operations increased $75.2 million, or 33.6%, to $298.8 million, resulting in an operating margin of 13.3%.\n\nNet earnings were $206.6 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.33 compared with prior year net earnings of $160.4 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.02.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate was 19.0%.\n\n\"Skechers continues to reach new milestones in expanding our global footprint.

Decreases were partially offset by increased earnings.\n\nInventory was $1.36 billion, a decrease of $164.8 million or 10.8% from December 31, 2023.\n\nShare Repurchase\n\nDuring the first quarter, the Company repurchased 1.0 million shares of its Class A common stock at a cost of $60.0 million.

        "title": "Investing in Skechers (SKX) Ahead of Q1 Earnings: Risks &amp; Rewards",
        "content": "As Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX gears up to unveil its first-quarter 2024 earnings results on Apr 25 after market close, investors find themselves at a crossroads, weighing the potential upsides and downsides of investing in this prominent footwear giant. With a track record of innovation, global expansion and solid financial performance, Skechers presents an intriguing investment opportunity. However, like any investment, it comes with its own set of challenges and uncertainties.\r\n\r\nAnalysts' expectations paint a promising picture for Skechers' upcoming earnings, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues standing at $2,186 million, which signals a notable 9.3% improvement from the prior-year figure.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the company is anticipated to witness a year-over-year increase in its bottom line, with the consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings per share holding steady at $1.10 over the past 30 days. This forecast suggests an uptick of 7.8% from last year, hinting at potential earnings growth for Skechers amid a dynamic landscape.\r\n\r\nWell, the decision to invest in Skechers ahead of its first-quarter earnings requires careful consideration of both potential rewards and inherent risks.\n\nAssessing Skechers' Pros & Cons\n\nSkechers' recent performance has been impressive, with the company achieving record annual sales of $8 billion in 2023. This growth trajectory was supported by robust quarterly sales records, including fourth-quarter revenues of $1,960.9 million. Such consistent sales growth underscores the strong demand for Skechers products globally, reflecting positively on the company's brand strength and market position.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Skechers' strategic initiatives, such as expanding into categories like football and basketball, demonstrate its commitment to innovation and diversification. Collaborations with top-tier athletes and celebrities, coupled with effective marketing campaigns, have helped elevate brand awareness and drive consumer engagement.\r\n\r\nThe company's direct-to-consumer segment also continues to show strength, surpassing 50% of total sales for the first time. We anticipate direct-to-consumer revenues to increase 18.7% in the first quarter. This growth is fueled by expected improvements of 15.7% and 20.8% in the domestic and international direct-to-consumer businesses, respectively.\r\n\r\nSkechers' omnichannel strategy, along with its expanding retail footprint worldwide, positions it well to capitalize on evolving consumer preferences and shopping behaviors. Also, the company's focus on operational efficiency and cost management should support top and bottom-line growth.\r\n\r\nWhile Skechers' growth prospects appear promising, investors must also consider the risks. One notable challenge is the decline in wholesale sales, particularly in the domestic market. Conservative inventory management by retailers and inventory congestion issues in certain regions have weighed on wholesale performance. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors such as inflation and higher interest rates pose potential challenges for Skechers, impacting consumer spending behavior and overall company performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nSkechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nSkechers U.S.A., Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Quote\n\nUnlocking Value in Skechers\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Skechers shares present an attractive opportunity, trading at a discount relative to historical and industry benchmarks. With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 14.94, below the five-year median of 15.24 and the Shoes and Retail Apparel industry\u2019s average of 22.01, the stock offers compelling value for investors seeking exposure to the sector. Additionally, the stock currently has a Value Score of B, further validating its appeal.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the growth trajectory for Skechers appears promising, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the current and next fiscal year standing at $8.73 billion and $9.55 billion, respectively. These figures indicate year-over-year growth of 9.1% and 9.4%. Similarly, the consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $3.81 and $4.37 for the same periods, which suggests an increase of 9.2% and 14.7%, respectively. These optimistic projections reinforce the value proposition of investing in Skechers.\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Skechers this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\r\n\r\nSkechers currently has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.34%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\n3 More Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nHere are three more companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season:\r\n\r\nTractor Supply Company TSCO currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% and a Zacks Rank #2.

        "content": "Skechers (SKX) Q1 Earnings: What To Expect\n\nFootwear company Skechers (NYSE:SKX) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow after market hours. Here's what investors should know.\n\nLast quarter Skechers reported revenues of $1.96 billion, up 4.4% year on year, missing analyst expectations by 3.7%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' revenue estimates.\n\nIs Skechers buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Skechers's revenue to grow 9.9% year on year to $2.2 billion, in line with the 10% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.11 per share. Skechers Total Revenue\n\nThe analysts covering the company have been growing increasingly bearish\u00a0 about the business heading into the earnings, with revenue estimates seeing three downward revisions over the last thirty days.The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Skechers's peers in the consumer discretionary segment, some of them have already reported Q1 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. Nike delivered top-line growth of 0.3% year on year, beating analyst estimates by 1.1% and Carnival reported revenues up 22% year on year, inline with analysts'\u00a0estimates. Nike traded down 7% on the results, Carnival was down 4.1%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Nike's results here and Carnival's results here.\n\nTechnology stocks have been hit hard on fears of higher interest rates and while some of the consumer discretionary stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share price declining 4.1% over the last month. Skechers is down 1.6% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $69.9, compared to share price of $59.04.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports first-quarter 2024 earnings results on Apr 25 after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2,188 million, which indicates an improvement of 9.3% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe company, renowned for its design, marketing and distribution of footwear, apparel and accessories, is expected to observe a year-over-year increase in its bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share has been stable at $1.10 in the past 30 days, which suggests an improvement of 7.8% from the year-ago period.\r\n\r\nSkechers has maintained a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 45.7%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Goleta, CA-based company\u2019s bottom line outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 7.7%.\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nSkechers' focused strategy on growing its direct-to-consumer business and providing innovative, superior-quality products emerges as a key factor in driving revenues. The brand's commitment to expanding its retail footprint, enhancing omnichannel capabilities and reinforcing distribution strengths plays a crucial role in solidifying its market stance and securing continuous growth.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate direct-to-consumer revenues to increase 18.7% in the first quarter. This growth is fueled by expected improvements of 15.7% and 20.8% in the domestic and international direct-to-consumer businesses, respectively.\r\n\r\nSkechers did face significant challenges in its wholesale segment. However, the tides are now turning in favor of the company, thanks to positive order trends for the first half of the year. We foresee sales from the wholesale channel to increase 4.5% in the quarter.\r\n\r\nSKX's international business has been a major contributor to its sales. Skechers' success in international markets reflects its ability to adapt to diverse consumer preferences, capitalize on emerging trends and leverage effective distribution strategies tailored to each region's unique dynamics. As Skechers continues to expand its global presence and strengthen its brand recognition, the international segment remains a key pillar of the company's growth strategy.\n\nSkechers U.S.A., Inc.

        "content": "Sometimes we forget to put one foot in front of the other but most of the time when we go outside for a walk we put on a pair of shoes. You consumers buy lots of shoes and there are lots of shoe companies to look at as investment vehicles and this week we are taking a look at three names and one that has had some insider buying over the past few months.\n\nFirst up is Nike NKE which is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and supports a nice growth divergence with an A for growth and an F for value. As the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks Brian Bolan is always looking for stocks that are growers. The growth divergence, meaning a strong growth score and a weak value score tells him he is on the right path.\n\nBrian reviews the forward earnings multiple and growth prospects for Nike NKE at notes that it will have a CEO transition in the coming year and the potential for a new product launch or aggressive marketing spend should be a tailwind for the stock. That said, the stock trades at a 25x forward earnings multiple and recently posted 0.3% topline growth.\n\nA competitor to Nike NKE is On Holdings ONON which is also a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and also has the growth divergence that he loves to see. ONON trades at 38x forward earnings but has shown some solid growth in the most recent quarter with sales increasing 32.5% from they year ago period.\n\nFinally Brian takes a look at Skechers SKX which is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a B for Value and an A for Growth. SKX has a much smaller market capitalization than the other two stocks that were profiled and has a much better valuation. With a forward earnings multiple of 14.7x, SKX looks cheap in comparison to the other stocks. The same could be said for the price to book multiple as well with SKX trading at just about 2x book value while the other two trade much higher on price to book basis.\n\nSkechers SKX has seen some insider buying over the last several months and Brian talks about how insider selling happens all the time but insider buying is what investors should pay attention to. These are the people that are running the business in see in great detail what is really happening so when they invest their money into the stock it is often a great signal.\n\nInsider Trader is a service run by Tracey Ryniec and she looks for the best stocks that have insider buying and combine that with a solid Zacks Rank in order for investors to have the best opportunity for positive returns. Skechers SKX Happens to be in the portfolio which happens to own 11 other stocks as well.\n\nAs one of the trading services at Zacks Investment Research, insider trader gives you and nightly e-mail discussing the important topics of the broader market and also then commentary on any news or important events happening to any of the companies in the portfolio.

        "title": "Skechers U.S.A's (NYSE:SKX) earnings growth rate lags the 14% CAGR delivered to shareholders",
        "content": "It hasn't been the best quarter for Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 11% in that time. On the other hand the returns over the last half decade have not been bad. It's good to see the share price is up 89% in that time, better than its market return of 87%.\n\nSince the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.6%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Skechers U.S.A\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, Skechers U.S.A managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Skechers U.S.A's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nSkechers U.S.A shareholders are up 14% for the year. But that return falls short of the market. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 14% per year over five year. It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Skechers U.S.A is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nSkechers U.S.A is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "New Balance CEO details the 'next big revolution' in sneakers",
        "content": "New Balance is racing to bring the next innovative sneaker to consumers across categories, from street fashion to professional athletics.\n\nSteering the Boston-based company is a native son of the city, Joe Preston, who sees the privately held athletic sportswear brand breaking out of its \"dad shoe\" reputation by delivering products that are new, fresh, and authentic.\n\n\u201cWe do believe the next big revolution is going to come in materials,\" New Balance CEO told Yahoo Finance in a new episode of Lead This Way. \"I fundamentally believe that, and I think it\u2019ll come plant-based or something that will revolutionize the industry.\"\n\nPreston may not be a molecular biophysicist by trade, but he knows it takes scientific research to develop the top footwear.\n\nIn the company's research lab in Brighton, Mass., a robot pounds away at the latest test sample of a New Balance running shoe. Across the hall is a test room that features a dual-banded treadmill and over 20 wall-mounted motion sensor cameras to study prototypes. New Balance CEO Joe Preston takes a look at a FuelCell running shoe undergoing testing in the company's research lab. (Yahoo Finance Lead This Way)\n\nJoe and his team test how their shoes stand up against machine-simulated wear and tear. Then, they further evaluate the product in performance tests with real athletes.\n\nBut the journey to patenting innovation doesn\u2019t come without challenges from competitors. Last year, industry titan Nike (NKE) sued New Balance and Skechers (SKX), citing patent infringement of its Flyknit technology.\n\n\"Intellectual property is a key element of a company\u2019s assets, so we want to protect our assets,\" Preston said about the lawsuit. \"Likewise, if we feel companies are overstepping their bounds when they come after us, then we\u2019re going to defend ourselves.\"\n\nPreston's leadership style: 'Enable and facilitate'\n\nPreston is a first-generation American running a business that touches every corner of the world.\n\n\"My parents immigrated here in 1959,\" Preston said. \"I'm one of five children, and hard work, education were really drilled into me early on.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPreston started his career as a senior product manager at New Balance in 1995. In 2018, after 23 years at the company, he was promoted to president and CEO of the company.\n\nThe CEO credits part of his leadership style to the time he spent managing the brand overseas. In 2024, New Balance celebrated 35 years in Japan, and Preston personally made the trip for the occasion.\n\n\u201cI ran our international business for a long time, and that's where I learned that the role of a leader is to enable and facilitate, not audit and control,\" he said.

(Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images) (Mike Kemp via Getty Images)\n\nThe leader of global athletic wear brand has leaned on the international acuity he attained during his tenure to spur New Balance's next leg of growth. The sneaker maker reported $6.5 billion in annual sales in 2023. About a third of those sales were in the US, and two-thirds were from outside the US, according to Preston.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to be a global brand,\" Preston said. \"The top sellers are the top sellers everywhere, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is getting the information the same way, so you\u2019ve got to make sure those nuances are in place so that you can benefit.\u201d\n\nPreston anticipates New Balance will reach $10 billion in sales in the next few years, with a roadmap for that target coming later this year.\n\nRetro sneakers with new tricks\n\nThere's plenty of momentum behind the brand post-pandemic, as sneaker manufacturers witnessed a perfect storm of consumers looking to shop combined with a rush toward retro sneakers.\n\nNew Balance's 23% revenue growth between 2022 and 2023 outpaced that of Nike, Asics, and Puma. This all comes as the global sneaker market continues to grow and is projected to top $80 billion this year.\n\n\u201cIf you go back into our archives, ... you understand that these products that were introduced were state-of-the-art,\u201d Preston said about the retro shoe trend. \u201cThe 990 [released in 1982] was the first $100 running shoe, and there are multiple models in there that were worn by some of the best runners in the world.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s a discovery item,\" he added, \"and I think our designers do a great job of developing new product, and then taking some of our old classics and reimagining them. And the consumer is really gravitating toward it.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from online marketplace StockX, New Balance owned five of the top 16 retro and running silhouettes shoppers were obsessed with in 2023.\n\nAnd as if organic interest wasn\u2019t enough, an unexpected flash point for the brand occurred after pop icon Taylor Swift was seen sporting New Balance shoes to an NFL regular season game to support her beau Travis Kelce.

(Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports) (USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Connect / Reuters)\n\nIt also helps to have modern partnerships with world-renowned athletes. New Balance has struck sponsorships with tennis phenom Coco Gauff, fresh off a US Open Tennis win, Olympic gold medalist sprinter Sydney McLaughlin, who is ramping up for the 2024 Paris games, and baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani, who landed the largest contract in MLB history.\n\nFrom the perspective of the New Balance CEO, it\u2019s all proven beneficial in attaining new, youthful buyers.\n\n\u201cI definitely think it's helped us get the brand younger,\u201d Preston said. \u201cI think you want to find athletes that you believe share the same values that you have as an organization.\u201d Lead This Way\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Ugly shoes are here to stay: Ugg, Crocs thriving as consumers turn to comfort",
        "content": "Uggs to work, Crocs to parties, and Birkenstocks and socks all summer long.\n\nConsumers' desire to wear comfy shoes all day, everyday is taking priority and spreading across generations. The continued casualization of footwear is driving once-stale brands into the spotlight as their businesses reap increasing sales.\n\nIn a note to clients, Stifel analyst Jim Duffy highlighted a \"shift in retro trend evidenced by the meteoric rise of New Balance\u2019s chunky dad shoes ... as well as explosive popularity of the [Adidas] Samba, plus the Campus and Gazelle.\"\n\nBut, how did bulky \"dad shoes\" suddenly become a fashion staple?\n\nIt's the rising appeal to wear something that \"feels good on your feet,\" Duffy said to Yahoo Finance over the phone.\n\n\"Particularly with younger consumers, you're seeing a lot of them embrace comfort and prioritize that over fashion, or even represented as fashion,\" said Duffy.\n\nThe global comfort footwear market is expected to grow from $26.35 billion in 2023 to $47.37 billion in 2028. Now, top players like Nike and Adidas need to watch their backs for rising stars.\n\nThe typical American only buys about seven pairs of shoes per year, per Duffy, and Decker Outdoor (DECK), Crocs (CROX), Birkenstock (BIRK), and Skechers (SKX) are racing to earn their place in shoppers' closets.\n\n\"The bigger brands like Adidas and Nike have realized ... these companies are coming for us and they might be small today, but you blink your eyes and they could be a lot bigger,\" said Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic over the phone. Both brands need to re-focus on innovation and less on e-commerce sales, he added.\n\nCapitalizing on comfort\n\nBrands that have leaned into the pivot are showing results on their balance sheet. For the nine months ending in December 2023, Decker reported a 17% jump in revenue while its profit grew nearly 50% to $632 million. Crocs clocked a 47% bump to its profit for full-year 2023 and its sales went up 11%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrocs now anticipates revenue growth of 3% to 5% in fiscal 2024 compared to last year.\n\nInvestors have recently rewarded the companies, sending Decker's shares flying 29% year to date and 89% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 (^GSPC)'s gains by a landslide.\n\nTwo of Decker's comfiest brands, Ugg and Hoka, have been driving the bus on its growth. Its latest quarterly results show that Ugg sales increased 15%, reaching its first-ever $1 billion quarter, while revenue from Hoka jumped 22% to $429 million.\n\n\"Hoka remains our primary growth vehicle with considerable opportunity for both region and category expansion,\" CEO Dave Powers said on an earnings call.\n\nRemote workers who flocked to fuzzy slippers during the pandemic are deciding to stick with the style, even as life goes back to normal and they return to in-person work, UBS analyst Jay Sole told Yahoo Finance.\n\nDecker has also grown beyond its furry boots roots, expanding to slip-ons and even sneakers, reaching a \"younger\" and \"more diverse consumer,\" said Powers.\n\nAnd looser dress codes are becoming the norm everywhere, from offices to schools to malls.\n\n\"That more relaxed dress code applied to kids in school and kids going out in public as well,\" leading to that group \"continuing to wear other slippers, Ugg, or Crocs,\" Duffy said.\n\nThe competition is fierce. In Piper Sandler's latest consumer survey with teens, Crocs fell from the No. 7 to No. 6 brand in footwear \"mainly due to the popularity of UGG.\" Crocs also ranked as No. 3 for trends that could be \"on the way out\" with male teens. Birkenstock jumped on as the No. 10 favorite footwear brand among teenagers, while HeyDude clocked in at No.8.\n\nHowever, Deckers' stock could be getting too expensive after its rapid rise, warned Sole.\n\nCrocs, which has seen its stock shoot up roughly 37% this year, still has runway for growth, according to analysts.\n\nConcerns over its 2022 HeyDude acquisition has slowed Crocs' stock performance, with its shares dropping nearly 14%in 2023 before recovering this year.\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter report, the main Crocs brand surpassed $3 billion in sales, jumping 14% year over year.\n\n\"A lot of people who wouldn't have been caught dead wearing a pair of Crocs\" gave them a try during the shutdowns and are now returning due to their comfortability and price point. The company's focus on innovation, comfort, value, and personalization remain key components of its position, said Nikic.\n\nMeanwhile, HeyDude still needs to diversify its distribution and designs, with the brand currently offering only two models. The turnaround could take 18-plus months, according to Nikic.\n\n\"The stock itself is not overly expensive from a valuation perspective,\" he explained. \"The only reason why it's as cheap as it is, is because the HeyDude brand has been a little bit of a roller-coaster ride. If they can get HeyDude on the right track ... you've got a lot of upside potential in Crocs shares.\" Crocs are displayed on shelves in an exhibition hall. (Fabian Strauch/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nOther names that have been ridings this trend include Skechers and Birkenstock, which went public last October. Skechers CEO John Vandemore said at a recent conference that consumers' response to the shoes has been \"very positive.\"\n\nHowever, a challenging retail landscape has muted Skechers' stock return this year, while Birkenstock's lockup expiration in early April has contributed to its share price struggles.\n\nOverall, Decker, Crocs, Birkenstock, and Skechers \"are really well positioned to continue to deliver nice growth,\" said Sole, though their stocks could face ongoing pressure if concern around consumers' strength changes.\n\nCompanies that have missed out on consumers' willingness to spend on comfort include V.F. Corporation (VFC), parent of Vans and Timberland, and sneaker maker AllBirds (BIRD).\n\n\"Vans was the hottest brand in the world before COVID,\" said Nikic, but the company failed to introduce new products, losing customer interest in the process.\n\nAllbirds, on the other hand, has limited physical retail presence due to its online, direct-to-consumer model, making it difficult to continue expanding its customer base.\n\nBut comfy yet ugly footwear is here for the long haul. For one, while some think chunky running shoes and sandals with holes aren't the most stylish (looking at many of my colleagues), others take pride in their feel and looks.\n\nPlus, sharing how you feel about the shoes' appearance \u2014 whether you love 'em or hate 'em \u2014 actually makes those shoes more popular, per Jorge Barraza, a professor of consumer psychology at the University of Southern California.\n\nBeing seen as ugly can create a polarizing image that itself draws a fan following. People may like being contrarian and enjoy \"what is being signaled by wearing this brand versus not.\"\n\nMoreover, the desire to feel like walking on clouds is here to stay, so expect more slip-ons at the office and fewer dress shoes.\n\n\"The workplace has become a lot more business casual, or just purely casual,\" said Barraza.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Skechers U.S.A's (NYSE:SKX) stock up by 2.1% over the past week. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company\u2019s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Skechers U.S.A's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Skechers U.S.A\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Skechers U.S.A is:\n\n15% = US$650m \u00f7 US$4.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.15.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nSkechers U.S.A's Earnings Growth And 15% ROE\n\nTo start with, Skechers U.S.A's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for Skechers U.S.A's moderate 19% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Skechers U.S.A's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 11%.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is SKX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Skechers U.S.A Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nSkechers U.S.A doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Skechers U.S.A's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Skechers U.S.A fair value estimate is US$57.80 Current share price of US$60.91 suggests Skechers U.S.A is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for SKX is US$70.20, which is 21% above our fair value estimate\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Skechers U.S.A\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$356.7m US$578.6m US$725.3m US$718.0m US$553.0m US$551.7m US$554.6m US$560.5m US$568.5m US$578.0m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ -0.23% Est @ 0.52% Est @ 1.05% Est @ 1.43% Est @ 1.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8%  US$331 US$497 US$578 US$531 US$379 US$351 US$327 US$306 US$288 US$272\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.9b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.8%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$578m\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.8%\u2013 2.3%) = US$11b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$11b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$5.0b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$8.9b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$60.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Skechers U.S.A as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.208. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Skechers U.S.A\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for SKX.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "title": "Skechers U.S.A (NYSE:SKX) Is Reinvesting At Lower Rates Of Return",
        "content": "Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after investigating Skechers U.S.A (NYSE:SKX), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Skechers U.S.A is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.13 = US$785m \u00f7 (US$7.5b - US$1.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nSo, Skechers U.S.A has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Luxury industry average of 12%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Skechers U.S.A  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Skechers U.S.A's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Skechers U.S.A .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nIn terms of Skechers U.S.A's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 13% from 18% five years ago. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line On Skechers U.S.A's ROCE\n\nIn summary, Skechers U.S.A is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 92% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.\n\nOn a separate note, we've found  1 warning sign for Skechers U.S.A  you'll probably want to know about.\n\nWhile Skechers U.S.A isn't earning the highest return, check out this freelist of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "CROX, BIRK, SKX: Which Footwear Stock Can Run the Most?",
        "content": "As the tech trade begins to run out of steam, value-conscious investors may wish to reconsider some lower-cost mid-cap plays that still offer plenty of growth promise. At this juncture, the footwear scene looks quite interesting, with new and old combatants \u2014 think CROX, BIRK, and SKX \u2014 seeking to grab a greater share of a market ripe for disruption.\n\nThough the direct-to-consumer (DTC) trend has calmed in recent years, I view significant opportunity for the following iconic brands that seem to have a steady footing in the physical and digital realms. Therefore, let\u2019s check in with TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to see where analysts stand on the following mid-cap footwear firms and see if any can keep growing in this rocky consumer environment.\n\nCrox (NASDAQ:CROX)\n\nCrox is a pretty divisive piece of footwear. You either love it (for its comfort and customizability), or you hate it (for its seemingly strange, clunky appearance). Personally, I\u2019m no fan of the clog, but I do find the potential value proposition and the stock\u2019s newfound momentum intriguing. Combined with a Strong Buy rating from the analyst community and some remarkable chatter from some big-name analysts, I find it hard to be anything but bullish on the firm, especially as the American consumer looks to move on after a tough past few years.\n\nUndoubtedly, the pandemic boom is in the rear-view mirror. With return-to-office orders, workers may be inclined to ditch their Crox for a pair of fancy dress shoes or, at the very least, a pair of less-eye-grabbing sneakers. Unlike most other massive winners from the lockdown days of 2021, Crox is within striking distance of all-time highs, thanks in part to a remarkable 28% year-to-date gain on the back of a solid quarter.\n\nFor the quarter, Crox clocked in earnings per share of $2.58, ahead of the $2.37 estimate. Despite a challenged consumer climate, demand for the clogs and HEYDUDE (a lightweight shoe brand acquired a few years ago) stayed robust. Additionally, the company continues to excel with DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) sales. After the report, analyst firm Raymond James hiked its price target to $145.00 from $120.00, citing its \u201ccompelling drivers for durable growth.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nUndoubtedly, DTC opens up plenty of runway for the divisive clog. Like it or not, the management team is doing a lot of things right. And with a modest 9.37 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, Crox stock may very well be the \u201cGARPiest\u201d \u2014 GARP is an acronym for growth at a reasonable price \u2014 stock out there.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for CROX Stock?\n\nCrox stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 10 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average CROX stock price target of $133.00 implies 9.8% upside potential.\n\nBirkenstock (NYSE:BIRK)\n\nBirkenstocks are another \u201cugly\u201d piece of footwear that your average consumer either loves or hates. Despite going live on public markets just a few months ago, the German sandal maker is actually one of the oldest companies out there, having been founded all the way back in 1774. Undoubtedly, the firm has built its reputation for quality over the course of many centuries. That\u2019s the type of brand power you really can\u2019t buy.\n\nWith significant momentum behind shares and a compelling growth runway, I\u2019m inclined to be bullish on the stock despite its somewhat frothy multiple.\n\nFor now, BIRK stock seems to be a rather successful IPO, with the stock in an uptrend since it started trading back in October 2023. Like Crox, Birkenstock is making the most of the DTC opportunity at hand while also teaming up with selective wholesale partners. As the company continues deleveraging while garnering more brand momentum (product placement in the hit film Barbie showcased the sandal to young generations), Birkenstock seems like a freight train that\u2019ll be tough to stop.\n\nUndoubtedly, 40.6 times forward P/E is a high price to pay for a sandal maker. It\u2019s priced with growth in mind, although the company\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter (and first quarter as a public company) disappointed many, at least initially. However, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sleeping on the firm after clocking in 16% in sales growth. That\u2019s not just decent growth for an old-time sandal company; it looks to be sustainable growth that could pick up further once consumers are in a better spot.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for BIRK Stock?\n\nBirkenstock stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 10 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average BIRK stock price target of $52.30 implies 1.65% upside potential.\n\nSkechers (NYSE:SKX)\n\nFinally, we have Skechers, a $9.3 billion sneaker underdog that\u2019s actually starting to gain when it comes to the \u201ccool factor.\u201d Indeed, bringing on star athletes and tapping into the creative spirit of young students via its BOBS Design Scholarship contest seems to be making the brand more relevant among the new generations. Additionally, tougher times call for greater value, and there\u2019s arguably no better value option in the sneaker scene right now than Skechers.\n\nArguably, you\u2019re not \u201ctrading down\u201d at all by going for the lower-cost Skechers over the likes of its pricier rivals, given the latest and greatest Skechers shoes tend to have all of the same, if not better, comfort technologies under the hood (or should I say insole). All considered, I consider SKX stock to be a great value play as it continues firing on all cylinders, from DTC to efforts to bolster brand affinity. As such, I\u2019m staying bullish.\n\nAt around 7% off all-time highs, the recent dip seems more like a buying opportunity for investors willing to overlook past the latest quarterly wholesale slowdown en route to the long-term DTC growth opportunity at hand as the firm seeks to expand its global store count.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for SKX Stock?\n\nSkechers stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average SKX stock price target of $66.80 implies 9.7% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nDon\u2019t sleep on mid-cap footwear firms as they look to keep their growth going strong while pulling the DTC growth lever to make the most of their strong brands. Of the trio, analysts see the most year-ahead upside in CROX stock (9.8%) while seeing roughly the same amount of upside in SKX stock (9.7%).\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX), is not the largest company out there, but it led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Skechers U.S.A\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for Skechers U.S.A\n\nWhat Is Skechers U.S.A Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Skechers U.S.A seems to be fairly priced at around 8.71% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Skechers U.S.A today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $54.88, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Skechers U.S.A\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat does the future of Skechers U.S.A look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 76% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Skechers U.S.A. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SKX\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on SKX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Skechers U.S.A at this point in time. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Skechers U.S.A and we think they deserve your attention.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Skechers U.S.A, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "The Next Procter &amp; Gamble? 3 Consumer Stocks That Investors Shouldn\u2019t Ignore",
        "content": "You can take a list of consumer stocks that can be the \u201cnext Procter & Gamble\u201d in many different ways. Certain small- and mid-cap stocks may share some of PG\u2019s attributes. They are products that foster brand loyalty, offer pricing power and perhaps even pay a dividend.\n\nBut these companies will have to deliver share price growth. Since 1984, that\u2019s something that Procter & Gamble has done at a non-split adjusted average of over 130% in the last 40 years.\n\nThat kind of consistency is the definition of \u201cwhen in doubt, zoom out.\u201d Also, it shows a stock\u2019s development of a reputation for letting investors sleep soundly, regardless of market fluctuations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s still a tough task to find consumer stocks. But, among small- and mid-cap stocks showing healthy growth, three names stand out.\n\nWD40 (WDFC) a shelf stocked full of WD-40\n\nSource: Ismail Sadiron / Shutterstock.com\n\nWD40 (NYSE:WDFC) is part of the consumer staples sector since its products are always in demand.\n\nBut, the historical price chart for WDFC stock is up 2,432.39% since 1984. That averages out to a non-split adjusted 60% per year. WD40 delivered a 2-for-1 stock split in August 1997. Also, the company has a dividend that currently yields 1.35% and has been increasing for the last 15 years.\n\nIn October 2023, I placed WD40 on a list of overvalued stocks. Nothing has changed from a valuation standpoint. In fact, the company has a higher valuation based on its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. As of market close on February 13, 2024, WDFC checks in with a P/E ratio of 50.8x.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s average P/E over the last 10 years is around 37x. And many times in that span, the stock has traded at a P/E well above 40x.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s time to take a new position in WDFC stock. With short interest coming in around 13%, you may want to wait for a pullback. But if you currently own the stock, there\u2019s ample reason to believe that WD40 will continue to be one of the consumer stocks you shouldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nStory continues\n\nSkechers (SKX) sketchers show store. sleeper stocks\n\nSource: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkechers U.S.A. (NYSE:SKX) falls in the discretionary category of consumer stocks. The company has been publicly trading since 1999, and it shows some nice price action. The stock is averaging approximately 63% stock price growth per year.\n\nNotably, the company has made strides at upgrading its portfolio without losing its cache as a value brand to rivals such as Nike (NYSE:NKE). And, the company\u2019s footwear appeals to both affluent, aging Baby Boomers as well as Gen Z. That means the company isn\u2019t just a buy in a weak economy.\n\nAdditionally, Skechers checks the valuation box. At 17x forward earnings, the stock is currently trading below its historical average as well as the average of the broader consumer discretionary category.\n\nHowever, Skechers has some work to do in the dividend area before earning a title of \u201cnext Procter and Gamble.\u201d\u00a0Although no evidence exists that a dividend is coming, the company did undertake a $500 million share buyback in 2022.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last of the consumer stocks on my list of contenders for the next Procter & Gamble is e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF). The company fits into the consumer defensive category which I look at is either staples or discretionary depending on your point of view.\n\nInvestors buy stories, and e.l.f. Beauty has a strong one. The company is carving out a niche because its products are designed with vegan and cruelty-free ingredients. That resonates with its core demographic.\n\nIt\u2019s working. The company\u2019s revenue and earnings are up strongly year over year (YOY). At a time when many consumer stocks are having problems with growth, this is impressive. And, it shows up in the ELF stock price which is up 132% in the last year.\n\nThe stock has been trading publicly only since 2016, but it\u2019s already rewarding shareholders with an average gain of approximately 70% per year. And six weeks into 2024, the stock is impressively up 18%.\n\nInvestors pay a significant premium for the stock at 69x forward earnings. Plus, the early-stage growth company doesn\u2019t pay a dividend. Yet, with the company projecting 19.7% earnings growth in the next 12 months, this is one consumer stock to watch closely.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 12, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses NIKE Inc. NKE, Adidas AG ADDYY, Skechers SKX, Carter\u2019s Inc. CRI and Rocky Brands RCKY.\n\nIndustry: Shoes and Other Accessories\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2223847/5-shoes-retail-apparel-stocks-to-watch-amid-inflation-led-turmoils\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry has been dealing with hardships from elevated costs, disrupted supply chains, reduced spending trends on discretionary items and increased marketing investments. These headwinds have been the key burdens on the participating companies\u2019 profits. Additionally, adverse currency movements threaten industry players due to their worldwide presence.\n\nHowever, the industry continues to witness positive demand trends on increased consumer awareness about leading a healthy lifestyle, which has been aiding the demand for activewear and athletic shoes. New and innovative designs have been the key drivers for the industry participants. Players focused on product innovation, store expansion, digital investments and omni-channel growth are expected to gain. Investments in products and e-commerce portals bode well for players like NIKE Inc., Adidas AG, Skechers, Carter\u2019s Inc. and Rocky Brands.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry comprises companies that design, source and market clothing, footwear and accessories for men, women and children under various brand names. Product offerings of the companies mostly include athletic and casual footwear, fashion apparel and activewear, sports equipment, bags, balls, and other sports and fashion accessories.\n\nThe companies showcase their products through their branded outlets and websites. Some companies distribute products via other retail stores, such as national chains, online retailers, sporting goods stores, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Look at What's Shaping Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry's Future\n\nCost Headwinds: Companies in the industry are witnessing elevated costs due to factors like commodity cost inflation and reinvestments. Supply-chain constraints and elevated logistic costs have been acting as deterrents. Many companies expect increased logistic costs to hurt margins in the near term.\n\nElevated marketing expenses, higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses, and increased investments to enhance store and digital operations have been raising SG&A costs. Also, industry participants are witnessing rising costs to support brand campaigns and digital investments.\n\nThe exit from the Russia business due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict is likely to be the key concern for some players. A tough and competitive labor market is another headwind. These factors pose a threat to the industry players\u2019 margins.\n\nConsumer Demand Trends: Players in the industry have been benefiting from strong consumer demand for activewear/athleisure products and footwear. The trend is expected to continue in 2024. Athletic goods and apparel companies offer products from footwear, sweatshirts, leggings, pants, jackets and tops to yoga wear and running clothes for men and women.\n\nThe increasing focus on fashion is boosting the demand for innovative clothes and footwear in the United States. Industry participants have been focused on product innovations, active promotions, store expansion and enhancing e-commerce capabilities to gain market share. Favorable health and wellness trends have been the key to inspiring footwear manufacturers to expand their product portfolios.\n\nThe companies continue to innovate styles, materials and colors, and incorporate functional designs to grab a large share of the fast-growing market. Multi-functional shoes, which cater to casual and formal looks, have been gaining popularity.\n\nE-Commerce Investments: E-commerce has been playing a crucial role in the athleisure market\u2019s growth. The companies in the market segment are looking to build a customer base through websites, social media and other digital channels. As consumers continue to shop from home, growth of athletic-inspired apparel and digital sales are likely to continue.\n\nCompanies focused on expanding their athletic-based apparel lines and building on e-commerce capabilities are expected to witness growth in the long run. Efforts to accelerate deliveries through investments in supply chains and order fulfillment avenues are likely to provide an edge to industry players.\n\nSimultaneously, companies are investing in renovations and improved checkouts, as well as mobile point-of-sale capabilities, to make stores attractive. Efforts to enhance experiences through multiple channels are likely to contribute significantly to improving traffic and transactions in stores and online.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #180, which places it in the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull prospects for the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.\n\nIndustry vs. Sector\n\nThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry has underperformed the sector and the S&P 500 in the past year.\n\nStocks in the industry have collectively declined 16.7%. The Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite have rallied 5.5% and 22.6%, respectively.\n\nShoes and Retail Apparel Industry's Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), commonly used for valuing Consumer Discretionary stocks, the industry is currently trading at 23.87X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 20.74X and the sector\u2019s 17.77X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry traded as high as 37.75X and as low as 20.15X, with a median of 26.76X.\n\n5 Shoes & Retail Apparel Stocks to Watch\n\nCarter\u2019s: The company is the largest marketer of branded apparel and related products for babies and young children in North America. It has been gaining from a solid e-commerce business, driven by expanded omni-channel facilities like curbside pickup, same-day pickup, buy online and pickup at store, and ship from store. This, along with easy access to a broad array of online products when shopping in stores, bodes well. Carter\u2019s has been benefiting from improved price realization and gains from share repurchases.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRI\u2019s 2024 sales and earnings indicates growth of 2.6% and 7.4% respectively, from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.

Moreover, the company has been witnessing improved margins, driven by the recently implemented price increases and an improved channel mix.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADDYY\u2019s 2024 sales indicates growth of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.

The company\u2019s emphasis on new product lines, store remodeling projects, cost-containment efforts, inventory management and global distribution platform bodes well. SKX is focused on executing its long-term growth strategy, with a diverse assortment of innovative and comfortable products. This is expected to drive its top line in the near and long terms.\n\nSkechers is making strategic investments to improve infrastructure worldwide, primarily e-commerce platforms and distribution centers. The company\u2019s international business is a significant sales growth driver. SKX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 45.7%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the footwear company\u2019s 2024 sales and earnings indicates growth of 9.4% and 9.7%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figures. The consensus estimate for SKX\u2019s 2024 EPS has moved down 4.5% in the past seven days.

RCKY\u2019s notable brand portfolio includes Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, Lehigh, The Original Muck Boot Company, XTRATUF, Servus, NEOS and Ranger.

Rocky Brands has been witnessing robust demand for its portfolio of leading brands, which has been aiding its performance.\n\nRCKY is making strong progress on enhancing its distribution and fulfillment capabilities, along with lower expense levels, including reduced freight rates. This is likely to position it well in the near term.
