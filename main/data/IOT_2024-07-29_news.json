        "content": "Digital twins \u2014 a virtual replication of a real-world object, place, thing, or other material object \u2014 are increasingly gaining ground across multiple market sectors. While digital twins evoke metaverse-style imaginings, and the term certainly applies, we can also think of a digital twin as a means by which real-world systems and processes can be more easily measured, experimented upon and ultimately brought back into the material world once optimized.\n\nFor example, research shows that digital twins can help develop optimal inventory management systems that cut costs while ensuring product availability, improving railway maintenance processes and even modeling trading behavior on major stock exchanges. In other words, digital twins are just the next evolutionary step in leveraging the virtual world to draw insight applicable to the material one.\n\nThese digital twin stocks are at the forefront of this new and emerging tech \u2014 but their success isn\u2019t tied solely to the virtual world.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is easily a blue-chip leader among digital twin stocks (if such a new and emerging tech has blue-chip equivalents). Autodesk\u2019s major current contributor to digital twin development is in the architecture, engineering and construction space (AEC), which is already a core part of Autodesk\u2019s operational outlook and an easy foothold into the new development paradigm.\n\nAutodesk\u2019s digital twin platforms help developers and architects visualize and adjust planned infrastructure and buildings beyond just layout, materials and structural strength. Instead, Autodesk simulates a range of behaviors and potentialities, including actual day-to-day utilization, weather event scenarios, traffic effects and even security events.\n\nThe AEC sector\u2019s digital twins tech has already demonstrated improved facility energy efficiency, improved maintenance throughout a building\u2019s lifecycle and more as the industry advances toward \u201cConstruction 4.0,\u201d or a state of improved technology and connectivity that revolutionizes the AEC sector leveraging AI, machine learning, the Internet of Things \u2014 and digital twins, as Autodesk demonstrates.\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs the company\u2019s stock ticker implies, Samsara\u2019s (NYSE:IOT) operational efforts largely center on the Internet of Things (IoT). But, not only is the IoT a major component of wider digital twins development, but Samsara itself was an early entrant in the newly developing paradigm, as evidenced by a 2022 article when the phrase \u201cdigital twin\u201d meant little to industry outsiders.\n\nStory continues\n\nI\u2019ve looked before at Samsara\u2019s strength in fleet and transport connectivity that enables improved logistic management and safety, but digital twins are another opportunity to expand Samsara\u2019s transport-focused mission. The aforementioned 2022 article, written by a Samsara engineer, illustrates how digital twins can help improve fuel efficiency and preemptive fleet maintenance to keep more vehicles on the road longer while working more efficiently.\n\nSamsara has a unique entry point into digital twin management: the company\u2019s IoT infrastructure is a constant data stream detailing performance and a myriad of variables across the logistics and fleet management spectrum. These depths of data are key to digital twins modeling, making the new tech opportunities an easy spin-off from Samsara\u2019s existing stack.\n\nRolls-Royce (RYCEY) Rolls Royce (RYCEY) logo on the side of an Airbus A330.\n\nSource: Matheus Obst / Shutterstock.com\n\nSurprised to see Rolls-Royce (OTCMKTS:RYCEY) on a list of digital twins stocks? While digital twins may have some application in luxury automobiles, the truth is that Rolls-Royce (the stock) has nothing to do with Rolls-Royce (the automobile) after a 1998 spin-off. Instead, Rolls-Royce is a high-end defense and aerospace manufacturer creating advanced aircraft engines \u2014 and leveraging digital twins to do it.\n\nAs with the AEC industry, digital twins help Rolls-Royce better project maintenance and repair requirements rather than relying on running the numbers in a probability-based simulation like the Monte Carlo method. By instead creating a digital twin of their engines within cyberspace and the depths of existing performance and maintenance data, Rolls-Royce doesn\u2019t have to overemphasize edge cases as they do with probability-based functions; instead, management can create demanding stress tests virtually to assess engine function in circumstances likely never seen in real life, then walk maintenance schedules backward from there to determine optimal timelines.\n\nDigital twins are just one of many of Rolls-Royce\u2019s unique aerospace advancements, which include SWARM robots and 3D-printed engine components. These make Rolls-Royce a unique overseas digital twin stock that can improve your portfolio\u2019s international diversification.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 Robotics Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "Humans have enjoyed the fruits of automation for a long time, at least since the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century. We are now entering a more complex age that relies on both smarter machines and the management of data, making it an opportune time to consider robotics stocks to buy now.\n\nOn one hand, a machine is nothing without sense data, just as humans are crippled in their actions without eyesight. On the other hand, even if that sense data is there, it has to be effectively coordinated into a holistic system.\n\nUnderlying such a system is the Internet of Things (IoT). Its industrial component alone is poised for a 17.2% CAGR by 2032, while consumer IoT is set for a 12.7% CAGR by 2030. These companies are tightening the intersection between enhanced connectivity and robotics platforms.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArbe Robotics (ARBE) Photo of a man sitting in a self-driving vehicle on a city street.\n\nSource: Andrey_Popov/ShutterStock.com\n\nFor investors betting on the autonomous driving future, Arbe Robotics (NASDAQ:ARBE) should be considered as one of the key robotics stocks to buy now. Based in Israel, the company provides the necessary sense hardware for full self-driving (FSD) to be feasible.\n\nThis includes 4D imaging radar solutions with ultra-high resolution and 360-degree coverage as well as Phoenix imaging radar to rapidly detect hundreds of objects up to 300 meters away. These solutions are steadily being adopted in the trucking industry to pave the road for level 4 autonomous driving.\n\nMost recently on July 1st, the company announced that one of the top 10 OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) selected Arbe\u2019s chipset for 4D radar imaging. So far, the company expanded its reach to China, Germany and the United States.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights as of the June report, the radar sensor market size is heading for a CAGR of 17.8% by 2032. At the moment, ARBE trades for $2.34 per share. That is above the 52-week average of $2.09 but ARBE shares are still far below its all-time high of $14.79 in November 2021. In the last three months, ARBE stock is up 25%.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough there are nearly a dozen robotics surgery companies, such as Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), Stryker (NYSE:SYK) and Asensus (NYSEMKT:ASXC), it appears that Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) offers the most widely adopted platform with its da Vinci system. With a long track record of successful surgeries since 2000, the company is simply ahead of the game.\n\nConsidering all the factors that could go wrong in such delicate matters, ISRG stock has received the most traction. Intuitive\u2019s latest da Vinci 5 iteration makes for a fully integrated robotics surgery platform ready for mass deployment. The company improved the Force Feedback feature for a better sense of pull and push forces by the operator.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombined with improved ergonomics and high-resolution 3D imaging, da Vinci 5 boasts over 150 design innovations. Of course, this also includes future-proofing by giving it enough computing power to harness AI advances.\n\nIn the Q1 earnings call, the Californian company delivered $545 million net income compared to $355 million in the year-ago quarter. With an operating margin of 33.3%, this makes Intuitive Surgical a high-margin business.\n\nPresently priced at $438.01, ISRG stock is near its 52-week high of $449. Yet, just as is the case with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), this may just be the beginning of Intuitive Surgical\u2019s continued rise and dominance, making it one of the top robotics stocks to buy now.\n\nSamsara (IOT) 3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Should Consider\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile flashy humanoid robots catch the public\u2019s attention, automation at scale relies on data coordination between various sectors. This is the mission of Samsara (NYSE:IOT). The stock\u2019s ticker symbol is also the acronym for the Internet of Things (IoT), hinting at the company\u2019s goal to integrate data from multiple platforms into a unified platform experience.\n\nThe California firm supplies many industries with solutions for AI cameras, real-time GPS, continuous diagnostics, electrification, real-time tracking of trailers, remote visibility and training for its host of devices.\n\nIn other words, the rollout of physical robots will likely involve Samsara\u2019s coordination services in logistics and transportation. For fiscal Q1 2025, the company generated $280.7 million in revenue, 37% more than the year-ago quarter, while netting $23.7 million cash from operations. The company holds an accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion and total liabilities of $825.5 million.\n\nNonetheless, Samsara\u2019s price-to-book (PB) ratio of 22.81 suggests that investors are highly optimistic about IoT growth. After all, it has been a constant theme at the World Economic Forum.\n\nCurrently priced at $38.26, IOT stock is nearly double the 52-week low of $21.48 per share. The stock has gained 17% in value year-to-date. Nasdaq forecasts an average price target of $41.1 for IOT shares. A less optimistic target estimates the value at $36, aligning with the current price. Samsara\u2019s robust growth and strategic position in IoT and automation make it a compelling buy. It stands out as a top choice among robotics stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Hypergrowth Stocks to Buy and Hold for 50 Years",
        "content": "Predicting the future is a fool\u2019s errand. If you had asked me just five years ago what 2024 would look like, I would have gotten it laughably wrong. The world has changed at a dizzying pace over the last two decades, with the rise of smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence, and so much more. Paradigm-shifting events like the COVID-19 pandemic have humbled our collective prognosticating abilities.\n\nSo, looking out 50 years to 2074 seems downright quixotic. Will we have flying cars and robot butlers as 1950s futurists imagined? Probably not. But I believe we can still make some informed, if speculative, bets on which industries and companies could deliver hypergrowth if things break their way. Artificial intelligence, genomic medicine, and clean energy look poised to revolutionize the economy and our lives in the coming decades.\n\nOf course, any 50-year prediction will likely prove off the mark. But, I\u2019m willing to take some risks on high-upside growth stories. Because if the stars do align, the rewards could be astronomical. With that in mind, here are seven hypergrowth stocks to buy and hold until 2074:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJoby Aviation (JOBY) Smartphone with logo of American eVTOL company Joby Aviation on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nJoby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) is well-positioned to ride the megatrend of urban air mobility in the coming decades.\n\nIt recently completed a 523-mile flight with its hydrogen-electric aircraft. The company also continues to make steady progress on the regulatory front, becoming the first eVTOL maker to have its final airworthiness criteria published by the FAA.\n\nFinancially, Joby remains on solid footing with $924 million in cash and short-term investments as of Q1 2024. This cash should provide ample runway as the company ramps up manufacturing and prepares for commercial operations targeted for 2025. Joby Aviation cash\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnalysts are generally bullish on JOBY stock. The consensus rating is a \u201cmoderate buy\u201d with a 12-month average price target of $9, implying nearly 45% upside from current levels. Raymond James recently initiated coverage with an \u201coutperform\u201d rating, while Canaccord Genuity reiterated its \u201cbuy\u201d rating.\n\nSure, Joby is still in the pre-revenue stage and faces risks as it navigates uncharted skies. However, with strong partnerships like Toyota (NYSE:TM), Delta (NYSE:DAL), and the U.S. Air Force, I believe Joby has the right ingredients for long-term success. As the $1 trillion urban air mobility market takes flight in the coming years, Joby looks poised to be a prime beneficiary.\n\nStory continues\n\nCredo Technology (CRDO) Temperature-Taking Technology Isn't Even the Best Reason to Buy Remark Stock\n\nCredo Technology (NASDAQ:CRDO) is riding high on the AI and data center megatrends. I believe the company\u2019s focus on high-speed connectivity solutions positions it well to capitalize on the explosive growth in data and AI infrastructure.\n\nIn Q4 2024, Credo\u2019s revenue surged an impressive 89.4% year-over-year to $60.8 million, driven by strong demand from hyperscale customers deploying AI. Analysts are bullish, with a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating and an average price target of $29, although insiders have been selling shares recently. Credo\u2019s management expects AI-related revenue to double by the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nWith gross margins over 65% and a cash-rich balance sheet, I think Credo has the financial strength to keep investing in innovation. As long as the data boom persists, I believe Credo\u2019s growth story has legs. The stock has been volatile but rewarded investors with a 5% return over the past month. Of course, competition from giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a risk to watch. I\u2019m optimistic about Credo\u2019s prospects if the coming decades are driven by data.\n\nAtlassian (TEAM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Australian software company Atlassian Corporation (TEAM) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a leading provider of team collaboration and productivity software. I believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from several megatrends that should act as tailwinds for growth in the coming years. The rise of AI is a key one \u2013 Atlassian is already using AI to boost team productivity through features like predictive smart search and AI-powered writing assistance. The ongoing migration to the cloud is another massive opportunity, with Atlassian now a \u201ccloud-majority\u201d company with over 300,000 cloud customers.\n\nEnterprise service management is yet another area in which Atlassian has strong momentum. Its Jira Service Management product hit $600 million in annual revenue as large organizations increasingly standardize on Atlassian. Financially, the most recent quarter impressed, with $1.19 billion in revenue (up 30% YOY), 82% gross margins, and positive operating income. Atlassian also provided bullish medium-term guidance, targeting 20%+ revenue CAGR through FY27 while maintaining operating margins above 25%. The growth ahead is too good to ignore. Hypergrowth stocks: Atlassian estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe stock has pulled back significantly from its highs and is basically flat in the past year, but I suspect it may have bottomed out here. I see significant upside if the growth continues.\n\nDroneShield (DRSHF) A drone being used by soldiers.\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nDroneShield (OTCMKTS:DRSHF) provides drone detection and countermeasure solutions to militaries and other security-focused organizations worldwide. I believe the company is poised for significant growth as the proliferation of drones in warfare and other domains is driving exponential demand for effective counter-drone technologies.\n\nDroneShield\u2019s financial performance has been nothing short of impressive. In Q1 FY2024, the company reported a staggering 900% year-over-year increase in revenues, reaching 16.4 million AUD. This growth was fueled by major contract wins, including a 5.7 million AUD repeat order from a U.S. government customer and a landmark counter-drone procurement agreement with NATO.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on DroneShield\u2019s prospects. Bell Potter rates the stock a buy with a forecast of 97 million AUD in sales and 24.4 million AUD in earnings for FY2024. CEO Oleg Vornik\u2019s recent comments suggest even greater ambitions, hinting at the potential for annual revenues to reach 500 million AUD.\n\nI believe DroneShield is well-positioned to capitalize on these megatrends and deliver substantial returns for investors. While the stock has already seen impressive gains (up 767.65% in the past year), I think there\u2019s still plenty of room for growth.\n\nSamsara (IOT) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSamsara (NYSE:IOT) provides software and insights for physical operations through its Connected Operations Cloud. The company is riding several megatrends that I believe position it well for continued hypergrowth. First, the increasing digitization of physical operations across industries like transportation and manufacturing is driving strong demand for Samsara\u2019s platform. Second, the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) could accelerate in the coming years as interest rates come down.\n\nSamsara delivered 37% revenue growth to $281 million in Q1 while also achieving record gross margins of 77%. Large enterprise customers grew 43% as Samsara became a strategic partner for digitizing complex operations. Analysts remain bullish, with RBC Capital reiterating an Outperform rating and $47 price target. The stock has surged 23% in the past month alone.\n\nWhile Samsara\u2019s platform extends well beyond EVs, I\u2019m optimistic the company will benefit as high-growth tech stocks roar back. With a massive $20 billion market cap already, Samsara still has a long runway ahead in my view. The company\u2019s ability to deliver fast ROI and billions in customer savings makes it a compelling investment for the years and even decades to come. Of course, competition is fierce, and execution is key, but I believe the stars are aligning for Samsara.\n\nCloudflare (NET) In this photo illustration a Cloudflare Inc (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) is a leading content delivery network and cloud security company that helps power and protect a huge portion of the internet. I\u2019d bet that most of the websites I visit on a daily basis rely on Cloudflare\u2019s services in some way, even if it\u2019s not obvious. This company has quietly become the backbone of the modern web.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Cloudflare posted strong results, with revenue growing 30% year-over-year to $378.6 million. Large customer growth was particularly impressive, as Cloudflare added a record number of customers spending over $100,000, $500,000, and $1 million annually. Operating margins also expanded.\n\nCloudflare is riding several powerful tailwinds that should continue propelling its growth. The ongoing shift to the cloud, the rise of edge computing, and the ever-increasing importance of cybersecurity are all megatrends playing right into Cloudflare\u2019s strengths. As more companies digitize their operations and more data moves online, the demand for Cloudflare\u2019s web performance and security solutions will only increase.\n\nCEO Matthew Prince recently unloaded over $12.9 million worth of stock. However, this is likely for personal financial reasons and doesn\u2019t change the company\u2019s fundamental story. With Cloudflare powering 80.6% of websites in some form, its market dominance is unquestionable. As long as the internet keeps growing, Cloudflare should keep winning.\n\nSemrush Holdings (SEMR) A concept image of a person holding a phone with various icons representing software-as-a-service companies. SaaS stocks.\n\nSource: TierneyMJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemrush Holdings (NYSE:SEMR) provides an online visibility management SaaS platform used by marketers for SEO, PPC, content, social media, and competitive research. I believe Semrush is well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of the digital marketing software market, which is expected to reach $264 billion by 2030. As businesses increasingly rely on search engine traffic to drive revenue, tools like Semrush that optimize online visibility are becoming mission-critical.\n\nSemrush delivered impressive results in Q1 2024, with revenue up 21% year-over-year to $85.8 million. The company is firing on all cylinders \u2013 paying customers increased to nearly 112,000, while its free active user base surpassed 1 million for the first time. Importantly, Semrush achieved strong profitability, reporting income from operations of $1.5 million and generating a free cash flow of $12 million.\n\nLooking ahead, I\u2019m very bullish on Semrush\u2019s growth prospects. The company is making smart investments in AI-powered tools like Content Shake and expanding upmarket with its new enterprise SEO product. This should drive further ARPU expansion, as enterprise contracts carry 10-15x higher values than Semrush\u2019s current average. With secular tailwinds at its back and a large market opportunity ahead, analysts are overwhelmingly positive on the stock, with a consensus price target of $15.90 implying nearly 18% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Samsara\u2019s chief product officer, Kiren Sekar, at Samsara Beyond 2024 in Chicago. (Photo: Samsara)\n\nAt Samsara\u2019s annual customer event, the telematics solutions provider showcased its commitment to driving technological innovation in operations and transportation through close partnerships with its users.\n\nWith over 2,000 attendees, Samsara Beyond highlighted the company\u2019s focus on developing practical solutions to real-world challenges faced by fleet operators, drivers and workers across industries.\n\nIn an interview with FreightWaves, Samsara\u2019s chief product officer, Kiren Sekar, emphasized the company\u2019s customer-first approach.\n\n\u201cWe always start with the customers, and we prioritize spending a lot of time directly with customers at events like this, but also getting out in the field, seeing their operations, spending time with their drivers, their workers, their back-office teams, and understanding the problems that they\u2019re having,\u201d said Sekar.\n\nThis engagement allows Samsara to identify pain points and develop targeted solutions. As Sekar noted, his team often builds prototypes for specific customer needs that end up driving enterprise solutions for all customers years later.\n\n\u201c[Those prototypes] might be a few years away from being primed for customers, but then we\u2019ll go invest and build out those solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother key focus for Samsara is improving driver safety through technology-enabled coaching.\n\n\u201cWe found that using data to identify the areas where a driver can reduce their risk, and then making that something that\u2019s not going to punish the driver but putting it in their hands and saying, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s how you can improve,\u2019 is really where we see the change and impact,\u201d Sekar explained.\n\nThis approach has yielded impressive results, with customers like DHL reportedly cutting accident costs in half.\n\nBeyond the numbers, the human impact is what resonates most. As the CPO shared, \u201cTo me, the [moments] that are most memorable include getting a note from an actual driver saying, \u2018Hey, this saved my life.\u2019\u201d\n\nMoving the industry forward\n\nSamsara recognizes that technology adoption in traditional industries can be challenging.\n\n\u201cTechnology is only half of the solution. The change management, the adoption, is just as important,\u201d Sekar told FreightWaves.\n\nTo tackle this, Samsara focuses on long-term partnerships with customers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t just send them a product and move on to the next thing. We really focus on these long-term engagements,\u201d Sekar explained.\n\nSamsara is also pushing the boundaries of asset tracking with its new product, the Asset Tag. This innovative approach takes advantage of the network of millions of Samsara gateways that are connected across customer vehicles, trailers and powered equipment.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated: Samsara releases Asset Tag at Beyond\n\n\u201cIt allows customers to connect any type of asset to Samsara, especially types of assets that would have been impractical to track with a cellular-based device,\u201d said Sekar.\n\nLooking to the future, Samsara is exploring cutting-edge technologies like satellite connectivity through a partnership with the Hubble Network. Sekar shared that Hubble will enable connectivity to Bluetooth devices from satellites in space. This could provide real-time coverage in all the places where there are not cellular devices or cellular connectivity.\n\nUltimately, Sekar said Samsara\u2019s vision is clear: \u201cOperators have seen firsthand how impactful data and technology can be in their operations, and they\u2019re hungry to digitize more and more and more.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s focus for the year ahead is providing that digitization and working with customers and partners closely to uncover those solutions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about using new technologies like artificial intelligence to find the insights from that data. \u2026 and then through really simple, easy-to-use, elegant software, they can take action on that data and those insights.\u201d\n\nArticles by Grace Sharkey\n\nSamsara Beyond lets industry stakeholders share best practices on data usage\n\nBorderlands Mexico: Samsara opens new office to focus on expanding cross-border trade\n\nSamsara adds app tools to keep drivers safe and compliant\n\nThe post Samsara\u2019s product strategy: Innovation through partnership appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Internet of Things (IoT), while technically made up of physical devices, is a somewhat abstract concept. If the term had been coined today, people would probably just call it artificial intelligence (AI) for gadgets. The IoT is composed of physical objects that use software, sensors and other technology to connect via the internet to other devices with the intention of making them all more useful or efficient. IoT devices can include household objects, industrial tools, vehicles and appliances and are commonly called \u201csmart objects.\u201d\u00a0The IoT enhances efficiency across industries, making IoT stocks to buy a great area to focus on if you want to diversify your portfolio with long term growth opportunities.\n\nMany household items, from thermostats to ovens are already commonplace in the IoT, but there are more applications for this technology in a wide variety of sectors. IoT is transforming industries like healthcare, transportation and agriculture as well. As more companies leverage IoT to innovate and streamline operations, we see more examples of IoT stocks to buy. Capitalizing on this technological advancement won\u2019t just enhance our future, but could also enhance the profitability of companies who embrace it.\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe first on this list of IoT stocks actually trades under the ticker symbol IOT. Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is a leader in industrial IoT technology and its customers include the world\u2019s largest organizations across construction, transportation, warehousing, field services, manufacturing, retail, logistics and the public sector. Its technology can make huge impacts on efficiency and cost effectiveness for the companies who utilize it. Thanks to Samsara, Summit Materials decreased preventable accidents by 33% and Liberty Energy expects to save $10 million.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRecently, the price of IOT dropped even though Samsara\u2019s Q1 results beat analysts\u2019 expectations. Year-to-date (YTD) the stock is down 6%, but it\u2019s up 12% in the last 12 months. But that is exactly why this is a great time to buy IOT. With the future expected to be bright for Samsara based on their current results and updated expectations, it\u2019s time to buy the dip.\n\nRevenue was up 37.4% year-over-year (YOY) to $280.7 million which beat analyst estimates of $272.4 million. Free cash flow (FCF) came in at $18.61 million, up from -$43.97 million in the previous quarter. These strong results caused Samsara to raise its outlook for the rest of the year. The company now anticipates revenue in the range of $1.209 at the midpoint versus $1.191 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) should come in between 13 cents and 15 cents, up from a previous estimate of 11 cents to 13 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohnson Controls (JCI) A sign for a Johnson Controls location showing the logo and address of the company.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2020, Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) was named \u201cOverall IoT Company of the Year\u201d from IoT Breakthrough, a leading market intelligence organization. JCI is up over 65% since then and, though it remained relatively flat over the last 12 months, it is now up 18% YTD. Johnson Controls is a multinational company that produces fire, HVAC and security equipment for buildings.\n\nIt specializes in intelligent buildings and sustainable energy solutions. The latter will become even more important as the interest in air conditioning surges as global temperatures continue to rise. Johnson Controls holds a unique position within the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) industry, and that sector is experiencing high growth driven by energy efficiency and data center cooling demand. Experts project a 7.4% annual increase in global air conditioning spending through 2030.\n\nJCI stock currently looks undervalued. It also offers a 2.18% annual dividend and has consistently increased its dividend over the past decade, making it a great option for income investors who want to put money into IoT stocks.\n\nCisco (CSCO) A Cisco (CSCO) sign outside of a building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA well known name since the 90s, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), had a somewhat fraught past five years, down 13% in that time. But new plans at the company may put it on the precipice of a turnaround. Tipranks believes there could be a 15% upside, and if the high end estimate of $70 holds true, CSCO could soon be trading close to an all time high it hasn\u2019t seen since 2000.\n\nCisco is branching out into AI, making a strategic $1 billion dollar investment in AI startups like Cohere, Mistral AI and Scale AI. It is also developing its ThousandEyes system designed to enhance internet functionality by helping traffic find the smoothest and fastest paths between users and servers. Additionally, Cisco is expanding its business into the electric vehicle (EV) sector in China. China\u2019s EV market is experiencing rapid growth, and Cisco actively partners with more than 10 electric car companies, providing technology and infrastructure as they build factories, offices and research and development centers.\n\nWith all these new undertakings, plus other plans in the pipeline, Cisco deserves much more investor love than it\u2019s getting currently. With a 3.36% annual dividend and great growth potential, CSCO looks like a strong IoT stock pick for both income and growth investors.\n\nOn\u00a0the\u00a0date\u00a0of publication, Philippa Main\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in\u00a0this\u00a0article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in\u00a0this\u00a0article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nPhilippa Main is a real estate agent in Virginia and Florida who also does freelance writing, editing, and business development and marketing.

        "content": "Samsara's Asset Tag (Photo: Business Wire) (Photo: Business Wire) (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nFirst of its kind IoT device powered by Samsara Network enables powerful location tracking to protect assets and reduce costs\n\nCHICAGO, June 27, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, at its Beyond conference, Samsara Inc. (\"Samsara\") (NYSE: IOT) announced the industry\u2019s first enterprise-grade Asset Tag designed to meet customer demand for tracking and managing small, high-value assets. This new device leverages the Samsara Network to offer increased visibility into the location of mission-critical equipment and tools. As a result, organizations can minimize downtime spent searching for lost or stolen items, reduce associated costs, and simplify inventory management.\n\nThe industries that power our global economy \u2013 like transportation, oil and gas, and construction \u2013 have complex operations that rely on specialized assets to get their work done each day. These assets include toolboxes, jackhammers, chemical totes, and more. Due to manual inventory processes and a lack of connected systems, the recurring loss or theft of these materials can cost organizations millions of dollars every year.\n\nBut as sensors get more compact, sophisticated, and easier to install, they can track anything \u2013 big or small. Samsara\u2019s Asset Tag was built around this opportunity: to provide unprecedented access and visibility into valuable assets at scale. By connecting critical assets to the cloud for the first time, customers can now easily capture and analyze location insights to significantly improve operational efficiency.\n\nThe Pike Corporation is a leading provider of infrastructure solutions for electric and gas utility companies within the United States. They use the Samsara platform across Vehicle Telematics, Video-Based Safety, and Asset Tracking to connect their operations. Most recently, Pike has begun testing Samsara\u2019s Asset Tag to help recover misplaced or lost tools and equipment and accurately track safety PPE to comply with annual OSHA testing requirements.\n\n\"We have several high-value assets like service gloves and electrical grounds that don\u2019t have serial numbers, but still need to be tracked, managed, and inspected to remain compliant,\" said James Banner, Senior Vice President of Administration at Pike Electric. \"Previously misplaced equipment would take us weeks to locate and if lost entirely, cost up to a million dollars to replace annually. With Samsara\u2019s Asset Tags, we are hoping to minimize this downtime, cut costs, and digitize manual inspection processes \u2013 all while keeping our employees safe and efficient. We\u2019re just getting started with this technology and I look forward to seeing what else it can do.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the Samsara Asset Tag, organizations can expect to:\n\nPrevent loss and recover stolen assets: with advanced location tracking technology powered by Samsara\u2019s vast network of gateways. Reduce downtime and boost productivity: by sharing asset locations with technicians in the field via the Samsara Driver App and avoid service disruptions with Inventory Filtering, which pulls a summary of assets and applies filters to identify which tools are in close proximity. Better manage inventory: and increase operational efficiency with a consolidated dashboard and easy-to-use reporting.\n\nPowerful location tracking capabilities within the Asset Tag are enabled by the Samsara Network, made up of millions of IoT devices worldwide.

We are proud to partner with our customers to help them operate smarter.\"\n\nServing tens of thousands of organizations across North America and Europe, the scale of Samsara\u2019s Connected Operations\u2122 Cloud is already contributing to dramatic improvements for customers and the communities they serve. In one year alone, Samsara has helped prevent over 200,000 crashes, digitized 230 million workflows, and reduced 3 billion pounds of CO2 emissions. Today, Samsara announced new innovations that further connect every aspect of physical operations and fuel AI-powered insights to drive tangible results.\n\nCreate better, safer jobs for frontline workers\n\nSamsara\u2019s customer feedback loop has allowed the company to maintain a rapid pace of innovation and iterate to meet changing customer needs. Samsara has already launched several safety products to create better, safer jobs for frontline workers. These include Virtual Coach, which helps drivers self-coach in the field, and new AI detections currently rolling out to customers for Drowsiness, Forward Collisions, and Lane Departures, which alert drivers of risky behavior in the moment.\n\nNow, Samsara has launched new solutions to further this commitment to safety and efficiency:\n\nConnected Training: Despite being one of the most dangerous industries with millions of injuries each year, the transportation sector lacks modernized training methods that are customized and adaptable for their unique work environments. With Connected Training, customers can have a data-driven training experience designed for continuous, remote learning via the Samsara Driver App. Managers can upskill their workforce by consolidating all training within the Samsara platform and connecting with existing workflows for a seamless employee experience.

AI\u2019s potential to revolutionize industries is immense. It\u2019s not just about automation or efficiency; AI promises to unlock new frontiers of creativity and intelligence that we\u2019re only beginning to explore.\n\nAI stocks represent a compelling opportunity for investors aiming to build generational wealth in a market that\u2019s increasingly looking forward. These companies are at the forefront of a technology wave that could define the next century, making them potentially lucrative investments for those looking to contribute to their grandchildren\u2019s financial security.\n\nWhile the buzz around AI has caused some stocks to soar to high valuations, hidden gems remain that can generate high returns in the long term. Hence, three AI stocks for long term growth that can deliver outsized returns in the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUpstart (UPST) Graphic of front profile of artificial face in pinkish-red hue with binary code and symbols surrounding it, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/local_doctor\n\nUpstart (NASDAQ:UPST) is known for its revolutionary AI lending model. The company has faced significant fluctuation in its stock price influenced by the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policies.\n\nIn early 2022, Upstart\u2019s revenues soared, with quarterly revenues exceeding $300 million and loan origination volumes reaching $4.5 billion. However, the landscape shifted dramatically by 2023, with FED continuing to hike rates and the loan market facing a decline.\n\nDespite the current challenges, the company has maintained a bullish outlook with the potential for rate cuts anticipated to reinvigorate the personal loan market. This optimism is underpinned by the total outstanding consumer credit nearing $5 trillion, suggesting a vast market potential for Upstart\u2019s innovative lending solutions.\n\nUpstart\u2019s growth strategy includes expanding its partnership network, which grew from 10 partners at its IPO to about 100 by early 2024. This expansion enhances its market reach and underpins its revenue generation capabilities. Furthermore, Upstart\u2019s commitment to AI and technology innovation remains strong, maintaining its competitive edge in fintech.\n\nLemonade (LMND) AI stocks to Buy, Close-up of letters \"AI\" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks. ai chip stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\n\nLemonade (NYSE:LMND) is making significant strides in revolutionizing insurance through advanced AI and customer-centric solutions.

Moreover, Lemonade reported revenue of $119.1 million, surpassing analyst expectations by about 5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s AI-driven platforms, such as Blender, have been instrumental in significantly reducing the Loss Adjustment Expense (LAE) ratio \u2014 from 13.2% to 7.6%.\n\nLemonade\u2019s expansion into the European market and adding new product lines, such as auto insurance, signify its strategic intent to diversify and tap into new revenue streams. The company\u2019s growth in Europe, which has launched in multiple countries, reflects its ability to scale internationally despite the challenges.\n\nSamsara (IOT) Purple and blue graphic of brain over top of data center, smartphone, laptop and various other tech, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Nadya C\n\nSamsara (NYSE:IOT) is a leading provider of Internet of Things solutions.

All organizations using AI report they have experienced benefits, including improved safety (45%) and employee productivity (42%). Of those already using AI, 90% say their employees feel positively about it.

(\"Samsara\") (NYSE: IOT), the pioneer of the Connected Operations\u2122 Cloud, today announced its latest State of Connected Operations Report \u2014 Smarter, Faster, Safer: The AI Revolution in Physical Operations \u2014 providing insights into how the organizations that drive more than 40% of the global GDP are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance safety, maximize efficiency, and empower their employees. With perspectives from more than 1,500 physical operations leaders across seven countries, the report reveals how AI is already revolutionizing how these organizations operate \u2014 and how leaders are transforming their operations and unlocking new efficiencies. This original research found that 94% of operations leaders surveyed believe their organization needs to invest in AI technology solutions to keep up in today\u2019s environment.\n\n\"AI is everywhere, and physical operations leaders are quickly embracing it,\" said Evan Welbourne, Head of AI and Data at Samsara. \"When used strategically, advances in AI can bring meaningful change to the companies that power our global economy. For example, it can reduce costs, boost efficiency, and even save workers' lives in the field.\"\n\nAI investment is on the rise.\n\nWhile some industries are slower to adopt AI, organizations within physical operations are embracing it, viewing it as a market-tested technology whose utility is proven and expanding. Nearly all (94%) leaders believe AI technology is vital to keep up, and 87% of organizations say they plan to increase investments in AI within the next 12 months. With continued pressures around labor shortages, geopolitical conflicts, and reshoring, technology will be key as organizations face these challenges.\n\nThe use of AI is growing in physical operations \u2014 and employees see that as a good thing.\n\nAI is not seen just as an experimental technology for the industries that keep the global economy running smoothly. More than half (51%) of leaders surveyed say their organization is already using AI, and reported benefits include improved safety (45%) and employee productivity (42%). Leadership roles are not the only ones within these organizations that are bullish on AI \u2014 90% of those already using AI say their employees feel positive about it. This may be because workers are seeing the direct benefit these solutions have on their day-to-day lives through enhanced workplace safety and efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecurity and data privacy come first.\n\nIt takes massive amounts of data to train AI models, representing a huge responsibility \u2014 and risk \u2014 for any organization. Physical operations leaders are not cutting corners. Of those already using AI or planning to in the next 1-2 years, 58% are implementing privacy and data protection measures. For the 63% of organizations that plan to adopt AI solutions created by external technology partners, security is not to be sacrificed for functionality. 52% of leaders said they care most about a partner\u2019s ability to integrate with existing systems, with security and privacy compliance (51%) also ranking high.\n\n\"Not all AI solutions are created equal,\" says Welbourne. \"You have to be able to trust the system, and that means finding a technology partner who not only has a proven track record with responsible innovation, but who also deeply understands your business and the challenges you\u2019re up against.\"\n\nTo view all insights from the State of Connected Operations Report \u2014 and discover how operations leaders are embedding AI into their organizations \u2014 visit http://samsara.com/resources/state-of-connected-operations-ai.\n\nAbout the Research\n\nThis survey was conducted by an independent research firm, Wakefield Research, between April 5 and April 14, 2024. 1,550 operations leaders were surveyed across seven countries: the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, and Canada.

However, its growth did slow down compared to last quarter as the company's revenue increased by just $4.45 million in Q1 compared to $38.74 million in Q4 CY2023. While we'd like to see revenue increase by a greater amount each quarter, a one-off fluctuation is usually not concerning.\n\nNext quarter's guidance suggests that Samsara is expecting revenue to grow 31.8% year on year to $289 million, slowing down from the 42.8% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 24.9% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. Samsara's free cash flow came in at $18.61 million in Q1, up 134% year on year. Samsara Free Cash Flow\n\nSamsara has burned through $12.12 million of cash over the last 12 months, resulting in a negative 1.2% free cash flow margin. This low FCF margin stems from Samsara's constant need to reinvest in its business to stay competitive.\n\nKey Takeaways from Samsara's Q1 Results\n\nSamsara had a fantastic \"beat and raise\" quarter. In layman's terms, it topped analysts' revenue and EPS expectations for this quarter and exceeded their revenue and EPS estimates for the full year. Shareholders should feel optimistic about these results. Given its high valuation and the recent run-up in its stock price over the last few days, however, the market was likely expecting more. The stock is down 6.2% after reporting and currently trades at $32.65 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Samsara right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

(NYSE: IOT), the pioneer of the Connected Operations Cloud, reported financial results for the first quarter ended May 4, 2024, and released a shareholder letter accessible from the Samsara investor relations website at investors.samsara.com.\n\n\"We delivered a strong first quarter of the new fiscal year with Q1 revenue of $280.7 million, growing 37% year-over-year, the same year-over-year adjusted revenue growth (1) as last quarter at a larger scale,\" said Sanjit Biswas, CEO and co-founder of Samsara. \"As the strategic partner to the world\u2019s leading and most complex physical operations organizations, we are focused on delivering clear and fast ROI for our customers and improving their operations.\"\n\nFirst Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Highlights\n\n(In millions, except percentage, percentage points, and per share data)\n\nQ1 FY2025 Q1 FY2024 Y/Y Change Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) $ 1,175.7 $ 856.2 37 % Total revenue $ 280.7 $ 204.3 37 % GAAP gross profit $ 212.1 $ 146.8 $ 65.3 GAAP gross margin 76 % 72 % 4 pts Non-GAAP gross profit $ 215.9 $ 149.7 $ 66.2 Non-GAAP gross margin 77 % 73 % 4 pts GAAP operating loss $ (66.0 ) $ (75.8 ) $ 9.8 GAAP operating margin (24 %) (37 %) 14 pts Non-GAAP operating income (loss) $ 6.2 $ (19.0 ) $ 25.2 Non-GAAP operating margin 2 % (9 %) 12 pts GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.10 ) $ (0.13 ) $ 0.03 Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted $ 0.03 $ (0.02 ) $ 0.05 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 23.7 $ 10.5 $ 13.2 Net cash provided by operating activities margin 8 % 5 % 3 pts Adjusted free cash flow $ 18.6 $ (2.2 ) $ 20.8 Adjusted free cash flow margin 7 % (1 %) 8 pts\n\n__________\r\nNote: Numbers are rounded for presentation purposes. (1) Q4 FY24 was a 14-week fiscal quarter instead of a typical 13-week fiscal quarter. To enable comparability across periods, adjusted revenue and adjusted revenue growth rate are calculated by multiplying Q4 FY24 revenue by 13/14 to remove the impact of an additional week of revenue recognition in Q4 FY24.\n\nWe report non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). See the section titled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures and the tables in the section titled \"Reconciliation Between GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial Outlook\n\nOur guidance includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For the second quarter and fiscal year 2025, Samsara expects the following:\n\nQ2 FY2025 Outlook FY 2025 Outlook Total revenue $288 million \u2013 $290 million $1.205 billion \u2013 $1.213 billion Year/Year revenue growth 31% \u2013 32% 29% Year/Year adjusted revenue growth (1) 31% \u2013 32% Non-GAAP operating margin (2%) 3% Non-GAAP net income per share, diluted $0.00 \u2013 $0.01 $0.13 \u2013 $0.15\n\n__________ (1) Q4 FY24 was a 14-week fiscal quarter instead of a typical 13-week fiscal quarter. To enable comparability across periods, adjusted revenue and adjusted revenue growth rate are calculated by multiplying Q4 FY24 revenue by 13/14 to remove the impact of an additional week of revenue recognition in Q4 FY24.\n\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance financial measures to corresponding GAAP guidance financial measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and potential variability of expenses, such as stock-based compensation expense-related charges, that may be incurred in the future and cannot be reasonably determined or predicted at this time. It is important to note that these factors could be material to our results of operations computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAbout Samsara\n\nSamsara is the pioneer of the Connected Operations\u2122 Cloud, which is a system of record that enables businesses that depend on physical operations to harness Internet of Things (IoT) data to develop actionable insights and improve their operations.

These statements may relate to, but are not limited to, expectations of future operating results or financial performance, the calculation of certain of our key financial and operating metrics, our market opportunity, industry developments and trends, customer demand for our solution, macroeconomic conditions and any expected benefits of our products, and our competitive position, as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing.\n\nForward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and could cause actual results and events to differ. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"contemplate,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"goal,\" \"guidance,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"objective,\" \"ongoing,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"seek,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" or the negative of these terms or other comparable expressions that concern our expectations, strategies, plans, or intentions. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved, if at all. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made, including information furnished to us by third parties that we have not independently verified, and/or management\u2019s good faith beliefs and assumptions as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this press release may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\n\nThese risks and uncertainties include our ability to retain customers and expand the Applications used by our customers, our ability to attract new customers, our future financial performance, including trends in revenue and annual recurring revenue, net retention rate, costs of revenue, gross profit or gross margin, operating expenses, customer counts, non-GAAP financial measures (such as adjusted revenue, adjusted revenue growth rate, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, free cash flow margin, and adjusted free cash flow margin), our ability to achieve or maintain profitability, the demand for our products or for solutions for connected operations in general, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, geopolitical tensions involving China, the conflict in Israel and Gaza, the emergence of pandemics and epidemics, and macroeconomic conditions globally on our and our customers\u2019, partners\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 operations and future financial performance, possible harm caused by silicon component shortages and other supply chain constraints, the length of our sales cycles, possible harm caused by a security breach or other incident affecting our or our customers\u2019 assets or data, our ability to compete successfully in competitive markets, our ability to respond to rapid technological changes, and our ability to continue to innovate and develop new Applications. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\n\nExcept as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis document includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP are included at the end of this press release following the accompanying financial data.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. In addition, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not reflect our future contractual commitments or the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period. These and other limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing Samsara\u2019s operating results through the eyes of management and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to evaluate our business.\n\nExpenses Excluded from Non-GAAP Performance Financial Measures\u2014Stock-based compensation expense-related charges include the amortization of deferred stock-based compensation expense for capitalized software and employer taxes on employee equity transactions. Stock-based compensation expense-related charges are excluded because they are primarily a non-cash expense that management believes is not reflective of our ongoing operational performance. Employer taxes on employee equity transactions, which are a cash expense, are excluded because such taxes are directly tied to the timing and size of employee equity transactions and the future fair market value of our common stock, which may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business.\n\nLease modification, impairment, and related charges, and legal settlements are excluded because management believes that such charges are not reflective of our ongoing operational performance.\n\nOperating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\u2014We define ARR as the annualized value of subscription contracts that have commenced revenue recognition as of the measurement date.\n\nAdjusted Revenue and Adjusted Revenue Growth Rate\u2014Q4 FY24 was a 14-week fiscal quarter instead of a typical 13-week fiscal quarter. To enable comparability across periods, adjusted revenue and adjusted revenue growth rate are calculated by multiplying Q4 FY24 revenue by 13/14 to remove the impact of an additional week of revenue recognition in Q4 FY24.\n\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin\u2014We define non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense-related charges included in cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of total revenue. We use non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations.\n\nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin\u2014We define non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, or non-GAAP operating income (loss), as income (loss) from operations excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense-related charges, lease modification, impairment, and related charges, and legal settlements. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of total revenue. We use non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP operating margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP operating margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share\u2014We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense-related charges, lease modification, impairment, and related charges, and legal settlements. Our non-GAAP net income (loss) per share\u2013basic is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Our non-GAAP net income per share\u2013diluted is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (stock options, restricted stock units, and shares issued under our 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan) to the extent they are dilutive. Non-GAAP net loss per share\u2013diluted is the same as non-GAAP net loss per share\u2013basic as the inclusion of all potential dilutive common stock equivalents would be antidilutive. We use non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin\u2014We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities reduced by cash used for purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of total revenue. We believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin, even if negative, are useful in evaluating liquidity and provide information to management and investors about our ability to fund future operating needs and strategic initiatives.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin\u2014We define adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow excluding the cash impact of non-recurring capital expenditures associated with the build-out of our corporate office facilities in San Francisco, California, net of tenant allowances, and legal settlements. Adjusted free cash flow margin is calculated as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of total revenue. We believe that adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow margin, even if negative, are useful in evaluating liquidity and provide information to management and investors about our ability to fund future operating needs and strategic initiatives by excluding the impact of non-recurring events.\n\nWebcast Information and Shareholder Letter\n\nAn investor presentation and accompanying shareholder letter is accessible from the Samsara investor relations website at https://investors.samsara.com/. Samsara will host a live webcast to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) today. The live webcast may be accessed at https://investors.samsara.com/.

        "content": "Contrary to the dramatic headlines about robots replacing human workers, a robotics & automation revolution is quietly reshaping multiple industries \u2014 changing their entire faces rather than just swapping one form of labor for another.\n\nBut there\u2019s a hitch for retail investors: many of the most innovative robotics & automation stocks remain private, limiting public investment opportunities. While ETFs like the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA:IRBO) or even Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) offer a way to invest in this sector indirectly, they may not satisfy all investors\u2019 desires to target some of the top tech directly.\n\nFor those who prefer a self-directed, active management approach to robotics & automation stocks, these seven publicly traded robotics & automation stocks represent the best in their class. These companies span the gamut of market capitalizations, offering both the stability of large caps and the growth potential of small caps, alongside a wide range of industries to best diversify your robotics & automation stock holdings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZebra Technologies (ZBRA) A photo of the sign for Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) outside of a building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi/ShutterStock.com\n\nZebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is upstream of the wider robotics & automation sector by providing downstream developers with essential technology and tools, including sensing and communication technologies. The company offers autonomous, customizable base model robots to industries seeking to integrate workplace robotics yet lack ready-made solutions or are otherwise unable to afford internal R&D. Zebra provides customizable robotics platforms that can be tailored to meet specific industry needs\u2014a key aspect of the burgeoning robotics & automation market.\n\nUnlike many companies in the robotics space, Zebra stands out for its profitability and stability, attributes bolstered by its diverse revenue streams spanning printing, scanning, computing, and software technology. This diversification allows Zebra to invest confidently in its growing robotics division without the heightened financial risks typically associated with the sector.\n\nTrue to form, the company\u2019s most recent quarterly report blew past analyst expectations, marking $1.18 billion in sales (beating expectations by 2.17%) and a $2.84 EPS, compared to analyst consensus estimates of $2.45. Shares surged on the news, but don\u2019t let that dissuade you from investing in this robotics & automation stock for the long haul.\n\nStory continues\n\nRobotics & Automation Stocks: Samsara (IOT) a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\n\nLike Zebra Technologies, Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is a top player building the infrastructure necessary for robotics & automation systems to function. However, as its ticker symbol suggests, Samsara is deeply involved in the expanding Internet of Things (IoT) sector. The IoT encompasses a network of interconnected physical objects and their communication systems. Samsara\u2019s technology is the invisible backbone integrating industrial robots into a seamless operational network.\n\nToday, Samsara focuses on the big picture, applying its technology on a larger scale and focusing on applications such as fleet vehicle management and safety, movement tracking, and heavy equipment operations. Behind the scenes, these areas are critical to efficient and safe workflows.\n\nWhile Samsara has not achieved profitability, its prospects remain bright for investors interested in robotics stocks. The company\u2019s latest financial report showed a 39% increase in annual recurring revenue and a 20% improvement in its adjusted free cash flow margin. With management aiming for positive non-GAAP earnings within the year, Samsara represents a promising investment in the foundational technologies that will drive the future of home and industrial robotics.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) is a defense sector stock loved by Cathie Wood of Ark Invest fame. It is increasingly emphasizing integrated robotics & automation within its value chain. The company is primarily known for its forays into drone tech, with its flagship Raven UAS being one of the most widely used small surveillance drones leveraged by the United States and partner nations. But, increasingly, it\u2019s also bringing peripheral robotics & automation tech into the fold, as evidenced by a 2023 acquisition.\n\nLast September, AeroVironment rolled supplier Tomahawk Robotics into its company via strategic acquisition. Tomahawk develops control systems that rely on artificial intelligence, and the acquisition lets AeroVironment \u201cfurther integrate both companies\u2019 technologies and accelerate [their] implementation of AI and autonomy into AeroVironment\u2019s platforms,\u201d according to Chairman, President, and CEO Wahid Nawabi.\n\nLike other top robotics & automation stocks on the list, AeroVironment recently posted strong quarterly earnings. Highlights include a $0.63 EPS, nearly doubling analyst estimates, on sales of $186.58 million \u2014 10% higher than prior revenue projections.\n\nRobotics & Automation Stocks: Cognex Corp (CGNX) Cognex (CGNX) logo displayed on smartphone with pink and blue background behind, symbolizing CGNX stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rafapress\n\nCognex Corp (NASDAQ:CGNX) is another upstream robotics & automation stock, offering investors a wide range of machine vision, guidance, and sensing systems targeting industrial manufacturing processes. The company\u2019s tech helps smooth out automated industrial systems by helping identify parts, pin down defects during assembly, and keep the robotic systems moving and online. Insiders bought Cognex stock hand-over-fist last year, enforcing the stock\u2019s long-term prospects.\n\nThe company\u2019s strong financial standing includes a 17% R&D-to-revenue conversion rate and a 72% gross margin rate. Better yet, Cognex is a strong contender among dividend stocks, with a 20-year track record of consecutive payouts and a current 1.6% total yield. Though first-quarter sales slumped slightly, this represents an ideal buying opportunity for long-term robotics & automation investors \u2014 shares are down 5% over the past month, but don\u2019t expect the stock to stay suppressed for long.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a powerhouse among robotics & automation stocks, merging advanced technology, robotics, and the ever-profitable healthcare sector. A top player in both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices, Intuitive Surgical reliably supplies specialized, high-end medical equipment that sets it apart from competitors that focus on traditional medical hardware. Better yet, its top tech offerings revolutionize surgical procedures by improving efficiency and patient outcomes.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is aggressively expanding its global presence as the healthcare industry continues rebounding. The company\u2019s most recent quarterly report showcased a notable 16% year-over-year increase in the usage of its flagship robotic surgery system, the da Vinci platform, maintaining a consistent installation rate with 313 units installed this year, compared to 312 in the first quarter of 2023. Coupled with an 11% increase in sales and a rise in net income to $545 million from $355 million, these achievements reinforce Intuitive Surgical\u2019s standing as a premier robotics & automation stock.\n\nLooking ahead, Intuitive Surgical is gearing up to launch its next-generation da Vinci platform. CEO Gary Guthart has indicated that this new model will possess \u201c10,000 times the processing power\u201d of existing models, substantially improving data analysis, sensing technology, and digital functions, ultimately elevating the company\u2019s offerings and market position significantly.\n\nRobotics & Automation Stocks: Symbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the mid-cap front, Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) is revolutionizing how prominent retailers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), handle their warehouse operations. Symbotic employs AI to drive its warehouse robotics platforms, enabling quicker, more efficient selection, packing, and shipping than traditional methods while improving safety practices and reducing costs. Although major brands are currently its primary clientele, Symbotic\u2019s strategy to broaden its market reach could propel this robotics & automation stock to new heights.\n\nThe company is exploring a new initiative to make warehouse automation and robotics accessible to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which typically lack the financial means to invest in the technology that larger corporations can afford. Symbotic\u2019s approach involves targeting multi-user warehouse complexes and integrating automation into the facilities as part of a leasing incentive instead of selling directly to SMBs.\n\nWhile big-name clients continue to provide a steady revenue stream, the SMB sector represents a vast, largely untapped market for robotics & automation stocks. Successfully tapping into this segment could create a sustainable revenue model for Symbotic, turning it into a diversified, recession-proof robotics & automation stock for years to come.\n\niRobot (IRBT) In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) is a speculative (but cheap) robotics & automation stock that\u2019s seen tough times yet remains worth buying \u2014 though perhaps not for the reasons you expect. While its range of autonomous vacuum cleaners has its merits, the real value in iRobot lies in its extensive portfolio of advanced, patented technology and the potential for third-party licensing. This was a key factor behind Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) interest in acquiring the company.\n\nAmazon\u2019s bid to acquire iRobot revealed a previously unknown patent Amazon filed, describing \u201cAn autonomously motile device [that] may be capable of moving or performing other actions within an environment.\u201d This description hints at a hybrid between an Amazon Alexa and an iRobot vacuum, showcasing the strategic nature of Amazon\u2019s attempt to acquire iRobot for $1.7 billion\u2014aiming to leverage iRobot\u2019s technology rather than develop similar tech in-house. Of course, the acquisition fizzled out, but understanding Amazon\u2019s initial motivation to buy the robotics & automation stock reveals iRobot\u2019s latent potential.\n\nDespite the setback with Amazon\u2019s acquisition, iRobot\u2019s technological assets and patent portfolio remain valuable, with ample opportunities for further acquisitions or licensing deals. Moreover, with iRobot trading at just 0.3x sales, this stock offers compelling value, making it an attractive buy for those looking to invest in the future of at-home robotics.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Samsara (IOT) Reports Earnings Tomorrow: What To Expect\n\nInternet of Things company Samsara (NYSE:IOT) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow after market hours. Here's what to look for.\n\nSamsara beat analysts' revenue expectations by 7% last quarter, reporting revenues of $276.3 million, up 48.1% year on year. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates.\n\nIs Samsara a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Samsara's revenue to grow 33.3% year on year to $272.4 million, slowing from the 43.2% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.01 per share. Samsara Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Samsara has a history of exceeding Wall Street's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 7.3% on average.\n\nLooking at Samsara's peers in the data analytics segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Amplitude delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 9.2%, meeting analysts' expectations, and Palantir reported revenues up 20.8%, topping estimates by 2.7%. Amplitude traded down 1.7% following the results while Palantir was also down 15.1%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Amplitude's results here and Palantir's results here.\n\nGrowth stocks have been quite volatile since the start of 2024, and while some of the data analytics stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share prices down 6.6% on average over the last month. Samsara is down 12% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $41.4 (compared to the current share price of $33.67).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "content": "Samsara Inc. IOT is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jun 6.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal first quarter, Samsara expects revenues in the range of $271-$273 million, suggesting 33-34% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $272.51 million, indicating a rise of 33.37% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at 1 cent per share against a loss of 2 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for earnings has been stable in the past 30 days.\n\nSamsara Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Samsara Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSamsara Inc. price-eps-surprise | Samsara Inc. Quote\n\nSamsara\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 135.83% on average.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for Samsara prior to this announcement:\n\nFactors to Note\n\nSamsara\u2019s fiscal first quarter is likely to have benefited from the strength of its diversified portfolio offerings and continued expansion of its customer base, particularly large enterprise customers.\r\n\r\nWith a robust fiscal fourth-quarter performance highlighted by an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of $1.1 billion and 39% year-over-year growth, Samsara is well-positioned to leverage its portfolio strength and a growing customer base, particularly in the large enterprise in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company has been successful in landing new customers and expanding existing customer relationships. Samsara added a quarterly record number of core and large customers in fourth-quarter fiscal 2024, including two $1 million-plus new logos and six $1 million-plus expansion deals.\r\n\r\nSamsara\u2019s growing customer momentum, particularly in industries such as transportation, construction and the public sector, is expected to have contributed to its revenue growth in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of new products like the Connected Forms application, which streamlines workflows through digital forms, is anticipated to showcase the strength of IOT\u2019s portfolio in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nSamsara is expected to have witnessed strong growth and adoption of its video-based safety, vehicle telematics, and equipment monitoring products. The company has empowered United Natural Foods UNFI to drive sustainability and safety advancements across its extensive operations like fleet management on the back of these solutions.\r\n\r\nIn April, Samsara announced that United Natural Foods chose Samsara to drive sustainability and safety progress by adopting its Vehicle Telematics, Asset Gateways, Environmental Monitors and Video-Based Safety solutions.\r\n\r\nIOT\u2019s expansion into international markets, with notable success in regions such as Mexico and Europe, is expected to have bolstered its performance during the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Indicates\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

While each of their operations are unique, the need for data and AI-driven insights is universal,\" said Sanjit Biswas, CEO and co-founder at Samsara. \"I\u2019m proud of the impact we\u2019re driving with our customers and of the progress we\u2019re making on our own goals.

This compares to earnings of $0.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.11, delivering a surprise of 22.22%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nPaycor HCM , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, posted revenues of $187.02 million for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.36%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $161.48 million.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Paycor HCM: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

        "content": "By now, you\u2019ve heard of the Internet of Things (IoT) \u2014 or the network of physical devices, vehicles and other things embedded with sensors, software and network connectivity, which\u00a0allows them to collect and share data.\u00a0That includes smart thermostats, smartwatches, vehicles and industrial machines to name a few. There have even been calls for \u201csmart cities\u201d based on IoT. All of which is a catalyst for some of the top IoT stocks.\n\nPlus,\u00a0according to IBM (NYSE:IBM), \u201cThe number of IoT devices is expected to continue to grow rapidly, with estimates suggesting that there will be tens of billion IoT devices in use over the next few years. This growth will be driven by increased adoption across industries, as well as the development of new use cases and applications.\u201d\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence\u00a0and machine learning are becoming increasingly important for IoT, as they can be used to analyze vast amounts of data that is generated by IoT devices and extract meaningful insights. This can help businesses make more informed decisions and optimize their operations,\u201d they added.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNo wonder the market could be worth about $3.37 trillion by 2031, according to analysts at SNS Insider. Even better, here are some of the top IoT stocks that should thrive on the growth.\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAfter finding strong double-bottom support $30,\u00a0Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is back to $36.82. From here, I\u2019d like to see it retest its high of about $40 initially, as it continues with its strong uptrend.\n\nHelping, analysts at\u00a0Loop Capital just initiated a buy rating on the stock with a $42 price target. All thanks to its exposure to artificial intelligence, machine learning and IoT. Additionally, its technology allows it to be supportive of \u201cnearly endless\u201d use cases, implying that Samsara\u2019s total addressable market has few constraints, added the firm, as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nMost recently, IOT announced a collaboration with logistics and transportation company TMS to help improve the safety of drivers and operators, while reducing accidents.\n\n\u201cAs part of this partnership, TMS will integrate Samsara\u2019s AI Dash Cams into its comprehensive security program. These cameras will provide real-time in-cab alerts as well as the ability to retrieve video on demand, allowing TMS to reduce mobile device use while driving and easily exonerate non-at-fault drivers in the event of incidents,\u201d\u00a0as noted in the press release.\n\nGlobal X Internet of Things ETF (SNSR)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nWe can also look at IoT-related exchange traded funds (ETFs) such as the\u00a0Global X Internet of Things ETF(NASDAQ:SNSR). Since bottoming out at around $28 in late 2023, the ETF ran to about $37. Now at $34.77, it\u2019s still a strong opportunity.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.68%, the SNSR ETF holds 53 stocks that could benefit from \u201cbroader adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), as enabled by technologies such as WiFi, 5G telecommunications infrastructure, and fiber optics,\u201d as noted by Global X ETFs.\n\n\u201cThis includes the development and manufacturing of semiconductors and sensors, integrated products and solutions, and applications serving smart grids, smart homes, connected cars, and the industrial internet,\u201d they added.\n\nSome of its top holdings include\u00a0Garmin (NYSE:GRMN), DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM), STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to name a few. What\u2019s nice about the SNSR ETF is that we can buy 100 shares for about $3,477 and gain exposure to 45 stocks.\n\nAptiv (APTV) An Aptiv (APTV) office building in Poland.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com\n\nThere\u2019s also beaten-down, oversold shares of\u00a0Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), which exploded on Thursday.\n\nThe global technology company develops connected solutions enabling a more sustainable future of mobility. It just saw its stock pop about $8 on earnings. While its adjusted earnings per share of $1.16 beat estimates for $1.01, revenues of $4.901 billion missed expectations of $5.008 billion.\n\n\u201cAptiv delivered solid results in the first quarter with 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year and a return to growth above market, despite a slowdown in electrification in North America and Europe and persistent labor and material cost headwinds,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Kevin Clark, chairman and chief executive officer in a company press release.\n\nThe company also raised its fiscal year 2024 adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $5.80 to $6.30, as compared the estimates calling for $5.75. However, it did lower its revenue outlook to a new range of $20.85 billion to $20.45 billion, which is below estimates for $21.57 billion.\n\nFortunately, as we begin to see some improvement in global electric vehicle sales, Aptiv\u2019s numbers should start to come back strong.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Should You Investigate Samsara Inc. (NYSE:IOT) At US$36.82?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Samsara Inc. (NYSE:IOT). The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of 22% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s examine Samsara\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Samsara\n\nWhat Is Samsara Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Samsara seems to be fairly priced at around 15% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Samsara today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $43.28, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Samsara\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Samsara generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Samsara's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 23%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in IOT\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on IOT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Samsara you should know about.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Samsara, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nReal-time fleet visibility and monitoring enables international haulage firm to ensure safety and security of drivers and cargo\n\nLONDON, April 25, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--International haulage company JJX Logistics has improved the safety and sustainability of its fleet operations by implementing advanced AI solutions from Samsara, the pioneer of the Connected Operations\u2122 Cloud. The move has enabled JJX Logistics to achieve a 17% reduction in fleet emissions in just three months and become one of the seven UK companies to gain Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA) Trucking Security Requirements (TSR) Level 1 approval.\n\nWith more than 70% of goods handled by JJX Logistics being UN-regulated dangerous goods \u2014 such as commercial lithium-ion battery packs and Class 8 corrosive liquids \u2014 Samsara has played a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of drivers carrying dangerous, high-value cargo.\n\nBy fitting its fleet of 58 hard-bodied, soft-sided and temperature-regulated trailers, Sprinter vans, and articulated trucks with Samsara\u2019s dual-facing cameras and AI-driven Vehicle Gateways, JJX Logistics has full visibility of every vehicle, which can be monitored and tracked on a single screen.\n\n\u200b\u200bSamsara\u2019s technology has also been pivotal in reducing overall vehicle emissions and improving fuel efficiency. Within the first three months of implementing Samsara\u2019s monitoring features, the company has achieved a 17% reduction in vehicle emissions. The ability to monitor idling times has also helped to shape changes in driver behaviour, saving almost 400 gallons of fuel in the second half of 2023.\n\nEdward Martin, Head of Security & Fleet Compliance at JJX Logistics comments: \"We\u2019re continuously operating in a high-pressure environment where compliance is paramount. We\u2019re not about moving items from A to B in bulk, as fast or as cheap as possible \u2013 we\u2019re a solutions-driven company who work with our customers to tailor the perfect approach for every individual task. And we are able to operate at a high level of service because of the value the Samsara technology adds to our operations.\n\n\"Our vehicles are now being driven better, and this is increasing sustainability, fuel efficiency and hopefully insurance costs. The real-time tracking, transparency and efficiency we can now achieve is part of our credibility as a business.\"\n\nPhilip van der Wilt, SVP and GM EMEA at Samsara, said: \"Like us, JJX Logistics views every customer engagement as a partnership. Trustworthiness, reliability and customer service are at the heart of their business and regardless of what they transport, one thing that links their customers and their consignments is security and the assurance they can provide to ensure that their loads are safe. We\u2019re pleased that our technology is playing a pivotal role in that, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing our partnership with JJX grow even further.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout Samsara\n\nSamsara is the pioneer of the Connected Operations\u2122 Cloud, which is a platform that enables organisations that depend on physical operations to harness Internet of Things (IoT) data to develop actionable insights and improve their operations.

        "content": "Samsara & UNFI (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, April 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Samsara Inc. (\"Samsara\") (NYSE: IOT), the pioneer of the Connected Operations\u2122 Cloud, today announced United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE: UNFI), the largest full-service grocery wholesaling partner in North America, chose Samsara to achieve new sustainability and safety progress. UNFI has adopted Samsara Vehicle Telematics, Asset Gateways, Environmental Monitors, and Video-Based Safety.\n\n\"The safety, efficiency, and sustainability improvements UNFI will make with Samsara will help us change our business for the better. A core part of UNFI\u2019s customer and supplier-centric strategy is continuous improvement and better efficiency,\" said Gregory Tieder, Senior Director of Corporate Logistics at UNFI.\n\nReducing Emissions and Waste for a More Sustainable World\n\nThe majority of UNFI\u2019s direct emissions are from its fleet, and by the end of its fiscal year 2030, the company has a goal to sharply reduce Scope 1 and 3 emissions from transportation. UNFI has developed an electric vehicle (EV) blueprint, covering multiple California distribution centers and fleets, to better understand where EVs can benefit its operations. It is also using technology, like Samsara Vehicle Telematics, to improve customer deliveries, and reduce fuel-wasting behaviors, like idling, in its existing internal combustion engine-powered trucks.\n\nUNFI\u2019s goal is to achieve zero waste to landfills from distribution centers by fiscal year 2030. The company transports about 41,000 pounds of food daily, and temperature control is critical for product freshness and safety. Each trailer has multiple temperature zones to accommodate the variety of products supplied to its customers on a single route. UNFI uses Samsara Environmental Monitors to ensure food safety and reduce waste from load loss. In addition to the sustainability benefits, these outcomes mean decreased costs for UNFI and a better experience for its customers who rely on UNFI\u2019s products to nourish their communities.\n\nFrom Forklift to Truck, Increasing Employee Safety Throughout the Supply Chain\n\nSafety is a core value for UNFI and one of its goals is to ensure all 30,000 associates arrive home safely at the end of the day. UNFI believes this effort requires supporting associates with the best training and technology to increase safety.\n\n\"UNFI operates 24/7 to meet the needs of our customers. They expect on-time deliveries despite poor weather, heavy traffic, and other challenges we face on the road. High-quality service creates complexity, but we won\u2019t compromise on safety. Samsara helps us to reliably deliver for our customers while also strengthening our safety practices,\" said Tieder.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore than 2 million cases are delivered to its customers by UNFI drivers daily, which makes efficient utilization of transportation assets critical. By equipping its trailers with Samsara Asset Gateways, UNFI views their locations in real time. This improved visibility is expected to result in higher utilization of assets, cost savings, and timely service for its customers.\n\n\"UNFI is taking incredible steps to improve North America's food system, accelerate its sustainability efforts, and increase associate safety,\" said Lara Caimi, President of Worldwide Field Operations at Samsara. \"Every day, we see how transformative it is for large, complex organizations to use a single platform to manage and optimize their operations with Samsara. We can't wait to see what UNFI and Samsara accomplish together.\"\n\nTo learn more about Samsara\u2019s platform, visit here.\n\nAbout Samsara\n\nSamsara (NYSE: IOT) is the pioneer of the Connected Operations\u2122 Cloud, which is a platform that enables organizations that depend on physical operations to harness Internet of Things (IoT) data to develop actionable insights and improve their operations.

        "title": "Ground Floor Investing: 3 Stocks to Snag Before At-Home Robots Go Mainstream",
        "content": "We may be far from the at-home robotics revolution the Jetsons promised, but there\u2019s still plenty of innovation brewing beneath the surface. While headlines often declare the imminent replacement of workers by AI-enabled robots, reality presents a more optimistic scenario. As the quality of our lives and the dollar value of our labor rise, we\u2019re likely to keep outsourcing greater aspects of our at-home lives to autonomous or robotics systems.\n\nHowever, one issue for retail investors is that many of the most groundbreaking companies remain private, limiting public investment opportunities. This inaccessibility makes investing in the top future robotics firms challenging, although ETFs like Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) can somewhat mitigate this gap.\n\nIf you prefer not to automate your investment in robotics stocks through ETFs, these three companies stand out as top contenders among robotics stocks, targeting a future at-home market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZebra Technologies (ZBRA) A photo of the sign for Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) outside of a building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi/ShutterStock.com\n\nZebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is a robotics stock selling picks and shovels to at-home robotics makers via a range of sensing and communications tech and tools. Most interestingly, the company sells autonomous robot base models to industries adapting to workplace robotics but that lack off-the-shelf options elsewhere. In other words, Zebra is selling robotics platforms easily tweaked, changed and adapted to specific needs \u2014 exactly what the future of at-home robotics promises.\n\nUnlike many robotics stocks, Zebra is profitable and stable, though mostly due to its wide-ranging revenue streams, including printing, scanning, computing and software tech. Still, diverse revenue streams mean that Zebra can afford to pump cash into its burgeoning robotics section with fewer risks of losing the operation to a robotics money pit.\n\nThe company\u2019s end-of-year report affirms its overall strength, as the robotics stock hit $296 million in net income at a 6.5% margin \u2014 not bad, all things considered. Still, the report was a miss and investors were disappointed. Shares dipped slightly, but not drastically, as many recognize Zebra\u2019s long-term robotics potential. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s too late to ride this bandwagon into the at-home robotics future.\n\niRobot (IRBT) In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\niRobot (NASDA:IRBT) is an easy pick for at-home robotics stocks, but not for the reasons you may immediately think of. Don\u2019t buy iRobot stock for its range of autonomous vacuum cleaners (as useful as they may be). Instead, buy iRobot stock for its deep portfolio of advanced patented tech and the opportunities available for third-party licensing. After all, that\u2019s what drove Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) ill-fated acquisition.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust look at Amazon\u2019s existing patent, uncovered early in the company\u2019s iRobot foray, for \u201cAn autonomously motile device [that] may be capable of moving or performing other actions within an environment.\u201d Sounds like an Amazon Alexa-meets-iRobot vacuum, doesn\u2019t it? There\u2019s little doubt in my mind that Amazon\u2019s attempted acquisition was an attempt to buy iRobot\u2019s underlying tech for $1.7 billion rather than develop systems in-house. And, just because Amazon\u2019s acquisition is on the outs doesn\u2019t mean iRobot\u2019s underlying tech and patent portfolio is useless \u2013 additional acquisition and licensing opportunities abound. Likewise, trading at just 0.3x sales, this robotics stock is just too cheap to ignore.\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLike Zebra Technologies, Samsara (NYSE:IOT) makes and integrates the underlying infrastructure that robotics systems need to operate in your home. In this case, rather than advanced sensing tech, Samsara works extensively within the growing Internet of Things sector, as the company\u2019s IOT ticker implies. The Internet of Things broadly describes an interconnected network of physical objects and the underlying means of communication between them. In a nutshell, Samsara\u2019s tech applied to at-home automation could basically act as the invisible ecosystem tying a range of robots together and keeping the entire operation running smoothly.\n\nSamsara is already testing and deploying that tech, albeit at a much larger scale. The company\u2019s current efforts focus on fleet vehicle management and safety, movement tracking, heavy equipment operations and similarly behind-the-scenes but impactful workflows.\n\nSamsara hasn\u2019t quite nailed profitability yet, but that shouldn\u2019t stop early investors interested in robotics stocks. The company\u2019s most recent report included a 39% annual recurring revenue increase and a 20% improvement to its overall adjusted free cash flow margin \u2013 not bad, especially considering management expects to nail positive non-GAAP earnings this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nBorderlands is a weekly rundown of developments in the world of United States-Mexico cross-border trucking and trade. This week: Samsara opens new office to focus on expanding cross-border trade; TriumphPay expands payments network to Mexico; China-based auto supplier to build $36M factory in Mexico; and Quantix acquires hazardous waste hauler in Houston.\n\nSamsara opens new office to focus on expanding cross-border trade\n\nSan Francisco-based Samsara recently opened a new office in Mexico City aiming to support a growing customer base south of the border.\n\nThe telematics solution provider first entered the Mexican market in 2019 and has increased its customer base rapidly, collecting five of the top 10 trucking companies in Mexico as customers.\n\nWith the new office, Samsara officials expect to double the number of employees in Mexico by the end of the year to around 400 people. The company is also investing in business technology, operations, sales and support roles to meet the growing demand in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are growing across the board with sales, support, and finance, so that our customers are very well covered throughout their journey,\u201d Julia Monroy, Samsara sales director for Mexico, told FreightWaves. \u201cToday we have around 200 employees based in Mexico, compared to two years ago, when we were only 10. It\u2019s been a really great growth and we\u2019re expecting to double the amount of employees over the next year.\u201d\n\nSamsara (NYSE: IOT), founded in 2015, provides a connected cloud to modernize physical operations, such as commercial fleets and industrial activities. The company has more than 20,000 customers in the energy, food and beverage, construction and manufacturing and transportation industries.\n\nSanjit Biswas, Samsara\u2019s CEO and co-founder, said Mexico\u2019s trucking industry has been focused on enhancing security and keeping drivers safe on the road.\n\n\u201cOur rapid growth in Mexico shows the strong return on investment we provide to our customers. Samsara\u2019s new office will provide a space for in-person collaboration for our growing team as we continue to invest in new product innovations specific to the needs of the Mexico market,\u201d Biswas said in a news release.\n\nStory continues Samsara recently opened a new office in Mexico City and expects to double its workforce in the country by the end of the year. (Photo: Samsara)\n\nSamsara\u2019s growth in Mexico has largely been driven by its focus on customers\u2019 needs, Monroy said.\n\n\u201cIt is very interesting how Samsara has tended to localize our products for the Mexican market. I love to share the story regarding the immobilizer,\u201d Monroy said. \u201cWhen we started our operation here in Mexico, we didn\u2019t have the immobilizer for our customers. We would go to different meetings, present at different associations and companies, and they would say, \u201cif you don\u2019t have an immobilizer, we\u2019re unable to use your product. This is critical because of security reasons.\u201d\n\nSamsara\u2019s immobilizer stops vehicles automatically when tampering is detected, with the aim of keeping both truck drivers and the cargo safe from criminals.\n\n\u201cWe were able to get with our product team, and they developed the first version of an immobilizer, within six months. So this was something that created trust among our customers, where we showed that we were committed to localizing our products,\u201d Monroy said.\n\nIn the past year, Samsara has also released several new features specifically tailored to the Mexico market, including:\n\n\u2014Driver QR codes: pairs drivers with their vehicles through QR codes to lead to a better driver experience.\n\n\u2014AG52 Asset Gateway: a device which can be connected with cargo and door sensors to provide real-time alerts on door activities and the presence of cargo, to improve theft detection and prevention.\n\nTrends in nearshoring have accelerated the trade partnership between Mexico and the U.S. Mexico was the top trading partner for the U.S. in 2023, the first year in over two decades that the U.S. bought more goods from Mexico than China.\n\nMonroy said she sees cross-border trade between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. continuing to grow and adopt more and more cutting edge technologies. The company\u2019s main product is its vehicle telematics gateway, but also offers technologies such as a smart dash camera that can capture more data.\n\n\u201cI think there are two main aspects of what I\u2019ve seen within our Mexican customers. One is how important and critical security is here. Trucking companies began adopting technology that can support their operations to act in a faster way to have visibility in real time, which is critical today,\u201d Monroy said. \u201cThe second piece that I\u2019ve seen with the companies evolving is the adoption of safety measures, and how they want to really invest in their operators using technology. I was able to see that transition of pioneers in Mexico adopting our cameras, and how that evolved in today being something that most of the companies need today.\u201d\n\nTriumphPay expands payments network to Mexico\n\nDallas-based TriumphPay recently announced the expansion of its open payments network for the freight transportation industry to include Mexican pesos.\n\nCompany officials said the expansion is a significant step forward for the network which currently offers its payment services to shippers, brokers, carriers, and factors in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars.\n\n\u201cExpanding our payments network to Mexico is critical for our customers as trade increases between the U.S. and Mexico,\u201d Melissa Forman, president of TriumphPay. \u201cOur expansion into Mexico clearly indicates TriumphPay\u2019s commitment to providing brokers, factors, carriers and shippers worldwide with fast payments that offer security, efficiency and transparency.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the second quarter, TriumphPay expects to have the ability to make standard term payments in Mexican pesos for carriers, provide customer service and support in Spanish, and offer the automation of payment processing in pesos.\n\nTriumphPay is a payments network for freight brokers, factors, shippers and carriers in the trucking industry. The company also offers tools and services to increase automation, mitigate fraud, create back-office efficiency and improve the payment experience.\n\nChina-based auto supplier to build $36M factory in Mexico\n\nUTAS-NOVA Automotive Lighting Systems Co. recently announced it is building a factory in the Mexican city of Aguascalientes to manufacture automotive parts.\n\nThe new factory will create about 220 jobs and will be dedicated to producing automotive lighting components such as headlamps, brake lights, license plate lights and tail lights.\n\nUTAS-NOVA was founded in Danyang, China, in 1994. The company\u2019s customers include General Motors, Stellantis, JAC Motors, Beijing Automotive Group Co. and AIC Motor Corp.\n\nQuantix acquires hazardous waste hauler in Houston\n\nQuantix recently announced the acquisition of Houston-based Space City Services, a company that specializes in the transportation of hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals and waste materials throughout the Gulf Coast region.\n\nQuantix, which is based in The Woodlands, Texas, is a supply chain services company operating in the chemical industry. The company is part of a portfolio owned by Wind Point Partners, a Chicago-based private equity investment firm with approximately $7 billion in assets under management.\n\nQuantix operates 30 terminals and 20 warehousing/packaging facilities nationwide and has a fleet of over 5,000 trucks, trailers and other highly specialized equipment.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition is important for Quantix as we continue to lead the chemical industry in being a comprehensive provider of supply chain solutions for every need,\u201d Chris Ball, president and CEO of Quantix, said in a news release.\n\nMore articles by Noi Mahoney\n\nOver 1,300 layoffs hit logistics companies across US\n\nCanada\u2019s Pride Group files for bankruptcy protection, faces $100M lawsuit\n\nInvestment surges in Mexico as companies shift supply chains, plan new factories\n\nThe post Borderlands Mexico: Samsara opens new office to focus on expanding cross-border trade appeared first on FreightWaves.",

        "content": "The Forbes 400 is a list of America\u2019s 400 wealthiest people. Right now, to get on the coveted list, one\u2019s net worth has to be at least $2.9 billion. According to Forbes, the wealthiest 400 have a combined net worth of $4.5 trillion, with many of the names getting rich from technology. Although many billionaires on the list made their wealth from private businesses, many of the Forbes 400 stocks represented by people on the list are companies investors have never heard of.\n\nHow does the list compare to the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index? It\u2019s a global list with 500 names rather than 400. In addition, it\u2019s calculated in real-time, so the wealthiest person on its list at the time of this article\u2019s publication is Bernard Arnault, the CEO and controlling shareholder of LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY). His current net worth is $226 billion. Forbes\u2019 list had Elon Musk in the top position at $251 billion, but that was before Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) 2024 meltdown.\n\nMost of the other names in the Forbes 400 are founders or large shareholders of companies investors are familiar with. However, there are some that most investors wouldn\u2019t know about. Here are three of them for your consideration.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoyalty Pharma (RPRX) Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.\n\nSource: Billion Photos / Shutterstock\n\nRoyalty Pharma (NASDAQ:RPRX) is the world\u2019s largest investor in pharmaceutical royalty streams. It provides drug developers with the capital to carry out clinical trials and commercialize these drugs for a percentage of future revenue.\n\nFounded in 1996 by current CEO Pablo Legorreta, it went public in 2020 and now has a market capitalization of over $17 billion. Legorreta manages more than $17 billion of assets through RP Management, his affiliated business. According to Forbes, his net worth is $3.1 billion. He\u2019s also the 1,076th-wealthiest person on Forbes\u2019 list of global billionaires.\n\nRoyalty Pharma\u2019s stock has not performed well since its initial public offering (IPO). Right now, its shares are up by just over a dollar from its $28 offering price. But in January 2021, they traded above $51.\n\nThe company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in 2023 was $2.8 billion, 9% higher than in 2022. Right now, investors looking at this Forbes 400 stock can get paid a 2.8% dividend yield while they wait for it to return to the above $50 level.\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSamsara (NYSE:IOT) provides hardware and software for companies to harness their physical operations\u2019 IoT (Internet of Things) data to lower their costs and make better decisions about those assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Bicket is the San Francisco-based company\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and co-founder. Bicket created the company with CEO Sanjit Biswas in 2015. Samsara went public in December 2021 at $23 a share and an $11.5 billion valuation. Today, it\u2019s worth nearly $19 billion.\n\nThe company reported its Q4 2024 results in early March. Its adjusted total revenue increased 37% to $256.5 million, with a non-GAAP operating profit of $13.5 million, up from a $14.7 million operating loss in Q4 2023. It finished the quarter with annual recurring revenue of $1.1 billion, 39% higher than a year earlier.\n\nIn fiscal year 2025, it expects 29.5% adjusted net revenue growth at the midpoint of its guidance, with a non-GAAP profit of $24 million. It finished the year with 1,848 customers spending more than $100,000 annually.\u00a0Its stock is up 76% in the past year. I recommended IOT in February, and still consider it to be one of the good choices for Forbes 400 stocks.\n\nAccording to the Forbes 400, Bicket\u2019s net worth is $3.5 billion. That puts him in the 326th spot. He\u2019s also the 842nd-wealthiest person on Forbes\u2019 list of global billionaires today.\n\nNew Mountain Finance Corp.

(NASDAQ:NMFC) is a business development company (BDC) that provides direct lending solutions to U.S. upper-middle market companies backed by private equity sponsors.\n\nThe businesses it invests in are companies with annual EBITDA of between $10 million and $200 million, with strong growth profiles in all economic cycles. The BDC is externally managed by New Mountain Finance Advisors BDC LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital, an alternative asset manager with more than $50 billion in assets under management.\n\nNew Mountain Finance finished 2023 with an investment portfolio of $3.03 billion and a weighted average yield to maturity of 10.9%. It had investments with 111 portfolio companies as of Dec. 31, 2023. The current loan-to-value ratio with these companies is 42%, providing NMFC with a reasonable margin of safety.\u00a0Since NMFC\u2019s IPO in May 2011, it\u2019s delivered an annualized cash-on-cash return of 10% for shareholders, paying out more than $1.2 billion in dividends.\n\nNew Mountain Capital was founded by Steve Klinsky in 1999. Today, it invests its assets under management in three areas: private equity, credit and net lease, which acquires operationally critical real estate from private equity-backed companies.\n\nKlinsky\u2019s net worth, according to the Forbes 400, is $3.6 billion. That puts him in the 314th spot. He\u2019s also the 900th-wealthiest person on Forbes\u2019 real-time list of global billionaires.\u00a0NMFC currently yields 10.1%, making it an attractive option for Forbes 400 stocks, even if you hadn\u2019t heard of it before now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Even as rates remain elevated and economic conditions seem sour, finding cheap stocks to buy isn\u2019t as easy as it was just a year ago. Looking forward to another cheap debt era, alongside unique tech trends and other sector-specific tailwinds, many of the most popular stocks are pricy from both a valuation and per-share pricing perspective.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t diamonds in the rough. These cheap stocks trade at low multiples and per-share pricing, but with a catch: each tends toward the speculative, with long-term prospects demanding patience as trends and tech matures. If you\u2019re willing to wait, though, these cheap stocks to buy represent some of the few remaining deals on the market.\n\nindie Semiconductor Inc (INDI) AI. Circuit board. Technology background.

Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSemiconductor stocks may have surged over the past year, but that doesn\u2019t mean the sector lacks its own slate of cheap stocks. Even as giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) face overvaluation, investors are increasingly uncovering small-cap and cheap semiconductor stocks in search of the next significant breakthrough. Among these, indie Semiconductor Inc (NASDAQ:INDI) stands out with its robust offerings tailored for the automotive and autonomous driving sectors, meeting the rising demand for cutting-edge car technologies, including driver assistance and enhanced infotainment systems.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn 2023, indie Semiconductor shattered records by doubling its revenue to $223.2 million. Furthermore, the company\u2019s profit margins impressively reached 52.5%, marking an increase of more than 2.5% from the previous year. This margin growth demonstrates indie Semiconductor\u2019s ability to excel amid changing economic landscapes by enhancing efficiencies and reducing costs without compromising quality. Though not yet profitable, its low debt load and slim 4x price-to-sales ratio make it a standout play among cheap semiconductor stocks \u2013 a sector that\u2019s increasingly shrinking today.\n\nCheap Stocks to Buy: Sirius XM Holdings Inc (SIRI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of US broadcasting company Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there\u2019s any reliable quality indicator for cheap stocks to buy, it\u2019s a Warren Buffett endorsement. And with Buffett snagging as much Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) stock as he can, this cheap satellite radio stock may be preparing for takeoff. Throughout Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) last few financial periods, Buffett and team focused primarily on selling stocks rather than bargain hunting new buys \u2013 with a few exceptions, including Sirius.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett values Sirius XM not just for potential corporate restructuring but as a solid value investment in its own right. Trading at low multiples, Sirius XM\u2019s sales are steady and reliable (if not spectacular). The company boasts over 30% EBITDA margins for four consecutive years and free cash flow surpassing $1 billion in the same period. Additionally, Sirius XM offers an appealing 4.69% dividend yield with a 31% payout ratio, showcasing the company\u2019s adept cash management that still takes reinvested earnings and growth into account.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Symbotic (SYM) Short-Squeeze Stocks\n\nCheap robotics and automation stock Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) is revolutionizing how major corporations, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), handle their warehouse operations. The company uses AI to streamline warehouse robotics platforms, enabling quicker and more efficient selection, packing, and shipping of goods than traditional methods. This enhances safety and saves significant cash. While currently serving high-profile brands, Symbotic\u2019s strategic shift towards broader accessibility could skyrocket the value of this robotics stock.\n\nSymbotic is crafting a strategy to extend warehouse automation and robotics to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that lack the resources to implement the efficiencies that giants like Walmart and Target enjoy. By focusing on multi-user warehouse complexes and integrating these services into the buildings as part of a leasing incentive rather than direct sales to SMBs, Symbotic is looking to capture a vast, largely untapped SMB market. Although big-name brands currently represent a major revenue source, tapping into the SMB sector could generate a continuous revenue stream for Symbotic, positioning the company for sustained financial success \u2013 meaning its cheap stock status likely won\u2019t last.\n\nCheap Stocks to Buy: Rocket Lab USA (RKLB) Homepage of Rocket lab (RKLB). Official website of company\n\nSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA\u2019s (NASDAQ:RKLB) recent stock dilution unsettled retail investors, but a temporary dip in share price shouldn\u2019t deter you from the cheap stock\u2019s significant long-term potential. Last year, Rocket Lab set records with unprecedented launch stats and secured a $515 million contract to construct and maintain 18 space vehicles for the U.S. government.\n\nThe company\u2019s impressive performance in 2023 shines through in its end-of-year report despite annual per-share losses of $0.38 falling short of analyst projections. It\u2019s important to note that Rocket Lab, while not in the pre-revenue stage, is a burgeoning entity in the high-stakes realm of space exploration, trading current losses for the prospect of a tenfold increase in value.\n\nThis growth potential is clear from Rocket Lab\u2019s existing backlog or customer order tally, which more than doubled in 2023, reaching $1.04 billion, up from $582.4 million in 2022. Although immediate conversion of orders into profits isn\u2019t feasible, the company\u2019s substantial backlog provides a glimpse into its future cash flow. Rocket Lab anticipates recognizing nearly half of this total backlog as revenue within the next 12 months, potentially mitigating the impact of recent stock dilution in the short term.\n\nChegg Inc (CHGG) Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrading at just 6.5x earnings and 0.78x value, Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) stands out from other cheap stocks based on its current (under) valuation and its long-term growth trajectory that many Wall Street players are seemingly ignoring. This year, traditional learning institutions, including some of the most prestigious ones, faced increasing scrutiny and skepticism. I think artificial intelligence and the varied tech arising from increased remote work trends will trigger massive sea changes in how we go about education, with Chegg as one of the few recognizing the sector\u2019s latent strength.\n\nChegg is incorporating AI into various learning tools, with its new AI-powered personalized learning assistant based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 taking center stage. This innovation stands out as one of the EdTech sector\u2019s most successful, if not the sole, applications of such advanced AI tools.\n\nOf course, pioneering next-generation tools often come with high costs and unpredictability at the start of their lifecycle. While past ZIRP-era stocks may have overcome the cash crunch on sentiment and momentum alone, Chegg hasn\u2019t been quite as lucky. Consequently, Chegg\u2019s shares have fallen over 35% since the beginning of 2024, following an earnings report that fell short of expectations alongside a conservative outlook. Nevertheless, Chegg\u2019s management has framed this downturn as part of the R&D process for AI in EdTech, describing the development as \u201congoing and iterative.\u201d They have cautioned that it\u2019s too early to forecast a timeline for revenue and margin recovery due to R&D expenses. Still, at a low relative valuation and cheap stock status, Chegg is a moderate value play coupled with a long-term growth thesis.\n\nCheap Stocks to Buy: Valley National Bancorp (VLY) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

On the other hand, smaller regional banks with higher relative leverage and local real estate lending operations will finally be somewhat freed from oppressive borrowing rates and reduced consumer loan interest. And few regional banks stand out as quality cheap stocks as Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY).\n\nValley National\u2019s stock trades at a bottom-barrel 0.6x book value and 7x earnings, marking it as both undervalued and frequently overlooked. Its strong balance sheet and low debt load, evidenced by a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.56 compared to the industry average of 1.2, highlight the bank\u2019s relative lack of leverage compared to competitors. The bank\u2019s recent stock buyback initiative and a 5.97% trailing dividend yield further affirm its financial health.\n\nAnalysts generally regard Valley National as undervalued, with an average price target of $9.50 \u2014 about 25% above its present share price. Beyond the bullish outlook, broad sentiment surrounding the bank stock is on an uptick as 56% of analysts now recommend investors \u201chold\u201d Valley National, a massive improvement from the 50% who advised selling in the previous evaluation period.\n\nSamsara (IOT) Stocks to buy: A close-up shot of a hand pressing a \"BUY NOW!\" button on a laptop keyboard.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe term \u201cInternet of Things\u201d concept often evokes images of connected refrigerators and home alarm systems, but these consumer-facing examples barely scratch the surface of the broader IoT sector. Cheap stock Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is near the top of the wider IoT sector, expanding the IoT concept to serve enterprise and industrial operations better. The company focuses on fleets, transportation, and heavy equipment, aiming to streamline operational workflows, enhance movement tracking, and improve safety overall.\n\nIn its most recent report, Samsara celebrated a milestone year, achieving a 39% year-over-year increase in recurring revenue. The company also saw its recurring customer base grow by 49%, generating a solid $27 million in free cash flow. As a relatively young company introducing cutting-edge technology, Samsara\u2019s growth potential is untapped and unlimited. And, as both the company and tech mature, Samsara is set to snag greater market penetration as legacy businesses turn to new tech; management aims to expand its operational reach by targeting larger clients that are currently just beyond its grasp.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable businesses. For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed.\n\nGiven this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Samsara (NYSE:IOT) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. First, we'll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Samsara\n\nHow Long Is Samsara's Cash Runway?\n\nA company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. In February 2024, Samsara had US$548m in cash, and was debt-free. In the last year, its cash burn was US$23m. So it had a very long cash runway of many years from February 2024. Notably, however, analysts think that Samsara will break even (at a free cash flow level) before then. In that case, it may never reach the end of its cash runway. The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Well Is Samsara Growing?\n\nHappily, Samsara is travelling in the right direction when it comes to its cash burn, which is down 83% over the last year. Pleasingly, this was achieved with the help of a 44% boost to revenue. Considering these factors, we're fairly impressed by its growth trajectory. While the past is always worth studying, it is the future that matters most of all. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at our analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nHow Easily Can Samsara Raise Cash?\n\nWe are certainly impressed with the progress Samsara has made over the last year, but it is also worth considering how costly it would be if it wanted to raise more cash to fund faster growth. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash and fund growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsara's cash burn of US$23m is about 0.1% of its US$19b market capitalisation. So it could almost certainly just borrow a little to fund another year's growth, or else easily raise the cash by issuing a few shares.\n\nSo, Should We Worry About Samsara's Cash Burn?\n\nAs you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Samsara's cash burn. In particular, we think its cash runway stands out as evidence that the company is well on top of its spending. But it's fair to say that its revenue growth was also very reassuring. There's no doubt that shareholders can take a lot of heart from the fact that analysts are forecasting it will reach breakeven before too long. Taking all the factors in this report into account, we're not at all worried about its cash burn, as the business appears well capitalized to spend as needs be. An in-depth examination of risks revealed 3 warning signs for Samsara that readers should think about before committing capital to this stock.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company with better fundamentals, then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt or this list of stocks which are all forecast to grow.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0Jim Cramer Says You Should \u2018Buy, Buy, Buy\u2019 These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should \u2018Buy, Buy, Buy\u2019 These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program talked about CNBC's Alpha Stock Survey according to which a \u201cmajority\u201d of investors believe the market is headed for a pullback. Cramer is not at all worried about a possible decline in the market.\n\n\"Hallelujah about that survey,\" Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer said that the S&P 500 is up 10% in the first three months of 2024, registering the best quarter since 2019. This makes Cramer believe that the market is indeed heading for a pullback. But he said we should \u201cwelcome it, not fear it.\u201d\n\nJim Cramer \"Welcomes\" Market Sell-Offs\n\nJim Cramer said that sell-offs are \u201cinevitable.\u201d He said even though we don\u2019t know when they will hit, they are always expected and we should take them as buying opportunities. Cramer said he learned the concept of welcoming sell-offs from the legendary investor Peter Lynch, who famously said that you should expect a 10% pullback on average after every two years and a 25% \u201cbeatdown\u201d every six years. Peter Lynch, Cramer reminded, said about 30 years ago that despite pullbacks and sell-offs the market tends to do well in the long term since according to his estimates corporate profits grow 8% per year. Lynch said the stock market follows corporate earnings and as a result made almost accurate predictions about the Dow Jones growing at about 8% per year.\n\nCramer Thinks Market's \"Breadth Problem\" is Solved\n\nJim Cramer also said that anyone who still \u201cinsists\u201d that this market is just about major tech names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and other Mag. 7 stocks, they should rethink since he believes there are \u201cso many winners\u201d in the market that \u201cit\u2019s insane.\u201d Cramer believes the market no longer has the \u201cbreadth\u201d problem because returns are expanding across the board, sometimes at the \u201cexpense\u201d of mega-cap technology stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer thinks that it\u2019s of no use to stay fixated on the Federal Reserve for now, with all indications saying the central bank is in no hurry to cut interest rates. Cramer wants investors to instead focus on earnings and the performance of individual companies. Cramer said we haven\u2019t seen mass rounds of layoffs that many in the \u201chard landing\u201d camp were expecting. He said we are prepared to see another hot jobs report, but if it comes softer-than-expected, we will go into the next earnings season with a \u201cpleasant backdrop.\u201d Jim Cramer Says You Should \u2018Buy, Buy, Buy\u2019 These 11 Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC over the past few days and picked 11 stocks he recommended investors to buy. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nJim Cramer hit the \u2018Buy, Buy, Buy\u2019 button on LNG company New Fortress Energy Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:NFE)\u00a0during one of his recent programs on CNBC. Cramer said Wes Edens (New Fortress Energy Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:NFE)\u00a0CEO) is \u201cabsolutely terrific at what he does.\u201d Cramer said he likes the stock at the current levels.\n\n10. Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT). Here\u2019s what he said about the sock.\n\n\u201cOh my god, this is the hottest stock, it\u2019s gonna make money too.\u201d\n\nCramer said that Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT)\u00a0is a \u201cDevOps shop.\u201d Cramer said that it\u2019s a \u201chardware-software platform\u201d and people \u201clove these kinds of stocks\u201d and they cannot \u201clive without them.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT)\u00a0posted Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.04, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the period jumped 48.1% year over year to $276.27 million, beating estimates by $17.96 million.\n\n9. Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nJim Cramer thinks Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO) is a \u201cgreat company to buy here.\u201d Cramer said that this mineral company is a \u201cterrific\" and \"really good\" idea.\n\nOver the past one year Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock\u00a0(NYSE:RIO)\u00a0shares have gained about 4% over the past one year.\n\nEarlier this month, the stock was downgraded by Liberum to Hold from Buy amid softening demand and China-related concerns.\n\n8. Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nPennsylvania-based \u00a0optical materials and semiconductors company Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR)\u00a0is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to buy. Cramer said Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR)\u00a0has \u201ca lot of lasers, a lot of optics, a lot of good stuff.\u201d Cramer said Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR)\u00a0is \u201cgonna make money this year.\u201d He said investors should buy some of Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR)\u00a0stock now and then wait for the stock to come down to buy some more.\n\nIn addition to COHR, Cramer also likes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds had stakes in Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR).\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn addition to Diamondback Energy, we also initiated positions in\u00a0Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) and HCA Healthcare in Q4. Coherent supplies engineered materials and devices to semiconductor equipment companies, data center and telecom companies, and it also produces lasers for industrial applications. The company has a long history of successfully innovating in these areas and is well-positioned to benefit from demand for advanced transceivers as artificial intelligence (AI) investments increase. As near-term cyclical headwinds have weighed on the share price, we capitalized on what we view as an attractive price relative to our estimate of intrinsic value to initiate a position.\u201d\n\n7. Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nWhen asked about Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG), Cramer said that it\u2019s making money and since the stock has run a lot, investors should buy some of it now and then wait for a pullback before buying more.\n\nPure Storage\u00a0Inc (NYSE:PSTG)\u00a0shares have gained 50% year to date through March 29.\n\nDuring its earnings call last month, the company talked about shareholder returns and guidance:\n\n\"We have approximately $145 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization, and we are announcing today a new share repurchase authorization of $250 million. Now turning to our guidance for FY \u201925. We expect to return to double-digit revenue growth in FY \u201925, growing 10.5% to $3.1 billion. We expect demand across our entire data storage platform will strengthen while also remaining cautious of the macro spending environment. Our annual revenue guide of 10.5% growth also contemplates approximately 50% growth in TCV sales for our collective Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings, which are expected to be $600 million.\n\nTo help better understand the short-term impact that growth of our consumption and subscription offerings have on our annual revenue growth rate we estimate that our forecasted FY \u201925 revenue growth would be in the mid-teens when adjusting for the expected growth of both our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings. Slightly offset by expected additional revenue arising from past TCV sales in FY \u201924. Consistent with our philosophy in driving profitable growth, we expect FY \u201925 operating profit to be $532 million, and operating margin to be 17%. Margin for FY \u201925 is in line with our longer-term goal of expanding operating margin by a percentage point or 2 each year and represents a 2-point increase from our FY \u201924 guide that we communicated at the beginning of the year.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 39\n\nGenerators and power systems company Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is highly bullish on.

        "content": "Finding the next multi-bagger investment isn\u2019t as easy as staking all your cash on a Fabulous Four stock like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or playing it safe by index investing. Instead, the key to long-term, massive gains is finding speculative stocks with potential that the market is overlooking.\n\nIn a nutshell, you\u2019re like an investor buying into Nvidia in 2013 when shares traded in penny stock territory: you have a vision of the future and have found a speculative stock that fits that vision. More importantly, you have the conviction to wait out turbulence with massive gains on the horizon.\n\nWhile these stocks may not be the next Nvidia, each is cornering an important and emerging market with massive potential. As early movers in their respective spaces, these speculative stocks remain under the radar \u2014 for now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBraze (BRZE) Writing note showing Content Marketing. Business photo showcasing involves creation and sharing of online material.\n\nSource: Artur Szczybylo via Shutterstock\n\nManaging marketing in today\u2019s digital creator economy is tough when you consider the many platforms, customer expectations across channels, and sheer scope of a well-integrated marketing campaign. Braze (NASDAQ:BRZE) is a speculative stock that helps customers better manage marketing efforts. Shockingly, most investors don\u2019t have this mid-cap speculative stock on their radar even though it boasts mega-clients like Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), NASCAR and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU).\n\nIn a nutshell, Braze leverages user data to better personalize advertising across platforms. It creates a coherent thread for the potential customer while helping the advertiser track spending and return on ad sales more efficiently. Braze is also one of the few companies effectively using customer-facing artificial intelligence (AI) integration tools. That\u2019s in contrast to companies slapping an \u201cAI\u201d label on anything and everything with a hint of automation, whether or not the label is appropriate.\n\nA newer company expanding as rapidly as possible, Braze isn\u2019t yet turning a profit. But the company\u2019s strong revenue growth, high subscription revenue rate (95%) and a notable client book prove this speculative stock has a bright future. Even if it remains under the radar for now.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe \u201cInternet of Things\u201d is a well-known trope by now, but for many the phrase conjures up thoughts of connected refrigerators and home alarm systems. While valid, those are just a slice of the overall IoT sector. However, speculative stock Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is scaling the concept to serve enterprise and industrial operations more effectively. Samsara primarily targets fleet, transportation and heavy equipment to manage operational workflows, track movement and improve overall safety.\n\nSamsara just marked a record-setting year in its most recent report, nailing 39% year-over-year (YoY) recurring revenue growth. Recurring customer counts climbed 49% and brought in a respectable $27 million in free cash flow. Most importantly, Samsara is a relatively new firm bringing an equally nascent tech to market. It means the firm\u2019s upward possibilities are endless as they increase market penetration and begin scaling to meet growing clients by targeting the bigger fish currently just out of their reach.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) ecommerce company nogin, NOGN stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGlobalized, direct-to-consumer e-commerce is as popular as ever post-pandemic, with giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) leading the way. GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) operates similarly but carves out its niche by focusing on the vast B2B market. It aims to be the ultimate platform for businesses to source products and handle all related vendor, product and sourcing management tasks.\n\nMedium-sized businesses often struggle with product and inventory management, sourcing and payment processing. GigaCloud provides a comprehensive suite of services tailored for the scaled B2B e-commerce market, including a vibrant vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment and notably, secure cross-border payment facilitation.\n\nThe company\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio stands out for its low value, at just 19x, starkly contrasting with the tech sector\u2019s average ratio of 36x. This disparity becomes even more pronounced when considering GigaCloud\u2019s earnings growth, which saw earnings per share double over the past four quarters. Moreover, the company maintains robust free cash flow per share and trades at an exceptionally low 0.68x sales, highlighting its status as a highly undervalued speculative stock in today\u2019s market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in BRZE.

        "title": "Samsara Inc. (NYSE:IOT) Analysts Are Pretty Bullish On The Stock After Recent Results",
        "content": "Shareholders of Samsara Inc. (NYSE:IOT) will be pleased this week, given that the stock price is up 12% to US$39.16 following its latest full-year results. The results don't look great, especially considering that statutory losses grew 29% toUS$0.54 per share. Revenues of US$937m did beat expectations by 2.0%, but it looks like a bit of a cold comfort. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Samsara  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Samsara's 14 analysts is for revenues of US$1.19b in 2025. This reflects a sizeable 27% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. The loss per share is expected to greatly reduce in the near future, narrowing 24% to US$0.40. Before this earnings announcement, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$1.16b and losses of US$0.41 per share in 2025. So there seems to have been a moderate uplift in analyst sentiment with the latest consensus release, given the upgrades to both revenue and loss per share forecasts for this year.\n\nThe consensus price target rose 16% to US$40.82, with the analysts encouraged by the higher revenue and lower forecast losses for next year. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Samsara at US$47.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$31.00. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that Samsara's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 27% annualised growth rate until the end of 2025 being well below the historical 38% p.a. growth over the last three years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 12% annually. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Samsara is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts reconfirmed their loss per share estimates for next year. Pleasantly, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Samsara going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here..\n\nThat said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 3 warning signs  with Samsara , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Samsara Inc. (NYSE:IOT)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Samsara fair value estimate is US$43.63 Current share price of US$39.16 suggests Samsara is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$40.82 analyst price target for IOT is 6.4% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nHow far off is Samsara Inc. (NYSE:IOT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Samsara\n\nIs Samsara Fairly Valued?\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$22.7m US$60.1m US$136.5m US$273.9m US$488.1m US$795.0m US$1.04b US$1.28b US$1.49b US$1.68b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x6 Analyst x7 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 31.43% Est @ 22.69% Est @ 16.57% Est @ 12.28% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%  US$21.2 US$52.6 US$112 US$210 US$350 US$533 US$656 US$753 US$821 US$862\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.4b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$1.7b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.3%) = US$37b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$37b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$19b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$24b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$39.2, the company appears about fair value at a 10% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Samsara as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.999. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Samsara\n\nStrength\n\nCurrently debt free.\n\nWeakness\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nForecast to reduce losses next year.\n\nHas sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.\n\nCurrent share price is below our estimate of fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nNot expected to become profitable over the next 3 years.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Samsara, we've put together three fundamental items you should look at:\n\nRisks: For instance, we've identified  3 warning signs for Samsara that you should be aware of.

(NYSE:IOT) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript March 7, 2024\n\nSamsara Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Samsara's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call.

A data analyst wearing virtual reality goggles while analyzing on-board telematics.\n\nSanjit Biswas: Thanks, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Samsara's FY '24 was another year of durable and efficient growth. We ended FY '24 with an ARR of $1.1 billion, growing 39% year-over-year. During the year we added 611 customers into our $100,000-plus ARR cohort, bringing us to 1,848 large customers in total. Our momentum reflects the continued strength of our platform and the large market opportunity ahead of us. Several factors drove our execution. First, we are addressing a large market that's early in its digitization journey. Our customers represent the industries that drive more than 40% of the global GDP and are the backbone of the economy. Second, we pioneered the Connected Operations Cloud, a singular system of record for physical operations to address this market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThird, we have built a multi-application platform that solve our customers' most challenging problems. We have a unique IoT dataset that includes data from a broad and diverse group of vehicles, equipment, sites, and workers. It is also fed by growing ecosystem of connected assets and third-party systems. And last, our increasing scale and strong unit economics, drive operational efficiency. While we're still in the early innings of our customers' digitization journeys, we are proud of our progress and impact so far. In just eight years of selling, we are operating at a rare combination of scale, growth, and profitability. We are the strategic partner to many of the world's leading and most complex physical operations organizations. And our large customer momentum continues to fuel our growth.\n\nWe provide visibility into their operations and deliver clear ROI with payback periods often measured in months. Q4 was a milestone quarter for our large customers. We added a record 185 customers into $100,000-plus ARR cohort. This represents our fastest-growing customer group. We also added a record 11 customers into our $1 million-plus ARR cohort. I'd like to share two examples from this quarter that show our momentum with large customers. The first is with USIC, which is our largest new logo and our largest net new ACV deal ever. USIC is the leading provider of underground public utility locating services with more than 12,000 technicians in 48 states. Their technicians mark utility lines to ensure public safety and to protect and maintain our critical infrastructure.\n\nSee also 16 Best Future Stocks For The Long Term and 21 Countries that Have the Highest Rates of Cancer Deaths.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

This compares to loss of $0.02 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 33.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.04, delivering a surprise of 300%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nSamsara Inc. , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, posted revenues of $276.27 million for the quarter ended January 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.85%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $186.58 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nSamsara Inc. Shares have lost about 0.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Samsara Inc.\n\nWhile Samsara Inc. Has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Samsara Inc. Mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is breakeven on $265.46 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.10 on $1.17 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Software is currently in the top 19% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, nCino (NCNO), has yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2024. The results are expected to be released on March 26.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +200%.

        "content": "Samsara & USIC (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, March 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Samsara Inc. (\"Samsara\") (NYSE: IOT), the pioneer of the Connected Operations\u2122 Cloud, today announced USIC, the leader in underground utility damage prevention, selected Samsara to digitize its operations and enable improvements in safety, efficiency, and sustainability. USIC leverages Samsara Video-Based Safety, Panic Button, and Vehicle Telematics to enhance its safety program and gain efficiencies that can lead to timely service for its customers and reduced costs for the business.\n\nTwenty million miles of underground infrastructure connect the United States to the power, water, and communication services essential to every home and business. More than 12,000 USIC field service technicians operate across the nation, marking these utility lines to both protect and maintain this critical infrastructure and ensure public safety. USIC completes about 84 million projects annually, and demand for its services is growing as the U.S. population rises in rural regions and the government invests in new infrastructure projects.\n\n\"USIC is accelerating the massive infrastructure expansion happening from coast to coast. Bridging the digital divide by bringing Internet services to rural communities, establishing new underground power lines so the lights stay on when a storm surges, and much more \u2013 this is all important work for our nation\u2019s future,\" said Richard Batelaan, Chief Operating Officer at USIC. \"With the real-time data we receive from Samsara, we can do this work safely and effectively. Samsara\u2019s technology is essential to keeping our technicians out of harm\u2019s way and delivering the services our customers need to keep their communities running.\"\n\nProtecting Thousands of Technicians with a Technology-Driven Safety Program\n\nUSIC is on a journey to reach zero safety incidents and zero injuries. Its focus is eliminating at-risk behaviors, strengthening its Safe-Life culture, and equipping employees with new training and tools. Samsara Video-Based Safety enables USIC to better support and coach its technicians on the road through real-time incident detection and preventative in-cab coaching.

In its pilot with Samsara, USIC reduced mobile phone usage by 92%, no seat belt instances by 85%, and rolling stops by 50%.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Increasing safety for our technicians behind the wheel is critical as crashes are the number one risk they face,\" said Tom Karnowski, Vice President of Environment, Health, and Safety at USIC. \"We evaluated other vendors but right off the bat, it was clear the safety improvements we could make with Samsara.

With its previous provider, this data was delayed by 20 minutes, causing unnecessary pauses in action.\n\n\"For our customers, minutes and even seconds matter. Maneuvering our workforce to the right place quickly, especially during emergencies, means trust in knowing where people are, where they were, and where they can go next. That\u2019s where Samsara\u2019s strength as a unified platform comes into play,\" said Karnowski. \"With Samsara\u2019s platform, we can see the bigger picture of what\u2019s happening in our operations and make adjustments throughout the day.

For the first quarter and fiscal year 2025, Samsara expects the following:\n\nQ1 FY2025 Outlook FY 2025 Outlook Total revenue $271 million \u2013 $273 million $1,186 million \u2013 $1,196 million Year/Year revenue growth 33% \u2013 34% 27% \u2013 28% Year/Year adjusted revenue growth (1) 29% \u2013 30% Non-GAAP operating margin (3%) 2% Non-GAAP net income per share, diluted $0.00 \u2013 $0.01 $0.11 \u2013 $0.13\n\n(1) Q4 FY24 was a 14-week fiscal quarter instead of a typical 13-week fiscal quarter. To enable comparability across periods, adjusted revenue and adjusted revenue growth rate are calculated by multiplying Q4 FY24 revenue by 13/14 to remove the impact of an additional week of revenue recognition in Q4 FY24.\n\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance financial measures to corresponding GAAP guidance financial measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and potential variability of expenses, such as stock-based compensation expense-related charges, that may be incurred in the future and cannot be reasonably determined or predicted at this time. It is important to note that these factors could be material to our results of operations computed in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAbout Samsara\n\nSamsara is the pioneer of the Connected Operations\u2122 Cloud, which is a platform that enables organizations that depend on physical operations to harness Internet of Things (IoT) data to develop actionable insights and improve their operations.

These statements may relate to, but are not limited to, expectations of future operating results or financial performance, the calculation of certain of our key financial and operating metrics, our market opportunity, industry developments and trends, customer demand for our solution, macroeconomic conditions and any expected benefits of our products, and our competitive position, as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing.\n\nForward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and could cause actual results and events to differ. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"contemplate,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"goal,\" \"guidance,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"objective,\" \"ongoing,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"seek,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" or the negative of these terms or other comparable expressions that concern our expectations, strategies, plans, or intentions. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved, if at all. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made, including information furnished to us by third parties that we have not independently verified, and/or management\u2019s good faith beliefs and assumptions as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this press release may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\n\nThese risks and uncertainties include our ability to retain customers and expand the Applications used by our customers, our ability to attract new customers, our future financial performance, including trends in revenue and annual recurring revenue, net retention rate, costs of revenue, gross profit or gross margin, operating expenses, customer counts, non-GAAP financial measures (such as adjusted revenue, adjusted revenue growth rate, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, free cash flow margin, and adjusted free cash flow margin), our ability to achieve or maintain profitability, the demand for our products or for solutions for connected operations in general, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, geopolitical tensions involving China, the conflict in Israel and Gaza, the emergence of pandemics and epidemics, and macroeconomic conditions globally on our and our customers\u2019, partners\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 operations and future financial performance, possible harm caused by silicon component shortages and other supply chain constraints, the length of our sales cycles, possible harm caused by a security breach or other incident affecting our or our customers\u2019 assets or data, our ability to compete successfully in competitive markets, our ability to respond to rapid technological changes, and our ability to continue to innovate and develop new Applications. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\n\nExcept as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis document includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP are included at the end of this press release following the accompanying financial data.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. In addition, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not reflect our future contractual commitments or the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period. These and other limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\n\nWe present these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing Samsara\u2019s operating results through the eyes of management and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to evaluate our business.\n\nExpenses Excluded from Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u2014Stock-based compensation expense is excluded primarily because it is a non-cash expense that management believes is not reflective of our ongoing operational performance. Employer taxes on employee equity transactions, which is a cash expense, is excluded because such taxes are tied to the timing and size of the vesting of the underlying equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting, which may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business. Lease modification, impairment, and related charges, and legal settlements are excluded because management believes that such charges are not reflective of our ongoing operational performance.\n\nOperating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\u2014We define ARR as the annualized value of subscription contracts that have commenced revenue recognition as of the measurement date.\n\nAdjusted Revenue / Adjusted Revenue Growth\u2014Q4 FY24 was a 14-week fiscal quarter instead of a typical 13-week fiscal quarter. To enable comparability across periods, adjusted revenue and adjusted revenue growth rate are calculated by multiplying Q4 FY24 revenue by 13/14 to remove the impact of an additional week of revenue recognition in Q4 FY24.\n\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin\u2014We define non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense-related charges, including employer taxes on employee equity transactions, included in cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of total revenue. We use non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations.\n\nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin\u2014We define non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, or non-GAAP operating income (loss), as income (loss) from operations excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense-related charges, including employer taxes on employee equity transactions, lease modification, impairment, and related charges, and legal settlements. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of total revenue. We use non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP operating margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP operating margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share\u2014We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense-related charges, including employer taxes on employee equity transactions, lease modification, impairment, and related charges, and legal settlements. Our non-GAAP net income (loss) per share\u2013basic is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Our non-GAAP net income per share\u2013diluted is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (stock options, restricted stock units, and shares issued under our 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan) to the extent they are dilutive. Non-GAAP net loss per share\u2013diluted is the same as non-GAAP net loss per share\u2013basic as the inclusion of all potential dilutive common stock equivalents would be antidilutive. We use non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin\u2014We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities reduced by cash used for purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of total revenue. We believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin, even if negative, are useful in evaluating liquidity and provide information to management and investors about our ability to fund future operating needs and strategic initiatives.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin\u2014We define adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow excluding the cash impact of non-recurring capital expenditures associated with the build-out of our corporate office facilities in San Francisco, California, net of tenant allowances, and legal settlements. Adjusted free cash flow margin is calculated as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of total revenue. We believe that adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow margin, even if negative, are useful in evaluating liquidity and provide information to management and investors about our ability to fund future operating needs and strategic initiatives by excluding the impact of non-recurring events.\n\nWebcast Information and Shareholder Letter\n\nAn investor presentation and accompanying shareholder letter is accessible from the Samsara investor relations website at https://investors.samsara.com/.

        "content": "Motive Technologies filed a countersuit Thursday in federal court against its fleet tech rival Samsara Inc. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nFleet telematics provider Motive Technologies is firing back at rival Samsara Inc., filing a lawsuit alleging Samsara copied and used its proprietary technology and patents, including AI dashcam technology.\n\nMotive\u2019s lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, \u201calleges that for years, Samsara has engaged in unlawful, anticompetitive business practices to copy Motive\u2019s products and technology and to steal its intellectual property.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur action against Samsara stems from their unlawful and anticompetitive business practices, including patent infringement, fraud, false advertising, and theft of Motive\u2019s trade secrets, among other things,\u201d Motive co-founder and CEO Shoaib Makani said in a statement to FreightWaves. \u201cMotive has spent years developing AI to prevent accidents and make our roads safer. Samsara hasn\u2019t been able to build competitive AI solutions and is losing large enterprise customers to Motive as a result. Instead of building a better product, Samsara has resorted to IP theft and anticompetitive practices in an attempt to close the gap.\u201d\n\nThe suit also accuses Samsara employees of creating more than 30 fake Motive accounts on its platform, according to the website truthandsafety.com, which was set up by Motive to dispute Samsara\u2019s legal claims.\n\nIn a statement, Samsara disputes the allegations lodged by Motive in its complaint.\n\n\u201cRather than stopping its unlawful conduct, Motive has decided to copy our claims,\u201d Adam Simons, a Samsara spokesperson, said in a statement to FreightWaves. \u201cAs demonstrated in our complaint, this is the same copycat tactic Motive uses for its product development. The allegations in Motive\u2019s suit are a deliberate distraction, and we have every confidence in our defense. We remain focused on putting an end to Motive\u2019s ongoing infringement and unlawful conduct to ensure fair competition, innovation, and safety for the entire industry.\u201d\n\nOngoing legal fight\n\nThe move comes nearly three weeks after Samsara filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Motive, formerly KeepTruckin, alleging Motive copied and used its proprietary technology, engaged in false and misleading advertising, and created fictitious accounts to gain access to Samsara\u2019s connected vehicle platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth technology companies, headquartered in San Francisco, offer telematics products, including ELDs and dashcams for the transportation and logistics industry.\n\nIn a statement about the original lawsuit, Motive called the legal actions taken by Samsara \u201cmeritless and anticompetitive.\u201d\n\nSamsara files second complaint against Motive\n\nSamsara filed a second complaint against Motive on Feb. 9 with the U.S. International Trade Commission regarding some of Motive\u2019s products. According to a Samsara spokesperson, the suit \u201cseeks an exclusion order to prevent Motive\u2019s Vehicle Gateway and Dashcam products from being imported into the United States and a cease and desist order to prohibit Motive from selling, marketing, advertising, or distributing its Vehicle Gateway and Dashcams on the grounds that these products infringe certain of Samsara\u2019s patents.\u201d\n\nMotive is embroiled in a legal fight against another safety and fleet technology provider, Omnitracs, which filed suit against the telematics provider in October. The lawsuit centers on 11 patents that Omnitracs says Motive copied from Omnitracs.\n\nDo you have a news tip to share? Send me an email or message me @cage_writer on X, formerly Twitter.

In 2022, Motive raised a funding round that valued the company at $2.85 billion.\n\nA Samsara spokesperson in a statement called the lawsuit \"the same copycat tactic Motive uses for its product development.\"\n\n\"Rather than stopping its unlawful conduct, Motive has decided to copy our claims,\" the Samsara spokesperson said.\n\nIn January, Samsara filed a lawsuit against Motive in federal court in Delaware, saying Motive employees accessed its platform more than 20,000 times between 2018 and 2022. The complaint included a screenshot from a Samsara dashcam that allegedly shows Makani and another executive studying its technology. Samsara went public in 2021 with venture capital backing from Andreessen Horowitz. (Reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

In 2022, Motive raised a funding round that valued the company at $2.85 billion.\n\nA Samsara spokesperson in a statement called the lawsuit \"the same copycat tactic Motive uses for its product development.\"\n\n\"Rather than stopping its unlawful conduct, Motive has decided to copy our claims,\" the Samsara spokesperson said.\n\nIn January, Samsara filed a lawsuit against Motive in federal court in Delaware, saying Motive employees accessed its platform more than 20,000 times between 2018 and 2022.\n\nThe complaint included a screenshot from a Samsara dashcam that allegedly shows Makani and another executive studying its technology. Samsara went public in 2021 with venture capital backing from Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n(Reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

        "title": "3 Strong Buy IoT Stocks to Add to Your February Must-Watch List",
        "content": "With the massive embrace of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the past year, many other technologies have faded into the background. Perhaps only I think the Internet of Things (IoT) doesn\u2019t have the same cachet it once did, as not nearly as many investors are Googling \u201cStrong Buy IoT Stocks,\u201d as they once did.\n\nDespite IoT being displaced as a vital tech innovation, the Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR) has managed to hang on to $279 million of its net assets. Global X launched the ETF in September 2016, so it\u2019s now in its eighth year as a publicly traded investment vehicle. That says something about its staying power.\n\nSNSR tracks the performance of the Indxx Global Internet of Things Thematic Index, a collection of companies that stand to benefit from the broader adoption of IoT.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe cap-weighted ETF currently has 54 holdings. The top three industries by weight are semiconductors, telecommunications equipment and electrical products. I\u2019ll try to choose one from each of these industries.\n\nHere are my three IoT stocks to add to your February must-watch list.\n\nRambus (RMBS) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRambus (NASDAQ:RMBS) is the 7th-largest holding in SNSR with a 3.56% weighting. Its stock has appreciated by 445% over the past five years, nearly 6x the S&P 500.\n\nThe San Jose-based semiconductor company was founded in 1990, went public in 1997, and today generates more than $461 million in annual revenue. It makes money in three ways: 1) sales of memory interface chips, 2) silicon IP licenses, and 3) patent licenses.\n\nIn 2023, its product revenue accounted for 49% of its revenue,\u00a0while royalties from licensing accounted for the remaining 51%. Its gross margin in 2023 was nearly 78%, while its operating margin was 33.3%.\n\nUnfortunately, its Q4 2023 results weren\u2019t good enough for investors. Its shares lost 22% of their value on Feb. 6 and Feb. 7, erasing all their gains in 2024. That\u2019s what happens when the analyst estimate is $0.45 a share, and you deliver eight cents less.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt finished 2023 with cash and marketable securities of $425.9 million. Based on its current and long-term operating lease liabilities of $30.7 million, it had net cash of $395.2 million, or $3.59 a share. It trades at less than 15x cash per share.\n\nIn terms of IoT, the company provides both Interface IP and Security IP solutions to leading chipmakers for their SoC (system on chip) and FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) designs.\n\nBadger Meter (BMI)\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nBadger Meter (NYSE:BMI) is the 12th-largest holding in SNSR with a 2.46% weighting. Its stock has appreciated by 141% over the past five years, 1.7x the S&P 500.\n\nThe Wisconsin-based company manufactures smart-metering solutions that help water utilities, municipalities and commercial and industrial customers manage and measure water resources.\n\nAs far back as 2019, Badger focused on IoT and how it could help its clients\u2019 water metering.\n\n\u201cSmarter solutions, powered by cellular and IoT-based technologies, are rapidly transforming the water metering industry and helping water utilities face the serious challenges ahead,\u201d stated the company\u2019s Key Water Utility Trends for 2020 report.\n\nOne example of the products it provides organizations interested in monitoring their water use is the Remote Monitoring (RM) ArcGIS Connector, which, combined with the company\u2019s Telog family of IoT wireless data recorders, allows them to share data visualizations and analytics companywide.\n\nWater is an expense that every organization must bear. The proactive use of these solutions enables them to reduce costs while being good community citizens.\n\nBusiness was excellent in 2023.\n\nIts revenues jumped 24% to $704 million, with operating earnings of $118 million, 35% higher than in 2022. Its free cash flow was $98.1 million, or 106% of its net income. A percentage above 100 is always good.\n\nCharlie Munger loved companies that did good in their communities. Badger Meter does that many times over.\n\nSamsara (IOT) a person holding a cellphone with a cityscape in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSamsara (NYSE:IOT) is the 14th-largest holding in SNSR with a 2.39% weighting. Its stock has appreciated by 45% over the past five years, nearly half the S&P 500.\n\nHow could I not choose Samsara, given its stock symbol?\n\nOver the past year, it\u2019s been the underperformer of this trio of IoT stocks. However, its shares have done much better over the past year, up more than 117%, nearly 6x better than the index.\n\nHere\u2019s what Samsara\u2019s 2022 10-K says about IoT:\n\n\u201cOur Connected Operations Cloud consolidates data from our IoT devices and a growing ecosystem of connected assets and third-party systems, and makes it easy for organizations to access, analyze and act on data insights, using our cloud dashboard, custom alerts and reports, mobile apps and workflows,\u201d states pg. 6 of its 10-K.\n\nIn the 10-K, the company highlights several use cases of its Connected Operations Cloud. I especially liked the one about a large city government reducing its fleet\u2019s downtime by 28% by utilizing engine fault codes to provide more timely maintenance.\n\nThe best businesses make or save people or companies money and time. Samsara does both.\n\nIn its Q3 2024 results announced in late November, the company noted that 1,663 of its customers spent over $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR), 49% higher than a year earlier.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, it had an operating loss of $200.3 million through the first nine months of fiscal 2024. However, it lost $12.2 million on a non-GAAP basis, down from $62.3 million a year earlier.\n\nMost importantly, its ARR went over $1 billion for the first time in the third quarter. It reached this milestone in eight years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
