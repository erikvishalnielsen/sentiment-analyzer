        "content": "Data Storage Stocks Q1 Results: Benchmarking MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB)\n\nThe end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let\u2019s take a look at how MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) and the rest of the data storage stocks fared in Q1.\n\nData is the lifeblood of the internet and software in general, and the amount of data created is accelerating. As a result, the importance of storing the data in scalable and efficient formats continues to rise, especially as its diversity and associated use cases expand from analyzing simple, structured datasets to high-scale processing of unstructured data such as images, audio, and video.\n\nThe 5 data storage stocks we track reported an ok Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.9%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line with consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and while some of the data storage stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 4.3% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nWeakest Q1: MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB)\n\nStarted in 2007 by the team behind Google\u2019s ad platform, DoubleClick, MongoDB offers database-as-a-service that helps companies store large volumes of semi-structured data.\n\nMongoDB reported revenues of $450.6 million, up 22.3% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 2.4%. Despite the top-line beat, it was a weak quarter overall for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a miss of analysts' billings estimates.\n\n\"MongoDB's delivered solid first quarter results, highlighted by 32% Atlas revenue growth. At the same time, we had a slower than expected start to the year for both Atlas consumption growth and new workload wins, which will have a downstream impact for the remainder of fiscal 2025,\" said Dev Ittycheria, President and Chief Executive Officer of MongoDB. MongoDB Total Revenue\n\nMongoDB delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. The company added 85 enterprise customers paying more than $100,000 annually to reach a total of 2,137. The stock is down 17.2% since reporting and currently trades at $256.62.\n\nIs now the time to buy MongoDB?

        "title": "Is Now An Opportune Moment To Examine MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB)?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth of 16% on the NASDAQGM over the last few months. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at MongoDB\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for MongoDB\n\nIs MongoDB Still Cheap?\n\nGreat news for investors \u2013 MongoDB is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $373.66, but it is currently trading at US$253 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because MongoDB\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nCan we expect growth from MongoDB? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. MongoDB's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 77%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since MDB is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on MDB for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy MDB. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that MongoDB has 3 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in MongoDB, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Why I Sold These 7 Stocks: A Stock Portfolio Spring Cleaning",
        "content": "I'm not a very active stock trader, but my portfolio started to feel outdated recently. It was high time to collect profits from some longtime holdings, and to give up on a couple of unsuccessful ideas.\n\nSo I ran a late spring cleaning in my individual retirement account (IRA), closing out five stock holdings in their entirety and selling more than half of my shares in two other names. I tell you this not to necessarily mimic my actions, but more to perhaps learn something from them. Your mileage may vary, and I highly recommend doing your own research before taking any action in the stock market.\n\nBut for what it's worth, let me walk you through the decisions I made, one by one, starting with the partial sales.\n\nAmerican Tower: Sold 78% of my shares for a 50% return\n\nCell tower manager American Tower(NYSE: AMT)caught my eye in the fall of 2014. Back then, 4G wireless networks were new and hot, the company's international growth story was exciting, and the recently implemented real estate investment trust (REIT) structure brought promises of generous dividend payouts. At the same time, American Tower's reliable contracts generated rising revenues come rain or shine. Who wouldn't love a growth-hungry stock in the booming telecom sector, seemingly immune to economic downturns?\n\nThat thesis still sounds great on paper, but the real-world story is not so thrilling. The total return on my original investment (in two tranches) stopped at almost exactly 50% in a 10-year period. That's with reinvested dividends from the get-go. Over the same span, the S&P 500 market index notched a total return of 240%.\n\nI'm not giving up on American Tower right now. I'm just pocketing some profits in order to reinvest the cash in another long-term dividend master. If that means shoveling more cash into my Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) position with a 1.3% dividend yield, that's fine by me. Every diversified portfolio needs a robust foundation and the Vanguard fund serves that purpose to perfection. And I'm keeping a small American Tower stake, just in case the 6G wireless network generation delivers the tower profits its predecessors couldn't muster.\n\nCriteo: Sold 67% of my shares for a 322% return\n\nMy portfolio has heavy exposure to digital advertising specialists. I lowered that rewarding but risky imbalance by selling off two-thirds of my Criteo(NASDAQ: CRTO) shares at a juicy profit.\n\nThis position started in March 2020, a few days before the absolute bottom of the early COVID-19 market crash. The France-based digital ad campaigns manager was debt-free and flush with cash, and more than prepared to ride out a lengthy coronavirus pandemic. Criteo's stock had fallen 66% over the prior year when I made my move.\n\nStory continues\n\nCriteo's rebound didn't work out exactly as I had hoped. The online advertising sector as a whole took a deep dive in the inflation crisis of 2022, since ad buyers would rather hold on to their marketing budgets than try to convince an unusually price-sensitive consumer market. Despite lower top-line sales, Criteo never stopped pocketing free cash flows in this downturn.\n\nThis stock has more than quadrupled since I bought it, so my portfolio still holds a larger Criteo investment after a 67% sale than it did in the spring of 2020. These proceeds should go toward another thrilling growth stock, preferably outside the digital advertising industry.\n\nWestern Digital: Sold all shares for an 87% return\n\nThe rest of this list will address the stocks I'm completely done with -- for now, at least. They are presented here in the order of their effective return, from most to least profitable. The rundowns will be shorter and quicker since I no longer have investments in these stocks.\n\nThe first name on this list is data storage veteran Western Digital(NASDAQ: WDC). The maker of hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), and cloud storage solutions gave me an 87% total return on my investment, going back to June 2016. The stock looked undervalued at the time, hampered by a downturn in the storage industry but armed with the recent acquisition of SanDisk's SSD expertise.\n\nWestern Digital nearly doubled my money, but it took 8 years and the broader stock market ran miles ahead. The company no longer holds a unique advantage in the SSD market, as any digital storage expert worth its salt offers a large portfolio of SSD devices. My thesis on this stock arguably played out long before I considered selling those shares.\n\nAutodesk: Sold all shares for a 12% return\n\nNext up is Autodesk(NASDAQ: ADSK), an experienced giant in the digital design and content-creation software markets. It's the shortest holding period on this list, starting just two years ago on the notion that the Metaverse would become a game-changing business opportunity in short order.\n\nMaybe I'm jumping the gun here, but the metaverse trend from a couple of years ago is going nowhere in a hurry. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is still excited about this virtual world, but what else would you expect after renaming Facebook after this all-in market bet?\n\nThat's alright. If the Metaverse ever takes off, I'll have exposure to that opportunity through several other stocks and cryptocurrencies. I'll check up on Autodesk every now and then, but those reviews will be from Wall Street's sidelines for a while.\n\nMongoDB: Sold all shares for a 9% return\n\nIf you're still with me, I made a minimal profit on next-gen database expert MongoDB(NASDAQ: MDB) in four years. This was another opportunistic grab in the COVID-19 crash, and I've lost patience with this erratic stock.\n\nMongoDB's stock has drifted sideways for years while the roster of credible rivals kept growing. Even database traditionalist Oracle sells non-relation databases in the cloud these days. This company's technical leadership is falling apart. I'm happy to get my original investment back, ready for a new home in a fresher high-growth opportunity.\n\nNokia: Sold all shares for a 3% return\n\nEverything I said about American Tower applies to Nokia(NYSE: NOK) as well. Furthermore, the Finnish telecom equipment and services veteran faces regulatory challenges in China and other key markets. Sure, the company is designing high-speed data networks for the moon, but that won't be a game-changing revenue stream for decades to come.\n\nSo I'll step away from Nokia for now. Wake me up if the company ever gets on friendly terms with governments and regulators in Beijing.\n\nEdgio: Sold all shares for a 92% loss\n\nLast and least, I lost almost everything in my Edgio investment. Formerly known as Limelight Networks, the edge computing and content delivery network operator once looked like a misunderstood and undervalued growth story.\n\nWell, I was wrong about Edgio. The company has been burning cash for years, despite a supposedly game-changing merger with Yahoo!'s Edgecast content delivery network. Sales are up, profits are down, the stock is nearly worthless, and I'm done with Edgio. I'm left with just 8.2% of my original investment in this case, so it's good that I made this fairly speculative investment a small one.\n\nIs it time for a portfolio review?\n\nThat's my stock portfolio's delayed spring cleaning, for better or for worse. I hope you learned something useful, or that you at least got a chuckle over my worst mistakes.\n\nWhat about you? Have you done any portfolio cleaning lately? It's always a good idea to check if your investments are performing as expected and still fit your financial strategy. Whether you're making big moves or just a few tweaks, a tidy portfolio can make for a happier investor. And maybe you'll catch your own weak spots much earlier than I did here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been beating the AI drum and thinks the AI \u201cparty\u201d is just getting started, wrote that the $4 trillion AI arms race is between major tech players and GPU chips have become the new oil or gold in the tech industry.\n\nIves wrote that he thinks NASDAQ will have another strong second half of the year.\n\n\u201cTech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand.\u201d\n\nWhile Ives continues to see the major tech stocks leading the AI market, he thinks the AI-led rally can broaden out to tech companies who have strong \u201cinstalled\u201d bases which can actually use generative AI applications and models.\n\nLast month, while talking to CNBC, Ives said that the tech bull market is going to last for at least two more years. When asked what could be the threat to this bull run, Ives said that China could be a threat amid a possibility of \u201ctech cold war\u201d but he thinks that is a \u201ccontained threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt started off with the semis, but now it\u2019s started to happen is, the demand and the use cases\u201d are expanding to other companies. Ives called the AI boom the \u201cfourth industrial revolution.\u201d\n\nWe picked top AI stocks from Wedbush\u2019s latest note. The firm named some of these stocks as the best picks for the second half of 2024 while called others \u201coversold\u201d tech stocks. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) Best AI Stock for the Second Half of 2024?\n\nPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash\n\nMongodb Inc (NASDAQ:MDB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 56\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives recently said that several AI stocks including Mongodb are \u201cway oversold.\u201d\n\nMongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) is one of the stocks that will benefit from the \u201cAI party\u201d where the clock is still at \u201c9PM\u201d while the party is scheduled to go on until \u201c4AM,\u201d according to Dan Ives. Ives thinks MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) is one of the stocks that can profit from the AI revolution because of their \u201cmassive installed bases\u201d in both the enterprise and consumer spaces.\n\nStory continues\n\nMongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) shares plunged last month after the company posted Q1 results and gave a disappointing Q2 and full-year fiscal 2025 outlook. During the second quarter MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) expects revenue in the range of $460.0 million to $464.0 million vs. consensus of $471.54 million.\n\nDuring full fiscal 2025, MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) expects revenue in the range of $1.88 billion to $1.90 billion vs. consensus of $1.94 billion. Adjusted net income per share in the quarter is expected in the range of $2.15 to $2.30 vs. consensus of $2.43.\n\nAverage analyst price target set by Wall Street on MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB)\u00a0is $329.58, which presents a whopping 45% upside potential from the current levels. In the next year (fiscal 2026), MongoDB\u2019s earnings are expected to grow 34% while revenue growth is expected to come in at 17%, based on data from Yahoo Finance. Based on these growth catalysts, MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB)\u00a0bulls believe the stock\u2019s high forward P/E multiple of over 100 is justified. Canaccord Genuity David Hynes, who maintained a Buy rating on the stock but slashed his price target to $425 from $435, said that MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) is helping customers build AI-enabled applications. He thinks MongoDB should be bought on the dip, calling the stock a \u201cgenerational asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you can get a pullback of this size on a generational asset, you take it,\u201d Hynes added.\n\nClearBridge All Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the first quarter, we initiated a new position in\u00a0MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB), in the IT sector. The company offers a leading modern database platform that handles all data types and is geared toward modern Internet applications, which constitute the bulk of new workloads. Database is one of the largest and fastest-growing software segments, and we believe it is early innings in the company\u2019s ability to penetrate this market. MongoDB is actively expanding its potential market by adding ancillary capabilities like vector search for AI applications, streaming and real-time data analytics. The company reached non-GAAP profitability in 2022, and we see significant room for improved margins as revenue scales.\u201d\n\nOverall, MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100\u2019s (NDX) strong start to the year (up 21% year-to-date) has been led by the AI tech high flyers. Unless you\u2019re overconcentrated in the leading semiconductor firms, though, your portfolio is probably falling well shy of the Nasdaq 100. Indeed, it\u2019s tough to beat the market. In any case, there\u2019s no need to chase semiconductor stocks after a euphoric surge \u2014 not while there are Strong-Buy-rated, modestly-priced software stocks that have the means to heat up.\n\nThus, let\u2019s use TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to gauge three Strong Buy-rated software names\u2014INTU, SNPS, MDB\u2014that may still be overlooked.\n\nIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nIt did not take very long for shares of financial software firm Intuit to recover from its rapid correction in May. Over the past month alone, INTU stock has gained more than 14% as investors piled back into a name that may have the opportunity to raise prices by offering more value. Indeed, bookkeeping and accounting seem like a job fit for artificial intelligence (AI). And as Intuit refines its AI arsenal, it\u2019s hard to be anything less than bullish.\n\nLast month, Intuit acquired some technologies and assets from insurance technology company Zendrive. Indeed, Intuit is perhaps best known for its QuickBooks and Turbotax software, not insurance. However, what you may not know is that Credit Karma (owned by Intuit) has gotten into the auto insurance business via Karma Drive.\n\nWith Zendrive\u2019s tech and talent aboard, perhaps Karma Drive has what it takes to take its insurance foray to the next level as it embraces value from telematics and data analytics. Come for the credit score, stay for the great quote on a credit card, loans, and, now, car insurance. Investors seem to have viewed the Zendrive deal positively, with shares now flirting with 52-week highs again.\n\nAs Intuit becomes more of a data- and AI-driven company confident enough to expand into new markets (like insurance) as opposed to a mere financial software developer, perhaps the 60.3 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is warranted.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of INTU Stock?\n\nINTU stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 19 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average INTU stock price target of $733.28 implies 11.1% upside potential.\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS)\n\nShares of chip design software maker Synopsys are closing in on new highs again after a 20% surge since their April 2024 lows. All it took was a strong second-quarter earnings beat for the bulls to return to a name that stands to benefit greatly from the AI-driven semiconductor surge. Despite the loftier multiple, I\u2019m inclined to stay bullish on SNPS stock, given that its growth prospects seem to have gotten a whole lot better following its latest acquisition.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, Synopsys aims to close its $35 billion acquisition of engineering simulation software developer Ansys in the first half of next year. This move will bolster the firm\u2019s silicon-to-system design solution and help Synopsys become a more influential enabler of emerging technological innovations. Indeed, having simulations and chip designs under the same hood could help firms cut back on costs and risks involved with tackling complex, forward-thinking engineering projects.\n\nThe deal isn\u2019t a sure thing, though, not after Chinese anti-trust authorities look into the implications of a Synopsys-Ansys deal. Shares of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) have fallen around 10% since the deal was announced back in December 2023 due to uncertainties about whether the deal will fall through.\n\nEither way, Synopsys is already playing chess while others are playing checkers. With an impressive Synopsys.ai suite of tools and analytics solutions that harness the full power of data, perhaps the hefty 65.8 times trailing P/E (way more than the Infrastructure Software industry average of 42.2 times) is worth paying up for.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of SNPS Stock?\n\nSNPS stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 10 Buys assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average SNPS stock price target of $651.70 implies 7.7% upside potential.\n\nMongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB)\n\nShares of database software firm MongoDB have been under serious pressure this year, now down 47% from 52-week highs and off around 35% year-to-date. In any case, some big-name analysts see value in the name after the latest plunge. Despite the tough quarters and lower guidance contributing to MDB stock\u2019s slide, I remain bullish on MDB stock.\n\nMongoDB isn\u2019t the only enterprise software firm sagging lower, even as the Nasdaq 100 surges to new heights. However, it may be one of the first to make up for lost time as industry conditions normalize.\n\nLast week, analysts over at Citi (NYSE:C) praised MDB stock as one of their top two picks in the enterprise software scene. Citi highlighted multiple catalysts that could help MongoDB and other ailing enterprise software firms rise out of its funk. Most notably, Citi views recovering IT spending, lower rates, and seasonal factors as reasons to get behind MDB stock right here.\n\nIndeed, corporate budget cuts from 2022 have weighed heavily. More recently, perhaps enterprises are prioritizing AI hardware spending over software spending. Still, once the hardware is in place, it may be time to start spending on software again to make use of those shiny, new AI accelerators.\n\nSpecifically, MongoDB\u2019s AI Applications Program (MAAP) stands out as an intriguing generative AI-enabling platform for the enterprise. With the backing of big names in AI, like Anthropic, and some of the Magnificent Seven public cloud giants, perhaps investors are underestimating the firm\u2019s ability to benefit from the catalysts Citi outlined.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of MDB Stock?\n\nMDB stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 20 Buys and four Holds assigned in the past three months. The average MDB stock price target of $335.95 implies 26.8% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI-enabling software companies may be standing in the shadows of semiconductor firms right now. Only time will tell if the euphoric gains will shift into the software space in the second half of the year. Regardless, Wall Street\u2019s enthusiasm for each stock is tough to ignore. Of the three names, Wall Street sees the most upside potential (26.8%) in MDB stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "When it rains, it pours. However, the storm will eventually pass. Accordingly, investors that are able to identify solid businesses that have the staying power to emerge stronger from the storm can certainly outperform. Indeed, I think it\u2019s possible to realize triple-digit gains, as many did during the 2022 selloffs, from picking such stocks\n\nThe circumstances are very much different in 2024. It\u2019s very difficult to find quality companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) at $90 these days. That said, there are still many other quality companies that are trading at bargain-basement levels. Such companies are my focus \u2013 the ones that can make a similar comeback over the next few years. We\u2019re near a shift in economic policy, and this could catalyze a breakout over the next few years.\n\nI think these three undervalued stocks will be among the top beneficiaries of shifting market trends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMongoDB (MDB) An image of different overlaid data charts\n\nSource: solarseven/Shutterstock\n\nMongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) is a leading database platform company. Despite MDB stock plunging by a staggering 42% from mid-May to mid-June, I believe the selloff is majorly overdone. Currently, the stock appears to offer compelling value.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s crucial to note that MongoDB\u2019s steep decline came despite the company beating both top and bottom-line estimates in its latest quarter. MongoDB posted Q1 FY2025 adjusted earnings per share of 51 cents, handsomely surpassing consensus by 11 cents. Revenues also climbed by an impressive 22.3% year-over-year to $450.56 million, exceeding expectations by $10.9 million.\n\nThe primary culprit behind Wall Street\u2019s severe punishment of this stock was MongoDB\u2019s lowered outlook. The company trimmed its full-year sales guidance to $1.89 billion, down from the $1.915 billion projected in March. Similarly, adjusted earnings are now anticipated at $2.23 per share, a reduction from the earlier $2.38 forecast.\n\nHowever, I firmly believe the market\u2019s reaction is a clear overreaction. MDB stock has already rebounded nearly 20% from its mid-June trough, and I expect this recovery to gain further momentum. If MongoDB continues its streak of beating estimates and increasing guidance, the stock could be poised for an even more jaw-dropping breakout.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) luv stock\n\nSource: Ryan Fletcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nSouthwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) operates as a passenger airline carrier, providing scheduled air transportation services in the U.S. and international markets. While airline stocks are anything but rosy right now (as they grapple with the post-pandemic debt hangover and steep interest rate hikes), Southwest\u2019s first quarter results suggest glimmers of hope on the horizon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company achieved record Q1 operating revenues and passenger numbers, marking eight straight quarters of top-line records. Managed business revenues surged an impressive 25% year-over-year. And Southwest\u2019s trailing 12-month revenue in Q1 2024 posted a towering surge, coming in $4.3 billion higher than pre-pandemic levels in Q4 2019. Notably, the airline\u2019s fleet has also continued to grow. undervalued stocks: southwest airlines total aircraft\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHowever, the crux of the issue lies in translating this revenue recovery into bottom-line profitability via margin expansion. As interest rates eventually moderate, Southwest should see much-needed relief on its interest expenses. I believe Southwest is far from dead in the water. The building blocks are there for a jaw-dropping breakout in the years ahead as the company polishes their operations and interest rates become more favorable. The current turbulence is undoubtedly significant. But Southwest seems poised to weather the storm.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a global pharmaceutical giant delivering innovative medicines and vaccines. Indeed, Pfizer was the among greatest pandemic darlings. But this narrative has been crushed as the music stopped.\n\nCoronavirus vaccines are highly politicized and are a thing of the past. Many people believed these companies would see recurring sales from people permanently taking booster shots every six months, as vaccine manufacturers and the health departments of certain countries recommended. That definitely did not happen. As such, PFE stock has been treated as a one-trick pony, with the stock down 52% from its peak.\n\nHowever, I do think that a recovery is possible. The stock seems to be bottoming out. And when excluding sales Pfizer generated due to COVID-19 vaccines and medication, the business is reporting solid growth. In Q1 2024, Pfizer posted revenue of $14.88 billion, an 18.6% year-over-year decline. But this number still beat estimates by nearly $1 billion. The company\u2019s non-COVID portfolio delivered strong results, indicating the underlying business remains robust. Financials are clearly stabilizing, and look poised to continue improving again. PFE revenue EPS chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe company\u2019s oncology business should drive growth in the years to come, and Pfizer\u2019s Seagen acquisition might also contribute to future growth. Pfizer\u2019s pipeline progress gives me cautious optimism about its future prospects. I believe the worst may be over for PFE stock, as the company eyes a potential breakout.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Is MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) Best AI Stock Leading the \u2018Big Tech Race\u2019 to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst?\n\nAn entrepreneur presenting the latest technology innovation in electrical components.\n\nMongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 56\n\nMongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) is one of the stocks that will benefit from the \u201cAI party\u201d where the clock is still at \u201c9PM\u201d while the party is scheduled to go on until \u201c4AM,\u201d according to Dan Ives. Ives thinks MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) is one of the stocks that can profit from the AI revolution because of their \u201cmassive installed bases\u201d in both the enterprise and consumer spaces.\n\nMongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) shares plunged last month after the company posted Q1 results and gave a disappointing Q2 and full-year fiscal 2025 outlook. During the second quarter MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) expects revenue in the range of $460.0 million to $464.0 million vs. consensus of $471.54 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring full fiscal 2025, MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) expects revenue in the range of $1.88 billion to $1.90 billion vs. consensus of $1.94 billion. Adjusted net income per share in the quarter is expected in the range of $2.15 to $2.30 vs. consensus of $2.43.\n\nDespite the weak results, Wall Street continues to believe in the AI story of MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB). Stifel analysts Brad Reback and Robert Galvin said in a note that MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) faced headwinds amid a broader slowdown in the industry that caused a decline in consumption and workloads. The analysts said they continue to believe in the \u201cset of core and emerging AI growth drivers\u201d which can enable MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) to sustain a 20%+ revenue growth and strong cash flows in the near future.\n\nCanaccord Genuity David Hynes, who maintained a Buy rating on the stock but slashed his price target to $425 from $435, said that MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) is helping customers build AI-enabled applications. He thinks MongoDB should be bought on the dip, calling the stock a \u201cgenerational asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you can get a pullback of this size on a generational asset, you take it,\u201d Hynes added.\n\nAverage analyst price target set by Wall Street on MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB)\u00a0is $329.58, which presents a whopping 45% upside potential from the current levels. In the next year (fiscal 2026), MongoDB\u2019s earnings are expected to grow 34% while revenue growth is expected to come in at 17%, based on data from Yahoo Finance. Based on these growth catalysts, MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB)\u00a0bulls believe the stock\u2019s high forward P/E multiple of over 100 is justified.\n\nAlger Mid Cap Growth Fund stated the following regarding MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) is a scalable open-source database platform that allows developers to store, manage, and process structured. semi-structured and unstructured data generated by or feeding into the applications. Atlas, their cloud database-as-a-service platform, supports a comprehensive suite of core workloads, covering database, search, analytics and charts, and device sync. We believe the company is benefiting from a secular increase in demand for high-volume data storage driven by organizations needing to be able to store large amounts of data while still performing rapidly. During the quarter, the company reported strong fiscal fourth quarter results where revenues and operating profits beat analyst estimates, driven by strong growth in Atlas. However, shares fell after management issued forward revenue guidance that was below consensus estimates due to one-time items related to unused credits and multi-year upfront enterprise agreements. Nevertheless, we continue to believe the company is well positioned to become a best-in-class database management platform given its exposure to the secular increase in demand for high volume data storage solutions.\u201d\n\nOverall,\u00a0MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) ranks 11th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 12 Best AI Stocks Leading the \u2018Big Tech Race\u2019 to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst. While we acknowledge the potential of MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Shareholders May Be A Bit More Conservative With MongoDB, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MDB) CEO Compensation For Now",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nMongoDB will host its Annual General Meeting on 25th of June Salary of US$400.0k is part of CEO Dev Ittycheria's total remuneration Total compensation is similar to the industry average MongoDB's three-year loss to shareholders was 43% while its EPS grew by 18% over the past three years\n\nThe underwhelming share price performance of MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) in the past three years would have disappointed many shareholders. What is concerning is that despite positive EPS growth, the share price has not tracked the trend in fundamentals. The AGM coming up on the 25th of June could be an opportunity for shareholders to bring these concerns to the board's attention. They could also influence management through voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration. We think shareholders might be reluctant to increase compensation for the CEO at the moment, according to our analysis below.\n\nView our latest analysis for MongoDB\n\nComparing MongoDB, Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The Industry\n\nAt the time of writing, our data shows that MongoDB, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$16b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$15m for the year to January 2024. Notably, that's an increase of 15% over the year before. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at US$400k.\n\nIn comparison with other companies in the American IT industry with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, the reported median total CEO compensation was US$18m. So it looks like MongoDB compensates Dev Ittycheria in line with the median for the industry. Furthermore, Dev Ittycheria directly owns US$36m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.\n\nComponent 2024 2023 Proportion (2024) Salary US$400k US$400k 3% Other US$15m US$13m 97% Total Compensation US$15m US$13m 100%\n\nSpeaking on an industry level, nearly 22% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 78% is other remuneration. Investors may find it interesting that MongoDB paid a marginal salary to Dev Ittycheria, over the past year, focusing on non-salary compensation instead. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance. ceo-compensation\n\nA Look at MongoDB, Inc.'s Growth Numbers\n\nOver the past three years, MongoDB, Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 18% per year. Its revenue is up 29% over the last year.\n\nThis demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. Most shareholders would be pleased to see strong revenue growth combined with EPS growth. This combo suggests a fast growing business. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings..\n\nStory continues\n\nHas MongoDB, Inc. Been A Good Investment?\n\nFew MongoDB, Inc. shareholders would feel satisfied with the return of -43% over three years. Therefore, it might be upsetting for shareholders if the CEO were paid generously.\n\nIn Summary...\n\nMongoDB prefers rewarding its CEO through non-salary benefits. The fact that shareholders are sitting on a loss on the value of their shares in the past few years is certainly disconcerting. A huge lag in share price growth when earnings have grown may indicate there could be other issues that are affecting the company at the moment that the market is focused on. If there are some unknown variables that are influencing the stock's price, surely shareholders would have some concerns. The upcoming AGM will be a chance for shareholders to question the board on key matters, such as CEO remuneration or any other issues they might have and revisit their investment thesis with regards to the company.\n\nCEO compensation can have a massive impact on performance, but it's just one element. We've identified 3 warning signs for MongoDB that investors should be aware of in a dynamic business environment.\n\nArguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels. So check out this freelist of interesting companies that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

        "title": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, the AI thesis has lifted many technology stocks. However, software stocks have recently faced the perfect storm as investors price in the risk of AI disruption. Due to uncertainty, investors are throwing out the baby with the bathwater, presenting some cloud computing stocks to buy now.\n\nOver the past three months, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV) is down 3%, while the S&P 500 is up over 5%. The underperformance is due to the risks AI could pose to SaaS models. For instance, if AI automates repetitive tasks, it could negatively impact human resource management software stocks due to lower employee numbers.\n\nAlthough these challenges are real, some cloud computing stocks to buy now are well insulated from these risks. For example, database software stocks will benefit since data is the essential ingredient for AI, according to Altimeter\u2019s Brad Gerstner. With cloud computing stocks trading at a 20% discount to their historical multiple, it\u2019s time to be selective and buy these defensible business models.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nAfter a 20% drop over the past three months, this data lake and data warehouse provider is a buy. From a valuation perspective, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is trading at one of its lowest multiples since listing in September 2020. According to Seeking Alpha, it has a trailing twelve-month price-to-sales of 14 compared to the five-year average of 42.\n\nBased on the multiple compression, one would think that Snowflake\u2019s business prospects have declined materially. However, that\u2019s not the case. Instead, management believes that AI will enhance the capabilities of its data platform. For instance, it has developed Cortex AI to support customers in creating generative AI applications on top of their data.\n\nBy the end of Q1, Snowflake saw impressive adoption rates from customers. Over 750 customers were using Cortex AI. In addition, the company is developing other AI capabilities like Snowpark Container Services. Management expects these emerging AI products will be meaningful revenue contributors down the road.\n\nIn the short term, SNOW stock has diverged from its fundamentals. While product revenues accelerated in Q1 of 2025 to 34% year-over-year (YOY) compared to 33% in the previous quarter, the stock has fallen 20% since earnings. Consequently, its sales multiple is at a historic low, making it one of the top cloud computing stocks to buy now.\n\nStory continues\n\nMongoDB (MDB) A close-up view of the MongoDB (MDB) office in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) is another stock that has suffered due to the threat of AI and the risk of disruption. Year-to-date (YTD), the stock is down a whopping 44%. However, the markets are mistaken, and this stock should be on your cloud computing stocks to buy now list.\n\nEnter the bull case. Artificial intelligence needs a lot of data to train large language models. Indeed, to improve the models, large data sets of diverse data are required. Furthermore, in some cases, companies need domain-specific data or their own data to improve their AI applications. In short, there will be exponential growth in data requirements that will suit database providers like MongoDB.\n\nBesides AI, another growth driver for MongoDB is the migration from traditional relational databases to its document-based model. It has a 2% market share in an over $90 billion market, growing $10 billion to $15 billion annually. This presents a multi-year tailwind for MongoDB.\n\nResults show that this migration trend is ongoing. In Q1, Atlas, its database-as-a-service offering, grew revenues by 32% YOY. This cloud offering now accounts for 70% of total revenues. These results show solid execution, which will propel the stock higher as it gains market share.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Website of Adobe (ADBE) Firefly seen in an iPhone.

The impressive quarter put to bed investor fears. Adobe is one of the best creative tools and is well-positioned to grow.\n\nDespite the 14.5% rally on earnings, Adobe at $525 is still over 15% below its February 2 high of 634. In addition, ADBE stock is a bargain at 28 times forward non-GAAP earnings compared to its five-year average of 35. After this pullback and multiple compression, this is one of the best cloud computing stocks to buy.\n\nFurther, Adobe was down YTD on fears that image and video generation tools from ChatGPT and other AI tools would disrupt its creative suite. However, the earnings report revealed that Adobe is also innovating rapidly in this field. For instance, it has trained its Firefly generative AI models to deliver AI functionality in Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator and Lightroom.\n\nWall Street Analysts agree that Adobe is one of the top cloud computing stocks to buy. On earnings, Bank of America analysts reiterated their buy rating and $640 price target. They note that momentum in Digital Media and Experience businesses will drive the stock higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi had a long position in SNOW but did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is MongoDB, Inc. (MDB) a Good SaaS Stock to Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best SaaS Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) stands against the other SaaS stocks.\n\nSaaS, also known as software as a service, is one of the biggest and most important industries in today's high technology era. SaaS evolved along with personal computing, and initially, it allowed businesses to make use of software to manage their supply chains, manufacturing, and other business operations.\n\nSoftware as a service means that a SaaS customer simply needs access to a computer and the internet to use the service. Since the post broadband internet revolution, internet speed and bandwidth have increased to such an extent that consumers can easily stream high definition videos from the comfort of their homes. Simultaneously, businesses are also able to use third party software for functions such as payroll and human resource management. Relying on SaaS for entertainment or business management allows users to access a portfolio of specialized and customized services to suit their requirements without having to invest heavily in equipment or resources.\n\nAdditionally, the boom of artificial intelligence products means that SaaS is right at the front of the technological revolution. AI is, after all, software, and most AI users are unlikely to invest in expensive GPUs or hardware to run their models. Therefore, it's only natural that AI becomes an extension of SaaS, with models such as ChatGPT providing users globally with a novel software tool that they can use as they please.\n\nThe popularity of Software as a Service (SaaS) stocks has surged in recent years, driven by the widespread adoption of cloud-based solutions across industries. Products like Zoom have become essential tools for businesses, enhancing productivity, scalability, and cost-efficiency. This trend reflects the broader digital transformation that has been accelerated by the global shift to remote work and online services.\n\nMarc Andreessen's influential essay, \"Why Software Is Eating the World,\" published in 2011, foresaw this shift. Andreessen argued that software companies would revolutionize traditional industries by leveraging the internet's power to deliver innovative and scalable solutions. He predicted that every company would eventually become a software company, driven by the need to adapt to the digital age. Andreessen's vision has proven prescient as we witness the dominance of SaaS companies in the stock market. These firms offer subscription-based models that provide continuous revenue streams and foster long-term customer relationships. This business model has attracted investors due to its predictability and growth potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ability of SaaS firms and stocks to benefit from the Internet also means that the sector is quite lucrative. Market research shows that the global SaaS market was worth $276 billion in 2022. From then until 2032, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9% to be worth $1 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Individual SaaS stocks, like their broader technology peers, have also seen investors react to AI announcements. Those who have convinced Wall Street of their ability to blend AI into their product portfolios have flourished while others have floundered.\n\nFinally, and before we head to our list of the best SaaS stocks that hedge funds are buying, it's also important to understand how these stocks differ from others. Since SaaS is a high growth industry which prioritizes growth over profitability. Many SaaS businesses follow a \"land and expand\" strategy. This means acquiring a large customer base initially, even if it means sacrificing short-term profits. The idea is that once they have a sizable customer base, they can focus on increasing revenue from existing customers through upselling and cross-selling additional services. In certain competitive SaaS niches, achieving a dominant market share early on can also be crucial. By prioritizing rapid growth and user acquisition, SaaS companies can establish themselves as the leading player in their niche. This can create network effects, where the value of the platform increases as more users join, making it even more attractive to new customers. As a result, investors typically analyze SaaS firms through their revenue and enterprise value as opposed to their profitability. The enterprise value of a firm is an extension of its market value of equity as it adds the value of net debt that the firm has taken on. Net debt is total debt minus cash and equivalents, and for SaaS investors, one key metric is dividing the EV by the revenue. Generally, a higher EV/Revenue multiple suggests a more valuable company.\n\nThis multiple is also affected by interest rates. When interest rates rise, the discount rate used to value future cash flows also increases. This discount rate reflects the time value of money and the potential return investors could earn elsewhere. For high-growth stocks like SaaS companies, a large portion of their value is derived from the expectation of significant future earnings. A higher discount rate makes those future earnings less valuable in today's dollars, leading to a lower present value for the stock. When the interest rates were reduced to historically low levels during the pandemic, SaaS companies took off and traded at median EV/Revenue multiples of nearly 20 in 2021. Before the pandemic, the media EV/Revenue multiple for the publicly traded SaaS stocks was around 11.\n\nAfter the Fed increased short term interest rates to above 5% in 2022 and 2023, SaaS companies' EV/Revenue multiples contracted sharply. For the last 18 months, the median multiple is hovering around 7. Fed's interest rate policy shift is one reason for this decline; however, declining growth rates is another. SaaS companies used to grow their revenues by around 30% before the pandemic and this figure increased to 33% in 2021. However, we observed a sharp contraction in growth rates since then. Currently, the median revenue growth rate for publicly traded SaaS companies is around 17%.\n\nIt isn't just a coincidence that the growth rates of SaaS companies went down as the Fed increased interest rates. Higher interest rates make cost of capital expensive, and this leads to lower demand for capital spending. Higher interest rates also force unprofitable companies into cost cutting because they can't easily raise capital anymore. As a result, most SaaS companies, especially the ones that burn cash at high rates, switch from prioritizing growth to prioritizing profitability.\n\nWe believe we are at the end of the \"SaaS winter\" as the market expects the Fed to start cutting interest rates later in 2024. This means the dynamics that led to lower valuation multiples and lower growth rates for publicly traded SaaS stocks will reverse and we will see higher stock prices for SaaS stocks. The average return of hedge funds' favorite 10 SaaS stocks is -10% in 2024 and underperformed the market by nearly 25 percentage points so far this year. We don't know when the perfect time to buy these SaaS stocks is, but we believe this is a good time to establish entry positions in these stocks as these stocks will start to recover their losses after the Fed starts to cut interest rates.\n\nSo, with these details in mind, let's take a look at the best SaaS stocks to buy now according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best SaaS stocks, we first made a list of the top 30 SaaS stocks in the US by their market capitalization. They were then ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024, and the top SaaS stocks were selected. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA software engineer hosting a remote video training session on a multi-cloud database-as-a-service solution.\n\nMongoDB, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MDB) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) is a scalable open-source database platform that allows developers to store, manage, and process structured. semi-structured and unstructured data generated by or feeding into the applications. Atlas, their cloud database-as-a-service platform, supports a comprehensive suite of core workloads, covering database, search, analytics and charts, and device sync. We believe the company is benefiting from a secular increase in demand for high-volume data storage driven by organizations needing to be able to store large amounts of data while still performing rapidly. During the quarter, the company reported strong fiscal fourth quarter results where revenues and operating profits beat analyst estimates, driven by strong growth in Atlas. However, shares fell after management issued forward revenue guidance that was below consensus estimates due to one-time items related to unused credits and multi-year upfront enterprise agreements. Nevertheless, we continue to believe the company is well positioned to become a best-in-class database management platform given its exposure to the secular increase in demand for high volume data storage solutions.\"\n\nA database administrator managing a large database, ensuring the client's data is secure.\n\nMongoDB, Inc.

        "title": "Is It Time to Buy May's Worst-Performing Nasdaq Stocks?",
        "content": "Software stocks had a terrible time in May. The majority of last month's worst-performing shares were software providers. This is notable considering that these rapid-growth stocks rarely go on sale.\n\nBut it's not just high-flying software stocks that had a difficult time. Some biotech companies also struggled in May. If you're looking for growth all-stars at a discount, the two stocks below are for you.\n\nThis growth stock was the worst performer in the Nasdaq last month\n\nFor years, MongoDB(NASDAQ: MDB) has been one of the market's favorite growth tech stocks. But as with any rapid growth stock, the path forward hasn't always been smooth sailing. Last month, for instance, shares lost some 35% of their value. That left MongoDB stock down nearly 20% for the year -- a rare occurrence.\n\nMongoDB is a difficult business for newcomers to understand. But at its core, it is a database company -- hence the \"DB\" in its name. The company specializes in a particular open-source infrastructure called NoSQL, which is more scalable than previous options.\n\nAs Fool.com contributor Daniel Foelber explains: \"MongoDB gained popularity in lockstep with the rise of cloud computing -- which made data storage cheaper. Cheaper storage costs and easier access to the cloud make it more affordable to use a NoSQL program instead of a complex but more precise application.\"\n\nAt the start of May, MongoDB shares were priced at roughly 15 times sales. Right now, they're valued at under 10 times sales. As with most growth stock volatility, the drop was due to fears of a sales growth slowdown. The company beat first-quarter expectations, but management's guidance for the quarters ahead was relatively weak.\n\nExecutives did point out that there were some one-time items -- like the recognition of several multi-year contracts in 2024 -- that aren't expected to reoccur in 2025, creating an artificially high base to compare growth rates. But with the stock trading at a lofty 15 times earnings, there wasn't much room for error.\n\nAnalysts expect growth to pick back up in 2026, but this year could prove difficult for MongoDB as the market digests the lofty valuation in light of weakening results. MDB Chart\n\nCould this biotech company triple in value?\n\nExact Sciences (NASDAQ: EXAS) is another growth stock that stumbled last month. Shares lost\u00a0 about 23% of their value in May. Over the past year, they've lost nearly half of their value. What's going on?\n\nExact Sciences specializes in the early detection of cancer. In 2014, it launched Cologuard, the first stool DNA test for colorectal cancer. The company has other products in the pipeline -- including tests for esophageal, breast, and liver cancers -- but Cologuard is still the biggest financial contributor today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company hopes to launch a new, more reliable form of Cologuard in 2025, but fears over a slowdown in sales growth have dragged the stock lower.\n\nStill, Exact Sciences maintained its full-year sales guidance, telling investors to expect between $2.81 billion and $2.85 billion in revenue this year. And famous investors like Cathie Wood still maintain a position in the stock despite some selling.\n\nIf Exact Sciences can experience success with next year's Cologuard relaunch, plus advance some of its solutions for other indications, May's sell-off could prove an attractive buying opportunity for patient investors. The last time a sell-off occurred this suddenly, shares nearly tripled in value after bottoming at around 3 times sales -- roughly where the stock trades today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MongoDB right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MongoDB, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MongoDB wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Partners with MongoDB to Modernize Core Banking Technology Using Generative AI",
        "content": "Australia's most trusted bank is using MongoDB Atlas and generative AI to significantly reduce costs and accelerate customer-focused innovation\n\nNEW YORK, June 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDB) today announced that Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (ASX: BEN) has partnered with MongoDB to modernize its core banking technology with MongoDB Atlas as the keystone of an ambitious application modernization initiative. During the initiative, the bank: MongoDB\n\nReduced the development time required to migrate a core banking application off of a legacy relational database to MongoDB Atlas by up to 90%. Migrated onto MongoDB Atlas at one-tenth of the cost of a traditional legacy-to-cloud migration. Automated repetitive developer tasks with new AI tooling in order to accelerate developers' pace of innovation. For example, AI-powered automations reduced time spent running application test cases from over 80 hours to just five minutes.\n\nIn less than three months, the bank modernized its Agent Delivery System, a legacy retail banking application, on MongoDB Atlas with the help of MongoDB Relational Migrator and generative AI-assisted modernization tools. The Agent Delivery System is a retail teller application for the bank's agent branches, and is used in communities where digital banking functionality is made available from non-bank businesses, like newsagents or pharmacies. Prior to partnering with MongoDB, the bank ran the system on a legacy relational database that lacked the flexibility to easily evolve to reflect the complex data mapping requirements that today's modern applications demand. Because of these database-related challenges, the bank's analysts and developers were committing significant effort to complex database management tasks in order to keep the application running.\n\nAs a technological leader in the Australian financial services market, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank was eager to enable its developers to focus on more meaningful innovation so the bank could remain agile in a fast-moving market. To do so, the bank decided to modernize its Agent Delivery System to make it easier for its developers to work with data and create innovative, accessible banking services. Specifically, the bank sought to adopt a new microservices architecture to help integrate its data and a robust API ecosystem\u2014a series of connective mechanisms that enable easy data exchange\u2014to facilitate fast, easy data flow between the bank's applications, third parties, and consumers.\n\nThe bank chose MongoDB Atlas as the underlying platform for its tech stack because of the high levels of security and reliability offered by MongoDB Atlas, its ability to manage the bank's real-time, operational data on a unified platform, and because of the intuitive developer experience offered by MongoDB's document model, which maps to how developers think and code, enabling them to build applications faster.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo migrate the Agent Delivery System to MongoDB Atlas, the bank deployed MongoDB Relational Migrator\u2014a tool that helps customers eliminate barriers like time, cost, and risk frequently associated with cloud migrations\u2014to expedite codebase analysis, service decomposition, and application refactoring, ensuring a secure and efficient migration. MongoDB Professional Services worked with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank to create customizable generative AI tooling, including scripts and prompts tailored for the bank's unique tech stack, which accelerated the modernization process by automating integration testing and code generation for seamless deployment of the new Agent Delivery System's microservices architecture. Legacy migrations can otherwise be long, expensive processes, but these solutions enabled Bendigo and Adelaide Bank to complete the migration with 90 percent less human effort and at one-tenth of the cost of a traditional legacy migration.\n\nWith this migration, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank has eliminated volumes of routine code writing and programming work with automated generative AI tooling, which has empowered the bank's developers to innovate with increased agility and more quickly deploy highly-available and performant application features that enhance end-user experiences.\n\n\"This migration was an enormous step forward in our transformation journey and a perfect marriage of people smarts and tech smarts. It's an investment in our customers,\" said Andrew Cresp, Chief Information Officer at Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. \"Now, our lean, highly skilled team can ask MongoDB Atlas and the generative AI tooling MongoDB's Professional Services team built for us to do really smart things, leaving our developers free to focus on other ways they can deliver great outcomes for our customers. We've started by modernizing our most critical applications, and next, we intend to tackle a number of other outdated legacy applications across the bank, putting us on track to meet our target of 50 percent of our critical workloads in the cloud by the end of the year.\"\n\n\"It's important that MongoDB empowers its customers to modernize with applications that are not just future ready, but future-defining. This is paramount for financial institutions, who need to transform quickly and take advantage of advancements like generative AI to best serve their customers,\" said Simon Eid, Senior Vice President, APAC at MongoDB. \"Applying the power of AI to Bendigo and Adelaide Bank's migration process was game-changing. MongoDB looks forward to helping more customers quickly and easily ditch the rigid legacy technology that is slowing them down to achieve all the benefits a modern technology stack can bring to their businesses.\"\n\nAbout MongoDB Atlas MongoDB Atlas is the leading multi-cloud developer data platform that accelerates and simplifies building modern applications with a highly flexible, performant, and globally distributed operational database at its core.

        "content": "Nearly every software company is talking up the potential of artificial intelligence, but not every software company will benefit in a meaningful way. Database software provider MongoDB(NASDAQ: MDB) reported disappointing results and provided lackluster guidance last week, and the company's optimistic talk about AI wasn't enough to prevent the stock from tumbling.\n\nThe most important question to ask\n\nMongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria opened the company's earnings report with a statement about the opportunity presented by AI. MongoDB sees AI spurring companies running legacy workloads to modernize those workloads, thus opening the door for MongoDB's database to replace legacy alternatives. \"We are confident MongoDB will be a substantial beneficiary of this next wave of application development,\" Ittycheria said.\n\nThe big question to ask is this: Is MongoDB any better positioned than its myriad competitors to win market share as AI drives workload modernization? I think the answer is no. Developers are spoiled for choice in the database software market. Managed database products like MongoDB's Atlas are everywhere.\n\nEvery major cloud computing platform offers multiple managed database products. Amazon Web Services, for example, has the MongoDB-compatible DocumentDB service in addition to relational database services. Microsoft Azure offers a similar lineup of database options, as does Alphabet's Google Cloud.\n\nThere's also a slew of privately held technology companies that offer managed database services based on battle-tested open-source database software that run on one of the major cloud platforms. To name a few, there's Aiven, Crunchy Data, PlanetScale, and EDB. Many of these providers are now pushing the AI angle just like MongoDB is doing.\n\nMongoDB doesn't appear to have any real edge in the age of AI.\n\nAtlas weakness\n\nShares of MongoDB crumbled last week following the company's first-quarter report. Revenue grew by 22% year over year, and revenue from Atlas rose 32%. However, Atlas consumption growth and new workload wins during the first quarter were weaker than expected. This weakness will hurt revenue and earnings during the rest of the fiscal year.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, MongoDB now expects to produce revenue between $1.88 billion and $1.90 billion, and adjusted earnings per share between $2.15 and $2.30. Revenue will be up just 12.5% at the midpoint of that range, and EPS will be down 33%. Ouch.\n\nMongoDB's confidence that AI will drive new workload wins is tough to square with its awful outlook for the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you're thinking about buying MongoDB stock on the dip, you should know that the stock's valuation remains in the stratosphere. MongoDB isn't profitable on a GAAP basis, and based on its outlook, the stock trades for over 100 times adjusted earnings. This is a stock that could fall much further before it bottoms out.\n\nAI could drive some business MongoDB's way, but the company and its technology don't stand out as outsize beneficiaries. With growth slowing dramatically and competition intensifying, MongoDB is an AI stock to avoid.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MongoDB right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MongoDB, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MongoDB wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $704,612!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Data Storage Stocks Q1 Teardown: DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) Vs The Rest\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season comes to a close, it\u2019s time to take stock of this quarter's best and worst performers in the data storage industry, including DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) and its peers.\n\nData is the lifeblood of the internet and software in general, and the amount of data created is accelerating. As a result, the importance of storing the data in scalable and efficient formats continues to rise, especially as its diversity and associated use cases expand from analyzing simple, structured datasets to high-scale processing of unstructured data such as images, audio, and video.\n\nThe 4 data storage stocks we track reported a mixed Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.5%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line with consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and while some of the data storage stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 3.5% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nDigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN)\n\nStarted by brothers Ben and Moisey Uretsky, DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) provides a simple, low-cost platform that allows developers and small and medium-sized businesses to host applications and data in the cloud.\n\nDigitalOcean reported revenues of $184.7 million, up 11.9% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 1.2%. It was a decent quarter for the company, with a significant improvement in its gross margin.\n\n\u201cThe first quarter was a strong start to the year as we position the company to be the leading cloud and AI platform for growing technology businesses,\u201d said Paddy Srinivasan, CEO of DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean Total Revenue\n\nDigitalOcean delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates of the whole group. The stock is up 11.5% since the results and currently trades at $36.32.\n\nIs now the time to buy DigitalOcean?

It was a very strong quarter for the company, with management forecasting accelerating growth and a solid beat of analysts' billings estimates.\n\nStory continues Commvault Systems Total Revenue\n\nCommvault Systems delivered the highest full-year guidance raise but had the slowest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is up 11.6% since the results and currently trades at $111.\n\nIs now the time to buy Commvault Systems? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nWeakest Q1: Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW)\n\nFounded in 2013 by three French engineers who spent decades working for Oracle, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) provides a data warehouse-as-a-service in the cloud that allows companies to store large amounts of data and analyze it in real time.\n\nSnowflake reported revenues of $828.7 million, up 32.9% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 5.4%. It was a decent\u00a0quarter for the company, with revenue, net revenue retention, and RPO exceeding expectations.\n\nSnowflake delivered the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth in the group. The company added 24 enterprise customers paying more than $1m annually to reach a total of 485. The stock is down 4.2% since the results and currently trades at $156.41.\n\nRead our full analysis of Snowflake's results here.\n\nMongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB)\n\nStarted in 2007 by the team behind Google\u2019s ad platform, DoubleClick, MongoDB offers database-as-a-service that helps companies store large volumes of semi-structured data.\n\nMongoDB reported revenues of $450.6 million, up 22.3% year on year, surpassing analysts' expectations by 2.4%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with full-year revenue guidance missing analysts' expectations and underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter.\n\nMongoDB had the weakest full-year guidance update among its peers. The company added 85 enterprise customers paying more than $100,000 annually to reach a total of 2,137. The stock is down 24.8% since the results and currently trades at $233.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on MongoDB here, it's free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

The annual core inflation rate also remained unchanged at 2.8%, in line with expectations.\n\nHowever, concerns arose from a deceleration in personal spending and income, raising fears that strong consumer momentum is waning. Additionally, the Chicago PMI dropped to its lowest level since May 2020, increasing worries about an ongoing economic slowdown.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell 1.5%, marking its third straight session of losses and its worst performance in a month. The S&P 500 was down 0.4%, the Russell 2000 edged 0.1% lower, while blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones rose 0.3%, reflecting a shift to high-quality defensive stocks.\n\nTreasury yields fell, boosting fixed-income assets, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rising 0.6%.\n\nGold, tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), unexpectedly fell 0.5%, and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) dropped 1.6%.\n\nFriday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Dow Jones 38,261.57 0.4% Russell 2000 2,052.98 -0.1% S&P 500 5,212.90 -0.4% Nasdaq 100 18,267.38 -1.5%\n\nUpdated at 1:15 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 0.4% lower to $520.54 The\u00a0SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA)\u00a0rose 0.4% to $383.10 The tech-heavy\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust (ARCA: QQQ) fell 1.4% to $445.43 Sector-wise, the\u00a0RealEstate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE)\u00a0outperformed, up by 1.6%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) lagged, down 1.5%.

        "content": "MongoDB's (NASDAQ:MDB) Q1 Sales Top Estimates But Stock Drops 23.4%\n\nDatabase software company MongoDB (MDB) reported Q1 CY2024 results beating Wall Street analysts' expectations , with revenue up 22.3% year on year to $450.6 million. On the other hand, next quarter's revenue guidance of $462 million was less impressive, coming in 2% below analysts' estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.51 per share, down from its profit of $0.58 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy MongoDB? Find out in our full research report.\n\nMongoDB (MDB) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $450.6 million vs analyst estimates of $439.9 million (2.4% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.51 vs analyst estimates of $0.37 (36.5% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2024 is $462 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $471.5 million The company dropped its revenue guidance for the full year from $1.92 billion to $1.89 billion at the midpoint, a 1.3% decrease Gross Margin (GAAP): 72.8%, down from 73.5% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $60.98 million, up 20.8% from the previous quarter Customers: 49,200, up from 47,800 in the previous quarter Billings: $413.1 million at quarter end, up 28.8% year on year Market Capitalization: $24.5 billion\n\n\"MongoDB's delivered solid first quarter results, highlighted by 32% Atlas revenue growth. At the same time, we had a slower than expected start to the year for both Atlas consumption growth and new workload wins, which will have a downstream impact for the remainder of fiscal 2025,\" said Dev Ittycheria, President and Chief Executive Officer of MongoDB.\n\nStarted in 2007 by the team behind Google\u2019s ad platform, DoubleClick, MongoDB offers database-as-a-service that helps companies store large volumes of semi-structured data.\n\nData Storage\n\nData is the lifeblood of the internet and software in general, and the amount of data created is accelerating. As a result, the importance of storing the data in scalable and efficient formats continues to rise, especially as its diversity and associated use cases expand from analyzing simple, structured datasets to high-scale processing of unstructured data such as images, audio, and video.\n\nSales Growth\n\nAs you can see below, MongoDB's revenue growth has been impressive over the last three years, growing from $181.6 million in Q1 2022 to $450.6 million this quarter. MongoDB Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, MongoDB's quarterly revenue was once again up a very solid 22.3% year on year. However, the company's revenue actually decreased by $7.44 million in Q1 compared to the $25.06 million increase in Q4 CY2023. While we'd like to see revenue increase each quarter, management is guiding for growth to rebound in the next quarter and a one-off fluctuation is usually not concerning.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext quarter's guidance suggests that MongoDB is expecting revenue to grow 9% year on year to $462 million, slowing down from the 39.6% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 14.5% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nCustomer Growth\n\nMongoDB reported 49,200 customers at the end of the quarter, an increase of 1,400 from the previous quarter. That's in line with the customer growth we observed last quarter but a bit below what we've typically seen over the last year, suggesting that sales momentum may be slowing a little. MongoDB Customers\n\nKey Takeaways from MongoDB's Q1 Results\n\nIt was good to see MongoDB beat analysts' revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its full-year revenue guidance was dropped and came in below expectations. Its revenue guidance for next quarter also missed Wall Street's estimates. Overall, this was a bad quarter for MongoDB. The company is down 23.4% on the results and currently trades at $237.40 per share.\n\nMongoDB may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

(NASDAQ: MDB) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended April 30, 2024. MongoDB\n\n\"MongoDB's delivered solid first quarter results, highlighted by 32% Atlas revenue growth. At the same time, we had a slower than expected start to the year for both Atlas consumption growth and new workload wins, which will have a downstream impact for the remainder of fiscal 2025,\" said Dev Ittycheria, President and Chief Executive Officer of MongoDB.\n\n\"As we look ahead, we continue to be incredibly excited by our large market opportunity, the potential to increase share, and become a standard within more of our customers. We also see a tremendous opportunity to win more legacy workloads, as AI has now become a catalyst to modernize these applications. MongoDB's document-based architecture is particularly well-suited for the variety and scale of data required by AI-powered applications.\u00a0 We are confident MongoDB will be a substantial beneficiary of this next wave of application development.\"\n\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Highlights\n\nRevenue:  Total revenue was $450.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $436.9 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year, and services revenue was $13.7 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Gross Profit:  Gross profit was $327.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, representing a 73% gross margin compared to 74% in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP gross profit was $337.8 million, representing a 75% non-GAAP gross margin, compared to a non-GAAP gross margin of 76% in the year-ago period. Loss from Operations: Loss from operations was $98.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to a loss from operations of $68.5 million in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP income from operations was $32.8 million, compared to non-GAAP income from operations of $43.7 million in the year-ago period. Net Loss: Net loss was $80.6 million, or $1.10 per share, based on 73.0 million weighted-average shares outstanding, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. This compares to a net loss of $54.2 million, or $0.77 per share, in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP net income was $42.7 million, or $0.51 per share, based on 83.2 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. This compares to a non-GAAP net income of $45.3 million, or $0.56 per share, in the year-ago period. Cash Flow: As of April 30, 2024, MongoDB had $2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. During the three months ended April 30, 2024, MongoDB generated $63.6 million of cash from operations, used $0.5 million of cash in capital expenditures and used $2.1 million of cash in principal repayments of finance leases, leading to free cash flow of $61.0 million, compared to free cash flow of $51.8 million in the year-ago period.\n\nStory continues\n\nA reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has been provided in the financial statement tables included at the end of this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2025 and Recent Business Highlights\n\nMongoDB announced a number of new products and capabilities at MongoDB.local NYC. Highlights included the preview of MongoDB 8.0\u2014with significant performance improvements such as faster reads and updates, along with significantly faster bulk inserts and time series queries\u2014and the general availability of Atlas Stream Processing to build sophisticated, event-driven applications with real-time data. MongoDB continues to expand its AI ecosystem with the announcement of the MongoDB AI Applications Program (MAAP), which provides customers with reference architectures, pre-built partner integrations, and professional services to help them quickly build AI-powered applications. Accenture will establish a center of excellence focused on MongoDB projects, and is the first global systems integrator to join MAAP. Bendigo and Adelaide Bank partnered with MongoDB to modernize their core banking technology. With the help of MongoDB Relational Migrator and generative AI-powered modernization tools, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank decomposed an outdated consumer-servicing application into microservices and migrated off its underlying legacy relational database technology significantly faster and more easily than a traditional migration.\n\nSecond Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2025 Guidance\n\nBased on information available to management as of today, May 30, 2024, MongoDB is issuing the following financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2025.\n\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2025 Full Year Fiscal 2025 Revenue $460.0 million to $464.0 million $1.88 billion to $1.90 billion Non-GAAP Income from Operations $35.0 million to $38.0 million $168.0 million to $183.0 million Non-GAAP Net Income per Share $0.46 to $0.49 $2.15 to $2.30\n\nReconciliations of non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per share guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in MongoDB's stock price. MongoDB expects the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on its future GAAP financial results.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nMongoDB will host a conference call today, May 30, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss its financial results and business outlook. A live webcast of the call will be available on the \"Investor Relations\" page of MongoDB's website at https://investors.mongodb.com.

To avoid delays, we encourage participants to dial into the conference call fifteen minutes ahead of the scheduled start time. A replay of the webcast will also be available for a limited time at http://investors.mongodb.com.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release includes certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements concerning MongoDB's financial guidance for the second fiscal quarter and full year fiscal 2025 and underlying assumptions, our ability to capitalize on our market opportunity and deliver strong growth for the foreseeable future as well as the criticality of MongoDB to artificial intelligence application development. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts and statements identified by words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"will,\" \"would\" or the negative or plural of these words or similar expressions or variations. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to us and on assumptions we have made. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved. Furthermore, actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and are subject to a variety of assumptions, uncertainties, risks and factors that are beyond our control including, without limitation: our customers renewing their subscriptions with us and expanding their usage of software and related services; the effects of the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas on our business and future operating results; economic downturns and/or the effects of rising interest rates, inflation and volatility in the global economy and financial markets on our business and future operating results; our potential failure to meet publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results; our limited operating history; our history of losses; failure of our platform to satisfy customer demands; the effects of increased competition; our investments in new products and our ability to introduce new features, services or enhancements; our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing organization; our ability to continue to build and maintain credibility with the developer community; our ability to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers; our ability to maintain, protect, enforce and enhance our intellectual property; the effects of social, ethical and regulatory issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies, such as artificial intelligence, in our offerings or partnerships; the growth and expansion of the market for database products and our ability to penetrate that market; our ability to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions; our ability to maintain the security of our software and adequately address privacy concerns; our ability to manage our growth effectively and successfully recruit and retain additional highly-qualified personnel; and the price volatility of our common stock. These and other risks and uncertainties are more fully described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. Additional information will be made available in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2024, and other filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC. Except as required by law, we undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this release as a result of new information, future events, changes in expectations or otherwise.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release includes the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and free cash flow. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin exclude expenses associated with stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share exclude:\n\nexpenses associated with stock-based compensation including employer payroll taxes upon the vesting and exercising of stock-based awards and expenses related to stock appreciation rights previously issued to our employees in China; amortization of intangible assets for the acquired technology and acquired customer relationships associated with prior acquisitions; and in the case of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, amortization of the debt issuance costs associated with our convertible senior notes and gains or losses on our financial instruments; additionally, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are adjusted for an assumed provision for income taxes based on an estimated long-term non-GAAP tax rate. The non-GAAP tax rate was calculated utilizing a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments and considers other factors such as operating structure and existing tax positions in various jurisdictions. We intend to periodically reevaluate the projected long-term tax rate, as necessary, for significant events and our ongoing analysis of relevant tax law changes.\n\nMongoDB uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating MongoDB's ongoing operational performance. MongoDB believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial results with other companies in MongoDB's industry, many of which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\n\nFree cash flow represents net cash from/used in operating activities, less capital expenditures, principal repayments of finance lease liabilities and capitalized software development costs, if any. MongoDB uses free cash flow to understand and evaluate its liquidity and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of capital expenditures, principal repayments of finance lease liabilities and amounts capitalized for software development facilitates comparisons of MongoDB's liquidity on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that it does not consider to be indicative of its liquidity. MongoDB believes that free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the strength of its liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in its business in the same manner as MongoDB's management and board of directors.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In particular, other companies may report non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, free cash flow or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as presented below. This earnings press release and any future releases containing such non-GAAP reconciliations can also be found on the Investor Relations page of MongoDB's website at https://investors.mongodb.com.\n\nAbout MongoDB\n\nHeadquartered in New York, MongoDB's mission is to empower innovators to create, transform, and disrupt industries by unleashing the power of software and data.

        "content": "Tech, Blue Chip Stocks Drop; Small Caps, Real Estate Rebound As Yields Ease; Solar Industry Shines: What's Driving Markets Thursday?\n\nWall Street experienced another decline on Thursday, with major large-cap indices affected by a downturn in the tech and communication services sectors.\n\nInvestors shifted their focus to market areas that have underperformed compared to tech over the past year, such as small caps, real estate and solar stocks.\n\nIn economic news, the second estimate of first-quarter GDP growth was revised down to 1.3% from the initial 1.6% estimate, driven by slower consumer spending growth.

        "content": "OpenAI has recently released its GPT-4o AI bot, touted as a more advanced version of its previous language models. This new bot\u00a0is more focused\u00a0on voice inputs and usefulness in day-to-day living than pure logic or reasoning. However, its improvements over previous GPT-4 models have not been groundbreaking, to say the least. That said, it is still worth exploring how this AI bot approaches the stock market. Playing with prompts and asking for different stock picks can\u00a0provide\u00a0some interesting ideas to research.\n\nI did precisely that on some stocks that the GPT-4o bot has picked. I asked\u00a0it\u00a0for more \u201cunder-the-radar\u201d growth stocks, as it regurgitated the usual FAANG/Magnificent 7 tech giants when prompted for growth picks. Here are the three I got.\n\nMongoDB (MDB) An image of a laptop, tablet, and phone with various software and tech imagery on their screens\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI agree with GPT-4o that\u00a0MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) is\u00a0a company\u00a0well-positioned for growth. MongoDB provides a platform that allows developers to build and update applications with greater ease and efficiency.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the company\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter, MongoDB again showed solid execution. Revenue increased 27% to $458 million. Additionally, both revenue and earnings exceeded expectations.\u00a0Atlas,\u00a0their cloud database offering,\u00a0remains the key driver of growth, growing 34% and now accounting for 68% of the company\u2019s total revenue.\u00a0The company added over 7,000 new customers\u00a0last year across both\u00a0small startups and large Fortune 500 companies.\u00a0MongoDB\u2019s earnings per share metric is very bullish, considering the 86 cents figure beat analyst estimates by 39 cents.\n\nPaying 148-times forward earnings here is\u00a0definitely\u00a0quite the premium. However, the company should\u00a0be able to sustain annual revenue growth well above 25% for years to come, along with juicy earnings growth averaging roughly 40%. MDB revenue estimates. growth stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nEven if this stock\u2019s premium remains 50% intact, MDB stock should deliver significant gains over the next decade.\n\nDexCom (DXCM) A woman wearing a continuous glucose monitor device holds a phone displaying a glucose monitor app.\n\nSource: Andrew_Popov / Shutterstock.com\n\nDexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) is in the continuous glucose monitoring business. The company\u2019s G7 system, which came out last year, has already made a big impact with\u00a0how accurate and easy to use it is, plus how well it connects\u00a0to popular devices.\n\nIn Q1, DexCom saw their\u00a0sales grow an impressive 25% to $921 million, beating estimates. Earnings per share also beat by 18.6%. It\u2019s a major positive that more doctors are recommending the G7, and insurance is covering this device for more patients.\n\nStory continues DXCM revenue. Growth stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWhat gives me hope is how fast DexCom innovates on new products. Since releasing the G7, the company has sent\u00a0out\u00a0monthly updates to improve how it functions, connects to other things, and is used.\u00a0Getting\u00a0approved to connect directly to the Apple Watch makes this device the first CGM that can do that.\n\nWith more people (sadly) getting diabetes worldwide, DexCom\u2019s top-notch glucose monitoring system sets up\u00a0DexCom well\u00a0for\u00a0strong\u00a0growth.\u00a0If the company can keep\u00a0making progress\u00a0like this,\u00a0I\u00a0definitely\u00a0think\u00a0DXCM stock can outperform.\u00a0The stock is still down some 19% from its 2021 high.\n\nNutrien (NTR) A photo of Nutrien's (NTR) website, with a magnifying glass over the logo.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh/ShutterStock.com\n\nNutrien (NYSE:NTR) is another solid pick by GPT-4o. A fertilizer company, Nutrien is also a different type of bet than the other two. That\u2019s because Nutrien\u2019s growth is relatively muted, so a recovery is what I\u2019m hoping for.\u00a0And\u00a0I think\u00a0that\u00a0recovery\u00a0is underway, since NTR stock has appreciated 24% since mid-February.\n\nNutrien\u00a0reported adjusted EBITDA of\u00a0CAD$1.1 billion, aided by improved margins on crop nutrients, higher fertilizer production meeting strong demand, increased sales volume, and lower operational expenses. The company\u2019s agricultural retail division also saw significant year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA.\n\nAccording to Nutrien\u2019s estimates, global supply and demand for potash appear\u00a0fairly\u00a0balanced. The company\u00a0is maintaining\u00a0its full-year forecast for worldwide potash shipments at 68-71 million metric tonnes.\u00a0I believe\u00a0Nutrien is well-positioned to benefit from these favorable market dynamics and continue recovering.\u00a0Indeed, NTR stock\u00a0seems to have\u00a0bottomed out at current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Loss-Making MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) Expected To Breakeven In The Medium-Term",
        "content": "With the business potentially at an important milestone, we thought we'd take a closer look at MongoDB, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MDB) future prospects. MongoDB, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides general purpose database platform worldwide. On 31 January 2024, the US$27b market-cap company posted a loss of US$177m for its most recent financial year. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which MongoDB will turn a profit, with the big question being \u201cwhen will the company breakeven?\u201d Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts\u2019 expectations for the company.\n\nView our latest analysis for MongoDB\n\nMongoDB is bordering on breakeven, according to the 30 American IT analysts. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2026, before turning a profit of US$24m in 2027. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 3 years from today. How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2027? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 25% year-on-year, on average, which is extremely buoyant. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict. earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for MongoDB given that this is a high-level summary, though, take into account that typically a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.\n\nBefore we wrap up, there\u2019s one issue worth mentioning. MongoDB currently has a debt-to-equity ratio of 107%. Generally, the rule of thumb is debt shouldn\u2019t exceed 40% of your equity, which in this case, the company has significantly overshot. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nThis article is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis on MongoDB, so if you are interested in understanding the company at a deeper level, take a look at MongoDB's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of key aspects you should look at:\n\nValuation: What is MongoDB worth today?

        "content": "Four new independently vetted certifications empower organizations with unique regulatory requirements to confidently adopt and run MongoDB Atlas\n\nNEW YORK, May 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDB) today announced MongoDB Atlas's compliance with four additional security certifications\u2014ISO 9001, TISAX, HDS, and TX-RAMP\u2014which further MongoDB's commitment to safeguarding enterprise and public sector customer data. These latest certifications build upon MongoDB's strong portfolio of compliance resources and affirm MongoDB Atlas's ability to help our customers meet their most unique compliance, regulatory, and policy objectives. It's now even easier for customers in highly regulated industries to adopt and run MongoDB Atlas for mission-critical workloads while maintaining compliance with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. MongoDB\n\n\"Data is the new gold, and organizations everywhere want to take full advantage of it to build, scale, and run modern applications that transform industries and deliver exceptional customer experiences,\" said George Gerchow, MongoDB's Head of Trust. \"But customers, especially those with sensitive or highly regulated workloads, need assurance that their technology partners are keeping their data secure, while facilitating compliance with an increasingly complex set of regulatory requirements. Thousands of MongoDB's customers already trust us to manage their most critical workloads, and these latest certifications give them even more reason to do so.\"\n\nFulfilling stringent international standards for quality management: Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ISO 9001:2015 is an international standard for quality management systems that is widely recognized across industries and organizations of all sizes. MongoDB Atlas's ISO 9001:2015 certification demonstrates to customers that we have implemented a robust quality management system that aligns to stringent security and regulatory standards. ISO 9001:2015 emphasizes MongoDB's focus on delivering long-term consistency in product and service quality, which is just one reason why thousands of highly regulated customers like Wells Fargo, the UK's Department for Work and Pensions, and GE Healthcare, use MongoDB Atlas to build modern applications that deliver safe, reliable, and performant end-user experiences.  Meeting security requirements for the\u00a0EU\u00a0automotive industry: MongoDB Atlas is now certified by the Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX), a program that evaluates vendors in the automotive technology supply chain. MongoDB Atlas demonstrated compliance with the highest TISAX assessment level available, affirming our ability to protect highly sensitive data for European automotive customers while delivering strong business continuity, disaster recovery, and risk mitigation. MongoDB is a trusted partner for automotive industry leaders, and already, Volvo Connect, Cox Automotive, Toyota Connected, and 11 of the top 15 auto manufacturers in the world run on MongoDB.  Protecting personal health data in France: Issued by the French Public Health Code, Health Data Hosting\u2014or H\u00e9bergeur de Donn\u00e9es de Sant\u00e9 (HDS)\u2014certifies that French healthcare providers can safely store personal health data in MongoDB Atlas and across HDS-compliant Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure cloud regions. Eight of the top 10 healthcare companies in the world are MongoDB customers, and now, even more healthcare industry leaders can use MongoDB's developer data platform to modernize their applications to improve patient experiences, all while keeping their data secure and their organizations compliant with HDS.  Meeting the requirements of the State of Texas for cloud providers: Established by the Texas Department of Information Services, the Texas Risk and Authorization Management Program (TX-RAMP) is a program that certifies the security of cloud computing services used by Texas state agencies.

        "content": "European stocks started the day on May 21 with a slightly weaker note, marking a retreat from their recent impressive performance, with attention now shifting towards the upcoming earnings report from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The Stoxx 600 index dipped by 0.2%, showing a predominantly negative trend across most sectors, while futures for US equities remained relatively unchanged. Options markets in the US indicate significant anticipation for NVDA earnings report this Wednesday, with traders expecting a notable shift in the chipmaker's shares, reported Reuters.\n\nWhile expectations are high, there's recognition that the upcoming earnings announcement could trigger significant market activity. Implied volatility for options suggests traders are prepared for both upward and downward movements in the stock price. Despite Nvidia's impressive performance this year, investors remain vigilant, aware that a substantial downturn in NVIDIA shares could test the resilience of the broader AI trade, emphasizing the significance of NVDA's role in shaping market sentiment and trends.\n\nA software engineer hosting a remote video training session on a multi-cloud database-as-a-service solution.\n\nMeanwhile, in Asia, shares took a breather following a week-long streak of gains. Investors remained vigilant regarding commodity prices, especially with the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index hitting its highest point since January 2023. Notably, gold and copper were trading near their historical peaks, adding to the market's attention.\n\nOn another front, oil prices experienced a decline, influenced by various market metrics suggesting a subdued outlook, despite heightened geopolitical tensions ahead of an OPEC+ meeting on supply. Brent crude's prompt spread narrowed to its smallest backwardation since January, indicating a potential shift in market dynamics, while the reduction in bets on crude price increases continued among money managers. Futures trading reflected a period of consolidation, with implied volatility levels nearing lows not seen since 2019.\n\nFrom Chinese property market side, analysts suggest that China's recent efforts to bolster the property sector will require patience to yield results. Despite these initiatives, S&P maintains its view that the market is still \"searching for a bottom.\" Edward Chan from S&P emphasizes the government's seriousness in stabilizing the property sector but notes that significant stabilization requires improvements in homebuyers' demand and confidence, which have been affected by a nearly three-year market downturn. According to CNBC, recent measures, including lowered down payment minimums and enhanced liquidity for developers, aim to address the challenges. However, analysts like Goldman Sachs' Hui Shan and Nomura's Ting Lu believe more substantial actions are needed, estimating a significant funding requirement to address inventory excess and stabilize prices. While progress is noted, challenges persist, as indicated by declining real estate investment and slower-than-expected retail sales growth. Rebuilding homebuyer confidence is crucial, particularly concerning delivery delays and economic uncertainty. Analysts anticipate further efforts from Beijing, including a national survey to assess funding needs for completing residential projects. Ultimately, restoring confidence in the presale system is seen as essential for a genuine recovery in China's housing markets. As market players navigate these developments, attention remains keenly focused on unfolding events and their potential impact on investment strategies and market sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bearish on stocks such as MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) by lowering their price targets. For a comprehensive overview of MongoDB, Inc.

Unlike add-on solutions that only store vector data, MongoDB Atlas Vector Search powers generative AI applications by functioning as a highly performant and scalable vector database with the added benefit of being integrated with a globally distributed operational database that can store and process all of an organization's data.\n\nStory continues\n\nCustomers can use the integration between MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and Amazon Bedrock to privately customize FMs like large language models (LLMs)\u2014from AI21 Labs, Amazon, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, and Stability AI\u2014with their real-time operational data by converting it into vector embeddings for use with LLMs. Using Agents for Amazon Bedrock for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), customers can then build applications with LLMs that respond to user queries with relevant, contextualized responses\u2014without needing to manually code. For example, a retail organization can more easily develop a generative AI application that uses autonomous agents for tasks like processing real-time inventory requests or to help personalize customer returns and exchanges by automatically suggesting in-stock merchandise based on customer feedback. Organizations can also isolate and scale their generative AI workloads independent of their core operational database with MongoDB Atlas Search Nodes to optimize cost and performance with up to 60 percent faster query times.\n\nWith fully managed capabilities, this new integration enables joint AWS and MongoDB customers to securely use generative AI with their proprietary data to its full extent throughout an organization, and to realize business value more quickly\u2014with less operational overhead and manual work.

        "content": "General availability of MongoDB Atlas Stream Processing makes it easier for developers to use real-time streaming data to build event-driven application experiences in a unified environment\n\nMongoDB Atlas Search Nodes newly available on Microsoft Azure allow organizations to isolate and scale generative AI workloads with up to 60% faster query times and lower cost\n\nMongoDB Atlas Edge Server enables customers to seamlessly run distributed applications closer to end-users from the cloud to the edge and in between\n\nAcoustic, Bosch Digital, Eni, Forbes, and Meltwater among the tens of thousands of customers building modern applications with MongoDB Atlas\n\nNEW YORK, May 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDB) today at its developer conference MongoDB.local NYC announced new capabilities for MongoDB Atlas that make it faster and easier to build, deploy, and run modern applications with the performance and scale organizations require. MongoDB Atlas is the most widely distributed developer data platform in the world, and tens of thousands of customers and millions of developers rely on its industry-leading operational database and integrated data services to power business-critical applications across cloud providers. The general availability of MongoDB Atlas Stream Processing makes it easier to use real-time data from a wide variety of sources to run highly responsive applications. MongoDB Atlas Search Nodes on Microsoft Azure give organizations more flexibility for optimizing the performance and cost of generative AI workloads that drive intelligent applications at scale. MongoDB Atlas Edge Server reduces the complexity of managing data for distributed applications that span locations from the cloud to on premises to devices at the edge. MongoDB\n\n\"Customers tell us they love MongoDB Atlas because it provides an integrated set of capabilities on one platform that can store and process their organization's operational data across all of their applications,\" said Sahir Azam, Chief Product Officer at MongoDB. \"Customers also tell us that MongoDB's highly flexible and scalable document data model is a perfect fit for powering modern applications that can take advantage of generative AI and their real-time proprietary data. The additional services we're launching today for MongoDB Atlas not only make it easier to build, deploy, and run modern applications, but also make it easier to optimize performance while reducing costs.\"\n\nThe new MongoDB Atlas capabilities announced today enable organizations of all sizes across industries to build, deploy, and run next-generation applications with the security, resiliency, and durability today's business environment demands:\n\nStory continues\n\nSimplify building highly responsive applications with streaming data: Now generally available, MongoDB Atlas Stream Processing enables developers to take advantage of data in motion and data at rest to power event-driven applications that can respond to changing conditions. Streaming data\u2014coming from sources like IoT devices, customer browsing behaviors, and inventory feeds\u2014is critical to modern applications because it allows organizations to create dynamic experiences as end-user behaviors or conditions change. However, streaming data is highly dynamic, and inflexible data models are not ideal for building event-driven applications that need to continuously adjust to the real world. Because it is built on a flexible and scalable data model, MongoDB Atlas Stream Processing allows organizations to build applications that analyze data in motion and at rest and make adjustments to business logic in seconds. For example, organizations can build applications that dynamically optimize shipping routes based on weather conditions and supply chain data feeds, or can continuously analyze financial transaction data feeds and purchase histories for AI-powered fraud detection in near-real time. By using MongoDB Atlas Stream Processing, organizations can do more with their data in less time and with less operational overhead.  Optimize the performance and efficiency of generative AI applications: MongoDB Atlas Search Nodes\u2014generally available on AWS and Google Cloud, and now in preview on Microsoft Azure\u2014provide dedicated infrastructure for generative AI and relevance-based search workloads that use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and MongoDB Atlas Search. MongoDB Atlas Search Nodes are independent of core operational database nodes and allow customers to isolate workloads, optimize costs, and reduce query times by up to 60 percent. In addition to helping optimize performance and cost, MongoDB Atlas Search Nodes enable organizations to run highly available generative AI and relevance-based search workloads at scale for the most demanding applications. For example, an airline company can use MongoDB Atlas Search Nodes to optimize the performance and scale an AI-powered booking agent experiencing a surge in usage by seamlessly isolating the vector search workload and scaling the required infrastructure\u2014without resizing the required compute or memory resources for their operational database workload.  Deploy applications that seamlessly connect from the cloud to the edge: Now available in public preview, MongoDB Atlas Edge Server gives developers the capability to deploy and operate distributed applications in the cloud and at the edge. MongoDB Atlas Edge Server provides a local instance of MongoDB with a synchronization server that runs on local or remote infrastructure and significantly reduces the complexity and risk involved in managing applications in edge environments. With MongoDB Atlas Edge Server, applications can access operational data even with intermittent connections to the cloud. For example, a hospital system can use MongoDB Atlas Edge Server to help enable applications running on patient healthcare devices to remain functional during power outages and connectivity disruptions. With Atlas Edge Server, their data will automatically synchronize once connectivity is restored. MongoDB Atlas Edge Server also supports data tiering to prioritize the synchronization of critical data to the cloud, reducing network congestion. And, MongoDB Atlas Edge Server maintains a local data layer to reduce latency and enable faster actions based on real-time data. With MongoDB Atlas Edge Server, organizations can seamlessly run highly available, modern applications closer to end-users with less complexity.\n\nMongoDB customers welcome new capabilities to help them build modern applications with less complexity\n\nAcoustic is a customer-obsessed marketing technology company committed to creating powerful tools that are easy to use. \"At Acoustic, our key focus is to empower brands with behavioral insights that enable them to create engaging, personalized customer experiences,\" said John Riewerts, EVP of Engineering at Acoustic. \"With Atlas Stream Processing, our engineers can leverage the skills they already have from working with data in Atlas to process new data continuously, ensuring our customers have access to real-time customer insights.\"\n\nBosch Digital supports and consults the entire Bosch Group with all its business units in implementing digital business and scalable solutions. \"We don't do anything theoretical at Bosch Digital, and with MongoDB we can keep building on past experience,\" said Steffen G\u00fcrtler, Senior Expert of IoT Data Management at Bosch Digital. \"We don't have to start from scratch, which means we can innovate much faster with less effort.\"\n\nBased in Italy, Eni is a leading integrated energy company with more than 30,000 employees across 69 countries. \"MongoDB Atlas is simple to integrate and makes it easy to ingest and deduplicate data from other systems,\" said Sabato Severino, Senior AI Solution Architect for Geoscience at Eni. \"The advanced security features such as authentication, authorization, and encryption of data in transit and at rest are vital to protect data and reduce the risk of loss.

With the MongoDB AI Applications Program, we and our partners help customers use generative AI to enhance productivity, revolutionize customer interactions, and drive industry advancements.\"\n\nGenerative AI-driven innovation has set a clear imperative for every organization\u2014to compete, they need to modernize their applications to meet and exceed customer expectations. Organizations of every size across industries want to immediately take advantage of this technological shift, but are unsure if they have the right data strategy and technology in place that will lead to success in building, deploying, and scaling new classes of applications securely and reliably. Many organizations are stuck with ineffective ways of working with data because of legacy technology that cannot scale, while others attempt to use single-purpose, bolt-on solutions that introduce unnecessary complexity and cost. As a result, these organizations wind up trading off long-term success\u2014because of outdated technology or add-on solutions\u2014for short-term results with proofs of concept that cannot scale to production, offer enterprise-grade security and reliability, or provide a meaningful return on their investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nMAAP addresses these challenges by providing customers with the strategic framework, expert professional services, and technology roadmap to identify and work backward from business problems, rapidly build and iterate on solutions, and to optimize innovative generative AI applications\u2014empowering customers to put them into production. Combined with MongoDB's technology that enables companies to deploy generative AI applications with a unified developer data platform, MAAP delivers an end-to-end solution through its partnerships with industry-leading consultancies and FM, cloud infrastructure, and generative AI framework and model hosting providers\u2014including Anthropic, Anyscale, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cohere, Credal.ai, Fireworks.ai, Google Cloud, gravity9, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Microsoft Azure, Nomic, PeerIslands, Pureinsights, and Together AI. MAAP offers customers the technology, full-service engagement, and expert support required to:\n\nDevelop end-to-end strategies and\u00a0roadmaps to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications with hands-on support: Engagement with MAAP begins with highly personalized deep dives. MongoDB Professional Services evaluates an organization's current technology stack and works with customers to identify business problems to work backward from. MongoDB Professional Services and consultancy partners then develop strategic roadmaps to rapidly prototype the required architecture, validate that initial results meet customer expectations, and then optimize fully built applications that customers can evolve for use in production. Customers can continue receiving support from MongoDB Professional Services to develop new generative AI features depending on their needs.  Build high-performing generative AI applications that are secure, reliable, and trustworthy: Enterprises must trust that new technology being deployed throughout their organization and in customer-facing applications will behave as expected and will not inadvertently expose sensitive data. MAAP offers a curated selection of leading FMs that have been designed for safety, trustworthiness, and usefulness by MAAP partners. By combining these FMs with techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using proprietary data with robust governance controls, customers can reduce model hallucinations by controlling exactly what data is provided to FMs to give them the required context that improves accuracy. Customers can also use optimized fine-tuning and inference services through MAAP partners for domain-specific use cases and fast AI model response times using models from Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral, OpenAI, and more. With MAAP, customers get the generative AI reference architectures, integrated technology, and prescriptive guidance needed for their use cases through hands-on professional services to help them build secure, high-performing applications that function as intended.  Engage in generative AI jump-start sessions with industry experts: Organizations not yet ready to adopt generative AI at scale can customize their MAAP engagement to provide their teams prototyping sessions in a secure, private, sandbox environment. For example, a customized engagement with MAAP can include an organization's strategy, operations, IT, or software development teams\u2014or a combination of several teams\u2014where an expert-led session brings together different perspectives and aims to identify an internal business challenge that generative AI can be applied to. MongoDB Professional Services can then lead a hackathon to collaboratively build a solution and test its effectiveness for internal use cases. MAAP provides the education, resources, and technology needed to quickly build a tangible solution to see generative AI in action solving a specific business problem.\n\nMongoDB customers welcome MAAP to help them build applications enriched with generative AI\n\nACI Worldwide powers mission-critical real-time payment software solutions for thousands of organizations around the world.

        "title": "MongoDB, Inc. (MDB) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "MongoDB (MDB) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this database platform have returned +3.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which MongoDB belongs, has lost 4.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, MongoDB is expected to post earnings of $0.38 per share, indicating a change of -32.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -27.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.28 indicates a change of +36.2% from what MongoDB is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, MongoDB is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of MongoDB, the consensus sales estimate of $438.44 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +19.1%. The $1.92 billion and $2.36 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.2% and +22.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMongoDB reported revenues of $458 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.8%. EPS of $0.86 for the same period compares with $0.57 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $431.99 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.02%. The EPS surprise was +86.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMongoDB is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about MongoDB. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Data Storage Stocks Q4 Results: Benchmarking Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW)\n\nAs the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here's a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q4. Today, we are looking at data storage stocks, starting with Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW).\n\nData is the lifeblood of the internet and software in general, and the amount of data created is accelerating. As a result, the importance of storing the data in scalable and efficient formats continues to rise, especially as its diversity and associated use cases expand from analyzing simple, structured datasets to high-scale processing of unstructured data such as images, audio, and video.\n\nThe 5 data storage stocks we track reported a decent Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 4.1%, while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.5% above consensus. Stocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, had a good end of 2023. The beginning of 2024 saw mixed inflation data, however, leading to more volatile stock performance, and data storage stocks have had a rough stretch, with share prices down 9.7% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW)\n\nFounded in 2013 by three French engineers who spent decades working for Oracle, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) provides a data warehouse-as-a-service in the cloud that allows companies to store large amounts of data and analyze it in real time.\n\nSnowflake reported revenues of $774.7 million, up 31.5% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 2%. It was a mixed quarter\u00a0for the company, with strong free cash flow, while still growing revenue at 30%+, which is certainly an impressive feat. On the other hand, its net revenue retention declined again and product guidance for Q1 missed analysts' estimates.\n\n\u201cSnowflake finished fiscal 2024 with a 38% year-over-year product revenue growth, totaling $2.67 billion. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $810 million, representing 56% year-over-year growth,\u201d said Frank Slootman, Chairman of the Board, Snowflake. Snowflake Total Revenue\n\nSnowflake scored the fastest revenue growth of the whole group. The company added 25 enterprise customers paying more than $1m annually to reach a total of 461. The stock is down 33.1% since the results and currently trades at $153.8.\n\nWe think Snowflake is a good business, but is it a buy today?

It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' billings estimates.

It was a weaker quarter for the company, with revenue exceedidng expectations. On the other hand, its full-year revenue guidance was below expectations and suggests a slowdown in demand.\n\nMongoDB had the weakest full-year guidance update in the group. The company added 80 enterprise customers paying more than $100,000 annually to reach a total of 2,052.

        "title": "MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) shareholders have earned a 23% CAGR over the last five years",
        "content": "While MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 10% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. We think most investors would be happy with the 181% return, over that period. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nView our latest analysis for MongoDB\n\nMongoDB isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally hope to see good revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.\n\nIn the last 5 years MongoDB saw its revenue grow at 34% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Meanwhile, its share price performance certainly reflects the strong growth, given the share price grew at 23% per year, compound, during the period. This suggests the market has well and truly recognized the progress the business has made. To our minds that makes MongoDB worth investigating - it may have its best days ahead.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nMongoDB is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for MongoDB in this interactivegraph of future profit estimates.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that MongoDB shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 58% over one year. That's better than the annualised return of 23% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted  2 warning signs for MongoDB you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Corporate Insiders are Dumping These 11 Tech Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Corporate Insiders are Dumping These 5 Tech Stocks.\n\nThe US stock market is on track to conclude a solid week on Friday, as the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest statement saying it\u2019s still targeting three rate cuts this year soothed investors\u2019 nerves. However, many analysts have been repeatedly saying that the overall performance of the stock market would be lukewarm this year as they think the AI-fueled rally has already gone too far and the market needs a breather. UBS recently said in a note that investors should not be \u201csurprised\u201d by a pullback in the short term because of high valuations. However, UBS sees any decline in stocks as a buying opportunity.\n\nLast month, when most of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks slipped, market experts pointed to huge crowding around mega-cap tech stocks and high expectations of investors as the reasons behind the pullback. \u00a0A report by the Wall Street Journal quoted George Maris, global equities chief investment officer at Principal Asset Management, who said that because there are \u201cso many people that have crowded\u201d into mega-cap tech stocks, expectations of the market have gone through the roof. The analyst said investors hit the exit button on \u201canything\u201d that they perceive is not \u201cbulletproof.\u201d\n\nBlackRock also said in one of its March updates that while it\u2019s highly bullish on US stocks, stretched valuations means investors would have to be \u201cchoosy\u201d while picking stocks. BlackRock also said that it\u2019s time to look beyond the \u201cfirst layer\u201d of AI tech stack \u2014 the obvious names like chips, data centers and infrastructure \u2014 and focus on companies that would benefit from the AI revolution in various other sectors. These include companies that mine, process and store data, according to BlackRock. Corporate Insiders are Dumping These Tech Stocks\n\nPhoto by AlphaTradeZone\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this backdrop, it\u2019s important to see which tech stocks are being dumped by corporate insiders. For this article we first used Insider Monkey\u2019s stock screener to identify all tech stocks that saw insider selling activity over the past few weeks and picked 11 companies with the highest insider selling activity from insiders (executives, officers, directors) in terms of dollar value. Some top names in the list include Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund and insider activity? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11.

However, Palantir Technologies Inc's (NYSE:PLTR) cofounder Peter Thiel on March 12 sold about seven million shares of Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR)\u00a0at $24.79 per share. The stock is down by just 0.8% since then.\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPalantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR)\u2019s stock moved higher on hopes that it could win business from the U.K.\u2019s National Health Services and as customer counts grew rapidly in the latest quarterly report for the company\u2019s new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Palantir also won a significant new contract with the U.S. Army in September, which should last through 2026. The debate on the street is how fast Palantir can monetize its new commercial customers. After the quarter closed, the company announced an enhanced marketing deal with a major auditing and consulting firm.\u201d\n\n9.

The company continues to gain market share while holding significant competitive advantages thanks to its robust delivery network.\u201d\n\n7. Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 56\n\nDell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\u00a0saw heavy insider selling activity this month. Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\u00a0CEO Michael Dell dumped 2,977,478 shares of Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\u00a0on March 19 at $108.52 per share. The stock has jumped about 6% since then.\n\nLast month Dell stock soared after Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) posted strong Q4 results that were aided by upbeat demand for Dell Technologies Inc's (NYSE:DELL) AI servers. During its Q4 earning call Dell's management talked about AI-related opportunities and their impact on business:\n\n\"We have just started to touch the AI opportunities ahead of us, including broader adoption of AI by enterprise customers and the projected growth in unstructured data where we are well-positioned with industry-leading storage solutions. We believe the long-term AI action is on-prem where customers can keep their data and intellectual property safe and secure. PCs will become even more essential as most day-to-day work with AI will be done on the PC. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in our CSG business. Look for us to make a number of new product and solution announcements at Dell Technology World in May that will help customers get started with AI and make it easy. Turning to Q4, we saw positive signs in the business as we exited the year, but enterprise and large customers remained cautious with their spend.\n\nOur Q4 execution was solid given the environment with ISG faring better than CSG. We delivered revenue of $22.3 billion with strong profitability and cash flow. Operating income was $2.1 billion. Diluted EPS was $2.20, and cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion. In ISG, traditional server demand grew year-over-year and a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth, and storage demand grew above normal seasonality, though down year-over-year as expected. Storage recovery typically lags servers by a couple of quarters. Our strong momentum in the AI build-out continues as we believe Dell is uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers build Gen-AI solutions that meet their performance, cost, and security requirements. In Q4, we saw strength across a wider range of customers and geographies within expanding pipeline.\n\nAI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6.

        "title": "2 Stocks That Will Surge on the Next Wave of AI",
        "content": "It's been a little more than 15 months since ChatGPT launched, and it's clear who the early winners of the AI revolution are.\n\nAI hardware stocks like Nvidia have been far and away the leaders in the new tech boom. Nvidia's GPUs are the core component required for running intense models like ChatGPT, and demand for them has been enormous, driving Nvidia's revenue up by more than 200% and its profits by an even greater multiple. Companies that partner with Nvidia to sell hardware have also emerged as winners. Those include Super Micro Computer, which specializes in selling high-density servers and storage equipment that work well for running AI applications; Arm Holdings, which licenses its power-conserving chip designs to Nvidia to use for running AI models; and Oracle, which has seen strong growth in its cloud infrastructure business as demand for Nvidia-based superclusters jumps.\n\nEven other chip stocks, like AMD and Intel, have soared in anticipation of spiking demand even as those companies have yet to see significant revenue growth from the AI boom.\n\nHowever, the cloud infrastructure giants, AI start-ups, and others aren't stocking up GPUs to hoard them. They're aiming to run new applications and software programs, and it's a good bet that software companies will be the next winners in the AI revolution. Keep reading to see two that could capitalize on the new tech boom. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. MongoDB\n\nMongoDB (NASDAQ: MDB) has risen to prominence as a leader in NoSQL databases. It helps organizations organize data that doesn't conform to a strict spreadsheet grid.\n\nAs a database tool, there's a natural overlap between MongoDB's utility and the potential of generative AI, which makes it easier to find information, apply it, run models, or transform it as needed.\n\nMongoDB has begun incorporating some generative AI features into its software. For example, in December, the company launched Vector Search, which uses generative AI to help its customers build applications with MongoDB data. However, the biggest tailwinds from AI are still yet to come for MongoDB.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the recent earnings call, CEO Dev Ittycheria walked investors through the implications of AI for the business, saying, \"It's important to understand that there are three layers to the AI stack. The first layer is the underlying compute and LLMs, the second layer is the fine-tuning of the models and building of AI applications, and the third layer is deploying and running applications that end users interact with.\"\n\nMongoDB operates in the second and third layers of that stack, and Ittycheria said that MongoDB's customers are still experimenting with their AI applications. As experimentation moves to action, the company looks well positioned to benefit from an uptick in demand once businesses are confident that they can unlock the power of AI. That could take several quarters, but the company is likely to be a long-term winner from AI. In the meantime, MongoDB is still growing rapidly, with revenue up 27% in its most recent quarter.\n\n2. Duolingo\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL), the leading language-learning app, overcame some early concerns that AI could disrupt its business model rather than complement it.\n\nLast spring, the stock briefly fell when education platform Chegg said it was losing customers to ChatGPT, but investors have since realized that Duolingo looks to be a winner from AI, and its shares have surged over the last few months as it's delivered impressive growth.\n\nDuolingo has moved quickly to incorporate AI tools into its app. A year ago, it unveiled a new conversation mode built on OpenAI's GPT4, which served as the foundation of its new highest-tier product, Duolingo Max. The company has also begun using AI to create sentences for its lessons and has laid off some contractors as it relies more on AI and less on humans.\n\nLooking ahead, it's easy to imagine how Duolingo can more fully capitalize on the potential of generative AI. It could develop an AI conversation partner so users can practice a new language in a real conversation. It could offer AI-based customizable lessons so users can focus on context or a certain set of vocabulary depending on their needs, and it can use AI to accelerate its expansion beyond languages into areas like early literacy, math, and music.\n\nDoing so will not only help Duolingo reach more users at a lower cost, but it could also help it gain greater adoption in K-12 and university education, tapping into a potentially highly lucrative revenue stream.\n\nDuolingo's leadership is well versed in AI and technology, as CEO Luis von Ahn had previously sold a reverse image search technology to Alphabet's Google, and also helped develop CAPTCHA and ReCAPTCHA, tools that prevent robots from logging into a website.\n\nDuolingo stock is pricey, but the company is growing quickly, its profitability is improving, and generative AI significantly expands its addressable market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MongoDB right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MongoDB, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MongoDB wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript March 7, 2024\n\nMongoDB, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to MongoDB's [Technical Difficulty] At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation [Technical Difficulty] question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] [Technical Difficulty] I will now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Brian Denyeau. [Technical Difficulty] Go ahead.\n\nBrian Denyeau: Thanks, Valerie. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB's fourth quarter fiscal 2024 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB, and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial conditions, that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\n\nFor discussion of material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on December 7, 2023.

Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the investor relations portion of our website for reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\n\nStory continues\n\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter that capped off an impressive year as we continue to execute well to capture a large market opportunity. I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results before giving you a broader company update. Starting with the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $458 million, a 27% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 34% year-over-year, representing 68% of revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $69.2 million for a 15% non-GAAP operating margin, and we ended the quarter with over 47,800 customers. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter.\n\nWe had a healthy quarter of new business led by continued strength in new workload acquisition within our existing Atlas customers. In addition, our Enterprise Advanced business again exceeded our expectations, demonstrating strong demand for our platform and the appeal of our run anywhere strategy. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends, the quarter played out in line with our expectations and we saw a stronger consumption than in Q4 last year. Michael will discuss consumption trends in more detail. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q4, reinforcing the quality of our product and the mission criticality of our platform. Stepping back and looking at fiscal \u201824 as a whole, I'm proud of what we accomplished. We achieved revenue growth of 31% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 16%, well above our initial expectations.\n\nAtlas grew 37% year-over-year, and we added over 7,000 customers, ranging from AI startups to Fortune 500 companies. We had a record year of fast-paced innovative product releases such as Vector Search, Queryable Encryption, and the preview of Atlas Stream Processing, reinforcing why so many customers and developers choose MongoDB's developer data platform. Finally, we continue to innovate on our go-to-market motion to drive workload acquisition. As we look into fiscal \u201825, let me share with you what I see in the market. First, I'm excited about our opportunity to win new business. In today's digital world, customers express their business strategy through software. The software [indiscernible] strategy that one of the most important investments a company can make is in the productivity of its software developers.\n\nConsequently, customers are gravitating towards MongoDB as their next generation developer data platform standard. Second, I see stable consumption growth going into next year. Atlas consumption trends have been steady for several quarters now, and we experienced less consumption variability in fiscal \u201824 compared to fiscal \u201823. Ultimately, the main driver of Atlas consumption is the growth in the underlying application usage and we see stable usage growth across our portfolio of workloads. Third, while I strongly believe that AI will be a significant driver of long-term growth for MongoDB, we are in the early days of AI, akin to the dial-up phase of the Internet era. To put things in context, it's important to understand that there are three layers to the AI stack.\n\nThe first layer is the underlying compute and LLMs. The second layer is the fine-tuning of models and building of AI applications. And the third layer is deploying and running applications that end users interact with. MongoDB\u2019s strategy is to operate at the second and third layers to enable customers to build AI applications by using their own proprietary data together with any LLM, close or open source, on any computing infrastructure. Today the vast majority of AI spend is happening in the first layer, that is investments in compute to train and run LLMs. Neither are areas in which we compete. Our enterprise customers today are still largely in the experimentation and prototyping stages of building their initial AI applications, first focus on driving efficiencies by automating existing workloads.\n\nWe expect that it will take time for enterprises to deploy production workloads at scale. However, as organizations look to realize the full benefit of these AI investments, they will turn to companies like MongoDB, offering differentiated capabilities in the upper layers of the AI stack. Similar to what happened in the internet era, when value accrued over time to companies offering services and applications leveraging the built-out Internet infrastructure, platforms like MongoDB will benefit as customers build AI applications to drive meaningful operating efficiencies, create compelling customer experiences, and pursue new growth opportunities. We already see our platform resonating with innovative AI startups building exciting applications for use cases such as real-time patient diagnostics for personalized medicine, cyber threat data analysis for risk mitigation, predictive maintenance for maritime fleets, and auto-generated animations for personalized marketing campaigns.\n\nFinally, our competitive position is getting stronger. Our win rates remain very high across all competitors. We rarely compete with legacy database providers as enterprises understand that they need to move away from inefficient and brittle legacy technology. We also rarely run into niche database players since customers are overwhelmed by the proliferation of point solutions that are hard to manage and add limited value. Our main competition remains the cloud players. They offer a wide array of database options, relational and non-relational, and benefit from their size and reach. We compete well against these players due to the flexibility and scalability of our document architecture. The fact that our open platform can run anywhere and avoids lock-in and MongoDB's popularity among developers all around the world.\n\nFinally, when you look at our newer products, we see increased success competing against the established players in those markets. We find that the same principle applies as in the core database market. Customers don't want to manage a myriad of point solutions and prefer consolidating their spend with strategic vendors, especially in the current cost conscious environment. In summary, we expect the environment in fiscal \u201825 to be largely similar to the environment we experienced in fiscal \u201824. With that backdrop, let me tell you what our priorities are going to next year. First, we'll continue pressing our product advantage in the core database, since we believe customers will place an even greater premium on performance and scalability in the AI enabled world.\n\nIn addition, we'll continue maturing our newer products, including additional features of Vector Search, GA of Atlas Stream Processing, and enhancements to other offerings. Second, we will remain singularly focused on new workload acquisition as the key long-term driver of our business. We will continue fine-tuning incentives to ensure that our entire go-to-market organization is focused on identifying and sourcing new workload opportunities. In addition, we will leverage our expertise and learnings from our self-serve business to use product-led growth techniques to increase the adoption of Atlas by other development teams within our existing large enterprise accounts. Third, we are focused on growing sales capacity. As we told you in the past, we were slow to grow capacity in fiscal \u201824, especially in the first half due to macro uncertainty.\n\nGiven that the market is more stable now and that we remain under-penetrated compared to our opportunity, we'll increase the pace of go-to-market investments in fiscal \u201825. Fourth, we will continue investing to become a standard in more of our customer base. We intend to double the size of our strategic account program and dramatically expand our account-based marketing efforts in our largest accounts. Finally, we remain focused on locking the relational migration opportunity. To remind everyone, there are three elements to migrating an application, transforming the schema, moving the data, and rewriting the application code. Our current relational migrator offering is designed to automate large parts of the first two elements, but rewriting application code is the most manually intensive element.\n\nGenAI holds tremendous promise to meaningfully reduce the cost and time of rewriting application code. We will continue building AI capabilities into Relational Migrator, but our view is that the end solution will be a mix of products and services. This year, we are investing in a number of pilots leveraging AI for relational migrations paired with services to substantially simplify and scale the process. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries around the world are running mission-critical projects on MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of a developer data platform, including ZF, Forbes, and Swiss Federal Railways. ZF, a global technology company supplying systems for passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and industrial technology, needed a central database solution with broad functionality to support more than 300,000 commercial vehicles connected to ZF infrastructure.\n\nZF originally began using MongoDB on-premise in 2014 and migrated to MongoDB Atlas to modernize the architecture behind its new fleet orchestration solution. The team now uses time series and online archive to reduce the overall data storage size, as well as MongoDB Atlas Search to manage indexes and Atlas Charts to display billing information. MongoDB's developer data platform enables ZF to release new features faster as innovative technologies like drones and autonomous vehicles continue to come to market. In any -- PicPay and Anywhere Real Estate are examples of customers turning to MongoDB to free up the developers' time for innovation while achieving significant cost savings. Anywhere Real Estate, a global leader in residential real estate services whose brand portfolio includes Better Homes and Gardens, Century 21, Coldwell Banker, Corcoran, ERA, Sotheby's International Realty, is leveraging MongoDB Atlas and Atlas Search to greatly enhance its search capabilities. A software engineer hosting a remote video training session on a multi-cloud database-as-a-service solution.\n\nTheir previous solution was too costly and operationally burdensome to maintain. Now with Atlas Search, they can ingest data from hundreds of MLS sources, aggregate the data and provide customers with a search solution that efficiently delivers accurate and up-to-date information, saving time and lowering costs. Anywhere is also exploring the use of Atlas Vector Search to provide semantic search and GenAI features to millions of consumers. Samsung Electronics, ArcelorMittal and Citizens Bank are turning to MongoDB to marinize applications. Samsung Electronics digital appliances division transitioned from their previous MySQL database to MongoDB Atlas to manage their clients data more effectively. By leveraging MongoDB's document model, Samsung\u2019s smart home service can collect real-time data from the team's AI-powered home appliances and use it for a variety of data-driven initiatives such as training AI services.\n\nTheir migration to MongoDB Atlas improved response times by more than 50% and disk read latency was reduced from 3 seconds to 18 millisecond, significantly improving availability and developer productivity. Let me wrap up by saying that I remain highly confident about our ability to execute on our long-term growth opportunity. We are pursuing one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software, with significant expansion opportunities in both new and existing customer accounts. While it's early days, we expect that AI will not only support the overall growth of the market, but also compel customers to revisit both their legacy workloads and build more ambitious applications. This will allow us to win more new and existing workloads and to ultimately continue to establish MongoDB as a standard in enterprise accounts.\n\nBefore I turn it over to Michael, I would like to personally invite all of you to attend the investor session at MongoDB.localNYC to be held at the Javits Center on May 2nd. Please email ir@mongodb.com if you're interested in attending. With that, here's Michael.\n\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $458 million, up 27% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance. As Dev mentioned, we had another quarter of healthy new business acquisition, demonstrating our product market fit and the mission criticality of our platform. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 34% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 65% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and 66% last quarter.\n\nWe recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform, and that consumption is closely related to end user activity of the application. As a reminder, in Q4 fiscal \u201823, we had a higher than normal amount of revenue from unused commitments, making this a tough year-over-year comparison. Excluding the impact of unused commitments, Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4 was in line with the growth that we observed in Q3. Let me provide some additional context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. As we shared in our guidance last quarter, we were expecting consumption to be impacted by the seasonal slowdown in Q4 around the holidays. Week-over-week consumption growth in Q4 was stronger than in Q4 of last year and in line with our expectations.\n\nWe've seen less consumption variability this year, and so as in Q3 we forecasted less of a seasonal impact than in prior years and that's exactly what we saw. Turning to non-Atlas revenue, EA exceeded our expectations in the quarter and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. Ongoing EA strength speaks to the appeal and success of our run anywhere strategy. The EA revenue app performance was in part a result of more multi-year deals than we had expected. As a reminder, the term license component for multi-year deals is recognized as upfront revenue at the start of the contract and therefore includes term license revenue related to future years. Turning to customer growth, during the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,400 customers sequentially bringing our total customer count to over 47,800, which is up from over 40,800 in the year-ago period.\n\nOf our total customer count, over 7,000 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,400 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 46,300 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 39,300 in the year-ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth of our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. Moving on to ARR, we had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,052 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,651 in the year-ago period. We also finished the year with 259 customers spending a million dollars or more annualized on our platform compared to over 213 a year ago.\n\nMoving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $353.6 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is down from 78% in the year-ago period. As we said at the time, our gross margin in the year-ago period reflected a one-time benefit of roughly 2.5 percentage points related to one of our cloud partner contracts. Our income from operations was $69.2 million, or a 15% operating margin for the fourth quarter, compared to a 10% margin in the year-ago period. Our strong bottom-line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and are a clear indication of the strength in our underlying unit economics. The primary reason for our operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance.\n\nNet income in the fourth quarter was $71.1 million, or $0.86 per share, based on 82.9 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to net income of $46.4 million, or $0.57 per share, on 80.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the fourth quarter with $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $54.6 million and $121.5 million for the full fiscal year 2024. After taking into consideration approximately $4.1 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $50.5 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $23.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nFor the full fiscal year \u201824, free cash flow was $109.9 million compared to negative $24.7 million in fiscal \u201823. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $436 million to $440 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $22 million to $25 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.39 based on 83.8 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $186 million to $201 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.27 to $2.49, based on 85.1 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n\nNote that the non-GAAP income per share guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context on our guidance, starting with the full year fiscal \u201825, where we're facing difficult compares in two ways. First, we expect to recognize close to zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments in fiscal 25, compared to over $40 million in fiscal \u201824. As you may recall, in fiscal \u201824, we changed our sales incentive structure to reduce the importance of upfront commitments. And so we saw far fewer upfront commitments. Therefore, as those fiscal \u201925 -- \u201824 deals come up for renewal in fiscal \u201825, we expect to see limited revenue related to unused commitments.\n\nSecond, in fiscal \u201824, we recognized approximately $40 million more in multiyear license revenue than we did in fiscal \u201823. As you know, our fiscal year \u201824 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a higher-than-usual amount of license revenue related to multi-year contracts, including our extended partnership with Alibaba. Clearly we are pleased with the fiscal \u201824 performance, but it was unusual in terms of the magnitude of multi-year deals and we don't expect similar performance in fiscal \u201825. As a result, we expect non-Atlas revenues to be modestly down in fiscal \u201825. Next, we expect Atlas consumption growth to be in line with the consumption growth we've experienced in fiscal \u201824. Finally, I want to provide some context to better understand our operating margin guidance.\n\nThe $80-plus-million of fiscal \u201824 revenue that won't repeat in fiscal \u201825 was very high margin, making for an exceptionally tough operating margin compare. In addition, as we mentioned in the past, in fiscal \u201824 we began increasing our pace of hiring relatively late in the year. So the full cost from those investments will impact our fiscal \u201825 operating margin. We're expecting headcount growth in the mid-teens versus 9% growth in fiscal \u201824. And as Dev mentioned, we are prioritizing growth in sales productive capacity. Consequently, we expect to see a year-over-year operating margin decline while still delivering 500 basis points of margin expansion on a two year basis. We believe this is the most appropriate way to understand our continued margin progression.\n\nMoving on to our Q1 guidance, a few things to keep in mind. First, we expect Atlas revenue to be flat to slightly down sequentially. Q1 has two fewer days than Q4 this year, which represents a revenue headwind. Also, the slower Atlas consumption growth during the holidays will have a bigger impact on Q1 revenue than it did in Q4, thereby negatively impacting sequential revenue growth. Finally, the sequential impact from the expected decline in unused Atlas commitments will be most pronounced in Q1, given that we made the changes in Q1 of last year. Second, we expect to see a meaningful sequential decline in EA revenue. As discussed in past years, Q4 is our seasonally highest quarter in terms of our EA renewal base, which is an excellent indicator of our ability to win new EA business.\n\nIn Q1, the EA renewal base is sequentially much lower. Finally, we expect operating income to decline sequentially due to lower revenue as well as our increased pace of hiring. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong fourth quarter results. We're pleased with our ability to win new business and see stable consumption trends in Atlas. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and will continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar in 2024: Here Are My Top 5 Software Growth Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "Since stocks began trading on the Nasdaq, the index has produced negative annual returns only 14 times. What's more, the index has dropped by at least 30% on just three occasions over the last two decades.\n\nWhat investors might not realize is that following these steep drops in 2002 and 2008, the Nasdaq went on a rally for consecutive years thereafter.\n\nSimilarly, following a harsh 2022, the Nasdaq rebounded sharply last year -- returning 43%. This was largely driven by euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) in the tech industry. With 2024 getting off to a red-hot start, further gains could be in store for investors.\n\nWhile each of the stocks below enjoyed AI-driven momentum in 2023, I think all of them look appealing given the long-term secular growth prospects in artificial intelligence\u00a0for software developers.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nThe first company on my list is a staple among Cathie Wood's exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) develops a host of data analytics software tools that it sells to the U.S. government and its Western allies, as well as to the private sector.\n\n2023 was a transformational year for Palantir as the company released its fourth flagship product: the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Management developed a creative lead generation strategy to get the word out about AIP, as the market had become flooded with competing products. Palantir began hosting immersive seminars called boot camps during which prospective customers can demo its software and identify a use case for AI.\n\nSince AIP's launch last April, Palantir has hosted more than 500 boot camps. To put this into perspective, the company had 92 demo pilots in all of 2022. While the demand to attend boot camps is impressive, the conversion to actual paying customers is even more encouraging.\n\nPalantir grew its customer count by 35% year over year in 2023. The rapid adoption of customer acquisition has fueled meaningful margin expansion and free-cash-flow generation for Palantir. The company is consistently profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, and ended 2023 with $3.7 billion in cash and no debt on its balance sheet.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.5, Palantir stock isn't exactly cheap. However, investors should realize that over the last few weeks the stock has experienced some momentum given the company's blowout fourth-quarter report. Nevertheless, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities still sees substantial upside in Palantir stock given the company's initial success with AI.\n\nSo even though Palantir stock is trading at a premium, I think it's warranted. Long-term investors may want to scoop up some shares in Palantir as the company quietly emerges as a winner in the AI landscape.\n\n2. ServiceNow\n\nNext up on the list is IT data management company ServiceNow(NYSE: NOW). One of the core pillars for corporate executives is having the ability to make data-driven decisions efficiently.\n\nThe challenge facing large enterprises is that they typically rely on several different platforms to store data. Unfortunately, these systems rarely communicate with one another easily -- putting decision-makers in a difficult position. ServiceNow helps businesses transform their operations by seamlessly connecting their data across digital platforms.\n\nAccording to IT research firm Gartner, $6.5 trillion will be spent on technology services by 2027. Even better? IT services and software are expected to account for the majority of this spend. That is a really good sign for ServiceNow. Considering the company is already doing a stellar job acquiring new customers and expanding its existing base, things could just be getting started as AI plays a major role in enterprise digital transformation.\n\nAt a recent P/S ratio of 17.7, ServiceNow is trading relatively in line with its long-term average. I see the stock as undervalued, and think ServiceNow is overlooked among leading software-as-a-service (SaaS) investment opportunities. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce (NYSE: CRM) was the top performing stock in the Dow Jones last year. What makes Salesforce unique is its portfolio of different businesses that it has acquired.\n\nWhile these deals were initially cheered, ongoing integration efforts and stalled monetization eventually took a toll on investor enthusiasm. However, as IT budgets are increasingly allocating more capital toward artificial intelligence, Salesforce may have just unlocked its newest opportunity.\n\nThe company is marketing itself as an end-to-end AI-powered ecosystem for workplace productivity, stitched together through its platforms MuleSoft, Tableau, and Slack. While it's still early innings, Salesforce is already showing some accelerated growth due to the influence AI is having on enterprise tech stacks.\n\nI think Salesforce is going through a bit of a renaissance, and the company looks well positioned to continue growing in the long run as it offers a much more sophisticated, full-spectrum platform for workplace automation tools compared to its peers.\n\n4. Datadog\n\nDatadog(NASDAQ: DDOG) is an emerging player in the cloud computing industry. The company offers a cloud monitoring platform to help keep data safe and secure. DDOG Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nIn 2023, Datadog grew its top line 27% year over year to $2.1 billion. While revenue growth is forecast to slow over the next couple of years, the trade-off is that management is calling for expanding operating profits.\n\nI'll take modestly slowing revenue in exchange for long-term sustained profitability. At a recent P/S of just 21.8, Datadog stock is trading at a steep discount compared to its 10-year average of 31. Now could be a terrific opportunity buy shares in Datadog stock as the company moves toward becoming a more mature, profitable business.\n\n5. MongoDB\n\nThe last company on my list is NoSQL database management platform MongoDB(NASDAQ: MDB). As of the end of the company's fiscal third quarter of 2024, ended Oct. 31, 2023, MongoDB had approximately 46,400 customers -- an increase of 19% year over year.\n\nThe acceleration of customer acquisition and top-line growth of 30% has helped MongoDB erase its losses. For the nine months ended Oct. 31, 2023, MongoDB generated $59.4 million in free cash flow. By comparison, the company's free cash flow was negative $48.6 million through the first nine months of 2022.\n\nAt a P/S of 19.4, MongoDB is trading slightly below its 10-year average. Furthermore, given the addressable market for database software is expected to reach $189 billion by 2030, MongoDB's growth prospects look robust. Now could be an interesting time to begin building a position in MongoDB stock and preparing to hold for the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Salesforce wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Does This Valuation Of MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for MongoDB is US$328 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity MongoDB is estimated to be 30% overvalued based on current share price of US$427 Our fair value estimate is 30% lower than MongoDB's analyst price target of US$470\n\nHow far off is MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for MongoDB\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$96.9m US$222.8m US$327.7m US$531.0m US$737.4m US$1.05b US$1.29b US$1.50b US$1.69b US$1.85b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x9 Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Est @ 23.00% Est @ 16.78% Est @ 12.44% Est @ 9.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4%  US$90.3 US$193 US$265 US$399 US$516 US$682 US$781 US$850 US$889 US$906\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.6b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$1.9b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.4%\u2013 2.3%) = US$37b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$37b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$18b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$24b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$427, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at MongoDB as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.111. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for MongoDB\n\nStrength\n\nCash in surplus of total debt.\n\nWeakness\n\nExpensive based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nHas sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.\n\nThreat\n\nDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

        "content": "If timing entries are not your forte, having a shortlist of growth stocks to buy may be for you.\n\nGrowth stocks offer some of the best returns in the market. For example, last year\u2019s \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d, including Google, Meta, and Amazon, pushed the S&P500 to all-time highs. While that\u2019s impressive, some investors might not want to buy into overcrowded\u2014and potentially overvalued\u2014stocks. The great thing is that we\u2019re not limited to mega-cap growth stocks, as there are dozens of smaller companies with just as much growth potential\u2014maybe even more. This article will examine three growth stocks that are consistently growing and beating their earnings.\n\nBlue Bird Corporation (BLBD)\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/kali9\n\nMarket and sector leaders are excellent places to start when looking for growth stocks. For example, Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ:BLBD) is a leader in electric and low-emission school bus manufacturing. The company operates in two segments: the bus segment for its manufacturing and assembly of buses for its U.S., Canada, and international clients, and the parts segment for its parts sale of third-party parts to its network and large fleet customers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlue Bird owns over 20,000 propane, electric-powered, and natural gas buses. The company also recently announced receiving record orders of 180 electric school buses, highlighting their growing demand.\n\nHeadlining BLBD\u2019s recent financials are a 35% YoY growth in net sales and a massive 332% increase in net income, from an $11.30 million loss to a $26.20 million profit. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA reached record highs of $47.60 million, a significant increase of $51.1 million compared to last year. Sold buses reached 2,129, representing a 9% rise.\n\nDue to these impressive results, management increased 2024\u2019s full-year EBITDA guidance to $130 million. Blue Bird is poised to grow alongside massive global supply chain recoveries and an accelerating demand for eco-friendly transportation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AZEK Company Inc. (AZEK) Residential neighborhood subdivision skyline Aerial shot\n\nSource: TDKvisuals / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors seeking growth stocks with shades of ESG should look at The AZEK Company Inc. (NYSE:AZEK). The company designs and manufactures outdoor products under its two main segments: the residential segment for its decking, rail, trim, and accessories, and the commercial segment for its resin-based extruded sheeting products that are used for a variety of applications for its original equipment manufacturers. Its brands include AZEK, ULTRALOX, VERSATEX, and TimberTech.\n\nAZEK\u2019s latest reported consolidated net sales rose 11% YoY, reaching $240.40 million. This was primarily driven by a notable 24% increase in residential segment net sales. This growth and a noteworthy decrease in the cost of sales resulted in a YoY reversal from a $27.63 million comprehensive loss to a $22.62 million profit.\n\nThe company also initiated a $100 million accelerated share repurchase program, affirming its positive stance on providing shareholder value. In terms of forecast, the company raised its fiscal 2024 outlook for net sales to be between $1.385 and $1.425 billion and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $353 to $372 million. This strong show of confidence and excellent financial growth to back it up makes AZEK one of the more attractive growth stocks to keep tabs on.\n\nMongoDB (MDB) A close-up view of the MongoDB (MDB) office in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast but not least on our list of growth stocks to buy is MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB). Mongo is an emerging name in cloud computing thanks to its innovative database product. Its main product is MongoDB Atlas, a product I\u2019ve used myself. It enables customers to automate the provisioning of databases and offers 360-degree monitoring software along with enterprise-level backups, among other features.\n\nMongoDB recently announced its membership as a founding U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium member. It also doubled down on its competitive advantage thanks to its release of the Atlas Vector Search, which allows semantic searches with structured and unstructured data and generative AI capabilities.\n\nMDB reported their latest quarterly financials on December 5, 2023. Total revenue was up 30% YoY, with MongoDB Atlas making up the majority with a 66% share. Atlas revenue was also up 36%, making it a key area for future growth. President and CEO Dev Ittycheria expressed satisfaction with its ability to secure new workloads across various sectors and geographies, solidifying its pivotal role in organizations\u2019 tech stacks.\n\nCompany guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 is optimistic, particularly with revenue and non-GAAP income. MDB\u2019s strong momentum and expansive market positioning make it one of the top growth stocks to buy right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why Datadog, Snowflake, and Other Cloud Stocks Rallied on Friday",
        "content": "One of the hallmarks of the recent economic downturn was a pause in the digital transformation, marked by a dramatic pullback in cloud spending, as companies turned to cloud optimization in an effort to more efficiently use their existing services. The financial results released by one company today suggest that customers are beginning to pile back into cloud services, which could mark the end of a historic dry spell.\n\nAs of 2:56 p.m. ET on Friday, Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG) stock had risen 3.6%, Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) had climbed 4.9%, and MongoDB(NASDAQ: MDB) had jumped 6.5%.\n\nA check of all the usual sources -- regulatory filings, earnings results, and changes to analysts' price targets -- turned up nothing in the way of company-specific news to explain the moves. Rather, it was the robust results of a rival cloud provider that helped propel them higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA rebound in cloud spending?\n\nRoaring out of the gate this morning was Cloudflare. The cloud and edge computing specialist reported fourth-quarter revenue that grew 32% year over year to $362.5 million, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 150% to $0.15. This was well ahead of analysts' consensus estimates of $353 million and EPS of $0.12, and investors let out a collective cheer -- driving the stock up more than 20% (as of this writing).\n\nCloudflare also reported metrics that suggested cloud customers were opening their wallets. The company signed a record number of customers spending $500,000 and $1 million, as new annual contract value (ACV) soared 40%, marking the fastest pace of growth since 2021.\n\nThis continued a recent trend, suggesting that businesses are beginning to put the downturn behind them and resume spending on cloud computing services.\n\nHow will other cloud stocks benefit?\n\nA general rebound in cloud spending will benefit each of these cloud providers:\n\nDatadog provides an expanding and integrated suite of cloud monitoring, analytics, and security tools that help customers keep their sites up and running while spotting anomalies before they result in critical downtime. Last quarter, the company cited strong growth of larger customers, and Cloudflare's results suggest that trend is continuing. Snowflake's cloud-based data warehouse and analytics platform offers consumption-based pricing, which let users dial down their spending when the economy tanked. As conditions improve, those same users will likely ramp up spending again, which bodes well for Snowflake. MongoDB offers cloud-centric database solutions that are much more robust than traditional databases. The company was recently named \"best-of-breed\" by D.A. Davidson analyst Rudy Kessinger, who called it \"the clear NoSQL market leader\" in a \"very attractive\" $80 billion database market.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore broadly, cloud spending is forecast to ramp back up in 2024 after a downturn-induced deceleration. Worldwide public cloud spending is expected to reach $679 billion in 2024, an increase of more than 20%, according to the technology research and consulting firm Gartner.\n\nAre cloud stocks a buy?\n\nTo be clear, none of these three stocks is cheap in terms of traditional valuation metrics. Snowflake, MongoDB, and Datadog are currently selling for 16 times, 14 times, and 13 times next year's sales, respectively, when a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is generally between 1 and 2.

        "content": "Despite challenges such as rising national debt, an aging population, and increased interest expenses, the positive future of the U.S. economy is underscored by recently enacted legislation to curb federal spending and stronger-than-expected economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s report indicates that annual deficits over the next decade are 7% smaller than previously forecast, partly due to a two-year deal to limit discretionary spending and a surge in new workers, primarily immigrants, entering the labor force.\n\nWhile the fiscal trajectory remains challenging, the slight improvement in the projections signals a more optimistic outlook for the U.S. economy. Investing in these big-data stocks has the potential to propel your portfolio to success, mirroring the achievements of our thriving economy.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is a SaaS company focused on the development of data integration and software solutions for the private and public sectors, primarily through the implementation of AI. Founded by people heavily involved in AI, such as Peter Thiel, Palantir has been among the most innovative companies in this sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQ4 2023 earnings records exceeded expectations, leading to a surge of nearly 20%. This has defied market expectations, with analysts expecting a potential downside of 27.097%. However, financial indicators, and certain institutions, suggest otherwise. On receiving Q4 earnings, Citigroup gave a neutral outlook on PLTR, an upgrade from the previous sell position. 70% YoY domestic revenue growth, GAAP net income of $93 million, with a 15% margin, and multiple other metrics indicate strong financial growth. 2023 was also the first fiscal year where Palantir posted a profit.\n\nWhile governmental interest in Palantir is drying up, the commercial market is propelling its growth. The company reports that it is expecting a revenue of $640 million from U.S. commercial markets, a 40% YoY increase. PLTR\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a data integration and analysis service for enterprises, has become a leading product.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the demand for AI solutions increases, Palantir has great growth potential. Continued innovation will lead to Palantir continuing to do great. Strong financials and growth outpacing Wall Street expectations make it a strong buy.\n\nMongoDB Inc.

(NASDAQ:MDB) offers a general-purpose database platform, which it hosts on the cloud, on-premise, and in a hybrid environment. Its stock currently trades for $457.39 and is up 105.45% from 12 months prior.\n\nMongoDB\u2019s products particularly stand out from its competitors due to their relevance to AI. Many organizations today are creating generative AI using large language models. To power these generative AI platforms, companies need to use vector databases that store data in numeric representations. To take advantage of this trend, MongoDB released the MongoDB Atlas vector search. The tool uses machine learning to navigate these databases, providing users with high accuracy of information and accelerated data indexing.\n\nWith its strong competitive advantage in AI capabilities, MongoDB reported $432.9 million in revenue, a 30% increase YoY. The company also continued its strong customer growth and now has 46,400 customers compared to 39,100 12 months ago.\n\nIn summary, generative AI provides a huge opportunity for MongoDB. Combined with its double-digit revenue and customer growth, these factors position the company for success.\n\nDatadog Inc.

(NASDAQ:DDOG) is an observability and security platform for cloud applications and provides infrastructure monitoring, database monitoring, cloud security management, and more. Currently, large amounts of data are collected every day and companies require data analytics platforms to understand the information. Combined with high levels of cloud adoption across enterprises, these factors are driving growth in the observability tools and platforms market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.7% until 2028. Datadog, a key player in this market, stands to benefit. Its stock has already shot up 62.62% in the past 12 months and currently trades for $130.62.\n\nDatadog is currently experiencing strong growth, and management expects it to continue. For Q3 2023, the company reported revenue of $547.5 million, up 25% YoY. For Q4 2024, management predicts revenue to be as high as $568 million which would be a YoY increase of 21%. In addition to revenue growth, Datadog has been focusing on profitability. In Q3 2023, the company achieved a gross margin of 82.3% compared to a gross margin of 81.3% in Q2 2023 and 79.7% in Q3 2022.\n\nMoreover, Datadog recently released a generative AI copilot, Bits AI, which helps users identify relevant Datadog workflows to solve issues. Bits AI\u2019s natural language capabilities can facilitate deeper investigations to draw meaningful information from large amounts of data, streamline incident response, and prevent issues from recurring.\n\nTo summarize, Datadog\u2019s strong growth, increasing profitability, and AI integration make it a compelling investment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
