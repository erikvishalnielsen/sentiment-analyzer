        "title": "Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 weekly preview: Recession fears cloud equities outlook",
        "content": "Stocks fell sharply on Friday following a surprisingly weak July jobs report, fueling concerns about a potential economic recession.\n\nThe broad market index dropped 1.84% to close at 5,346.56. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.43% to 16,776.16, marking a decline of over 10% from its recent peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 610.71 points, or 1.51%, ending the day at 39,737.26.\n\nThe sell-off came as investors reacted to a significant slowdown in U.S. job growth for July, coupled with a rise in the unemployment rate to its highest level since October 2021. According to the Labor Department, nonfarm payrolls increased by only 114,000 in July, down from 179,000 in June and falling short of the 185,000 forecasted by economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nThe Nasdaq has now entered correction territory, having dropped more than 10% from its all-time high. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow are 5.7% and 3.9% below their record highs, respectively.\n\nThe negative sentiment persisted on Monday, with all major stock futures trading in the red as Japan\u2019s Nikkei and Topix indexes each plummeted more than 12%.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the favorite AI-related stocks and the key driving force behind the recent bull market, saw its shares tumble 13% in premarket trading.\n\nThe sharp sell-off prompted economists to reevaluate their interest rate cut predictions as they believe the Federal Reserve will now have to act earlier than expected to support a slowing economy. Goldman Sachs anticipates three consecutive 25 basis points cuts by year-end in September, November, and December.\n\nLooking ahead to this week, investors will focus on key economic indicators for further insights into trends, particularly the ISM services report on Monday and the jobless claims report on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that the ISM services index rebounded 1.7pt to 50.5 in July, reflecting partial convergence toward our non-manufacturing survey tracker (which stands at 52.3 for July) but a potential headwind from seasonality,\u201d Goldman economists said in a note.\n\nIn addition, several Fed officials will speak in the coming days.\n\nThis week's earnings spotlight: SMCI, Caterpillar , Walt Disney\n\nApart from the disappointing July employment data, investors are also concerned about the elevated valuations in the wake of the AI rally, with rising geopolitical risks in the Middle East also adding to the risk-off sentiment.\n\nAlthough all Big Tech companies have already unveiled their latest earnings, several other important reports are expected this week.\n\nSpecifically, this includes earnings reports from Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), The Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co., and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), among others.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nBTIG: \u201cIt's been a long time coming, but the fulcrum from markets trading 'bad news is good' to 'bad is bad' appears to be here. Therefore, lower rates are likely to be met with lower stock prices, as we have seen over the last couple of days. As far as the SPX goes, the recent pullback gets us closer to a possible washout, but we still see some risk towards 5200. Internals have weakened, but given the rotation into defensives, they remain far from what we typically see at tradable lows.\u201d\n\nWedbush: \u201cWe are getting inbounds from investors around the world today/over the weekend asking us if this tech bull market and historic run for tech stocks is over? It's NOT in our view and this is just a white knuckle moment in a multi-year bull run for tech stocks that need hand holding. We have battled through this bull/bear debate a number of times over the past few years as well as the last few decades covering tech stocks on the Street. Our view its a soft landing environment, the Fed is in a major cutting cycle the next 18 months, AI represents a new build out for the tech world not seen since the start of the Internet, AND this is not a bubble and tech vendors will start to show the monetization/use cases/growth over the next 6-9 months to validate the valuations.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley: \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that valuations are sensitive to earnings revisions breadth, which turned negative last month. The last time S&P 500 earnings revisions breadth rolled over into negative territory was last fall. Between July and October 2023, the market multiple declined from 20x to 17x. Two weeks ago, the P/E was 22x, and it is now at 20x. If earnings revisions continue to fade, as the seasonal trends suggest they will, it\u2019s likely these valuations have further to fall. With our 12-month base case target multiple at 19x, the risk/reward for equities broadly remains unfavorable. Under the surface of the market, we continue to recommend a quality + defensive (rather than growth) bias.\u201d\n\nRBC Capital Markets: \u201cWe\u2019ve thought a pullback in the S&P 500 would likely settle out in the 5-10% range. Ones significantly more than that in recent decades tend to be associated with growth scares (10-20% declines) or recessions (which most pullbacks 20% or more end up being associated with). We still have questions about the jobs report, specifically on weather. For now, 10% remains our assumption for how deep a pullback could go but we\u2019re monitoring the jobs discussion closely for risk of a growth scare settling in given how skittish investors appear to be.\u201d\n\nUBS: \u201cSimilar to what we witnessed amidst the small-cap rotation a few weeks ago, the degree of moves was clearly exacerbated by stretched positioning, in our view. The difference today is there is fundamental backing to elevated levels of risk premia, from both a macro and earnings perspective. But have we gone too far, too fast? Aggressive rate cuts priced into the market post-NFPs and the coincident move in the front-end of the yield curve appears to be an overshooting, per our Rates Strategists. Our US Equity Strategists flagged that VIX > 25 has historically been a buying opportunity for stocks. We echo this sentiment, but note the risks appear to be skewed more asymmetrically to the downside.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWall St set to tumble as recession worries spook investors\n\nMagnificent Seven set to shed $1 trillion in value, led by Apple, Nvidia\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI Frenzy is Not Over: 5 Stocks in Focus at Lucrative Valuation",
        "content": "The astonishing rally of U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology across the world was the prime factor.\n\nAs expectations for a rate cut in September reached 100%, investors\u2019 preference shifted from these extremely overvalued AI stocks to the beaten-down rate-sensitive cyclical stocks. Moreover, fear of a recession, following the release of a few weaker-than-expected key economic data, raises concerns that big companies may not maintain their current level of gigantic expenditure for AI-related R&D.\n\nConsequently, AI stocks suffered the maximum brunt of a recent stock market meltdown. On Aug 2, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite entered into correction territory as it fell more than 10% from its recent high recorded on Jul 11.\n\nIs Recession Nearby or a Knee-Jerk Expression?\n\nTheoretically a recession means contraction of GDP (negative GDP growth rate) for two consecutive quarters. The U.S. GDP grew at 1.4% in first-quarter 2024. The first reading of second-quarter GDP was 2.8%. On Aug 1, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow projected a 2.5% GDP growth rate for the third quarter.\n\nSome soft key economic data over a period of time never indicate a nearby recession. In fact, the Fed was eagerly waiting for these weak economic data, especially labor market data, along with a gradually declining inflation rate, in order to initiate a rate-cut regime.\n\nFinally, the recent AI turmoil is nothing but profit-taking, especially on the part of institutional investors. Stock markets consist of bull and bear operators. As bulls fly high, bears wait quietly for a suitable time and some reasons to be good enough for profit-booking so that they can reenter the market at a reasonably low level. Stock prices of most of the AI giants have skyrocketed 100-400% in the past 19 months. Therefore, the speculation of a market correction was rife in the last couple of months.\n\nAI Frenzy Remains Intact\n\nSo far, no negative news appears for the generative AI ecosystem. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI spending will increase from $67 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2032. PricewaterhouseCoopers International Ltd. estimated that AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion should come from consumption-side effects.\n\n5 AI Giants in Focus At an Attractive Level\n\nThe recent meltdown has made several AI bigwigs attractive from a long-term investment point of view. AI turmoil may continue for the next few days. Investors should keenly watch these five stocks to create a lucrative portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM has become a new poster boy on the global AI frenzy. The company is the largest manufacturer of AI-based chipsets for the world\u2019s best AI chipset developers. TSM reported excellent results for second-quarter 2024 beating both top and bottom lines estimates, supported by a 3-nanometer chipset boom.\n\nThe growing adoption of its multi-project wafer processing service, which allows customers to reduce mask costs, is driving its customer momentum. TSM\u2019s growing efforts to ramp up the production of 3nm and development of 2nm is a plus.\n\nFor third-quarter 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor projects revenues between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. The company also expects more than 20% growth in 2024 revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter and 2024 revenues is pegged at $22.72 billion and $85.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 31.5% and 23%, respectively.\n\nThe consensus mark for third-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at $1.69 per share, suggesting year-over-year growth of 31%. The estimate has been revised upward by 8.3% in the last 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.37 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.9%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.9% in the last 30 days.\n\nThe stock price has plunged 22.5% from its 52-week high. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 29.4% from the last closing price of $149.86. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$250. Thus, every dip has a strong upside potential. TSM currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is expected to benefit in two ways. Demand for its Hopper chips remains strong and an industry-wide shift from central processors to NVDA-made accelerators. This undisputed global leader in the generative AI chipset developer space is aggressively differentiating its products.\n\nOn May 22, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company\u2019s next-generation AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, would be the next driver. These chips will be available in data centers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Within the series, the B200 is 30 times speedier than its predecessor.\n\nOn Jun 2, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called \u201cRubin.\u201d Rubin is set to be introduced in 2026. NVIDIA will introduce an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027. On Jul 22, Reuters reported that the company is working on a B20 version of its flagship chipset for the Chinese market that would be compatible with current U.S. export restrictions.\n\nNVDA will report second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings results on Aug 28. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 30 days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 18.4%.\n\nThe stock price has slid 23.8% from its 52-week high. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 29.4% from the last closing price of $107.27. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $90-$200. Thus, every dip has a strong upside potential. NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. SMCI has benefited on the back of robust demand for severs powered by high-end generative AI chipsets. SMCI designs, develops, manufactures, and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.\n\nAn astonishing rise in demand for high-performance rack servers boosted SMCI\u2019s top and bottom lines. In order to support aggressive workloads, data centers are aggressively demanding high-density rack space and direct-to-chip liquid cooling.\n\nThe company makes servers using NVIDIA processors. Super Micro Computer is positioned as a leading provider of one-stop-shop, high-performance rack servers capable of powering advanced AI applications.\n\nSMCI\u2019s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI\u2019s Server Building Block Solutions provide benefits across many environments, including data center deployment, high-performance computing, high-end workstations, storage networks and standalone server installations.\n\nSuper Micro Computer will report fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 earnings results on Aug 6. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for last-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings has remained the same over the last 60 days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 7%.\n\nThe stock price has plummeted 49.2% from its 52-week high. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 53.1% from the last closing price of $624.65. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $325-$1,500. Super Micro Computer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron Technology Inc. MU has been benefiting from the enormous growth of AI applications that boosted demand for its high bandwidth memory chips. MU is a major producer of memory chips used in NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs. MU is benefiting from improved market conditions, robust sales executions and strong growth across multiple business units.\n\nMicron Technology anticipates the pricing of DRAM and NAND chips to increase, thereby improving its revenues. The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI servers, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supplies. Also, 5G adoption in IoT devices and wireless infrastructure will spur demand for memory and storage.\n\nMicron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 60.4% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings have improved 13.7% and 26.1, respectively, over the last 60 days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 73.2%.\n\nThe stock price has tumbled 41.2% from its 52-week high. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 61.8i% from the last closing price of $92.70. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $100-$225. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSnowflake Inc. SNOW is a major company providing cloud infrastructure to AI-based ecosystems. SNOW\u2019s platform offers Data Cloud, which enables customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data-driven applications, and share data and data products applying AI for solving business problems.\n\nSNOW helps large enterprises using multiple public cloud services and their own servers to aggregate data into a \u201cdata pool\u201d that produces a single source of information. Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI platform enables businesses to fine-tune models for their specific use, search unstructured data, and use AI to produce valuable insights. SNOW also offers its \u201cCopilot\u201d tool with Cortex AI architecture.\n\nSnowflake will report second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings results on Aug 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 6.7% over the last 30 days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 74.8%.\n\nThe stock price has plunged 49.6% from its 52-week high. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 57.3% from the last closing price of $119.77. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $105-$240.

        "title": "AI Stock Sell-Off: 3 Tech Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Just a few weeks after the Nasdaq Composite reached a new record high, tech investors are suddenly singing a different tune. The tech-heavy index is now down more than 8% from its peak on a combination of concerns that valuations are stretched after the earlier surge, doubts about the near-term monetization of AI, and a rotation to small-cap stocks, which have underperformed, in anticipation of interest rate cuts from the Fed.\n\nDespite the sell-off, many of the AI stocks that have reported quarterly results thus far this earnings season have delivered solid numbers even though market sentiment seems to be shifting against them. On that note, let's take a look at three AI stocks worth buying as prices come down. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, as it's also known, is a linchpin of the global economy. It is by far the largest contract manufacturer of semiconductors in the world, handling production for companies like Nvidia, Apple, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, and others.\n\nTaiwan Semi stock is now down 20% from its peak a few weeks ago even though the company delivered an impressive second-quarter earnings report in mid-July. Second-quarter revenue jumped 40%, or 33% in dollars, to $20.8 billion, and earnings per share rose 36%.\n\nTSMC is benefiting from both the broader cyclical recovery in the chip sector and increasing demand for AI and advanced chips. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer chips or smaller, made up 67% of total wafer revenue in the quarter.\n\nDue to its dominant market share in third-party chip manufacturing, advanced technologies, and customer relationships, TSMC has formidable competitive advantages, and it should be a winner no matter what happens with AI chips.\n\nThe stock also looks reasonably priced at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 30, which looks like a great price considering its current growth rate.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nLike TSMC, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock pulled back after the company's latest earnings report even as the search giant topped estimates on the top and bottom lines. Instead, investors were disappointed with slower-than-expected revenue growth at YouTube and concerned about an increase in capital expenditure to build out the company's AI infrastructure.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's results were strong. It showed 14% revenue growth to $84.7 billion, and earnings per share rose from $1.44 to $1.89.\n\nAlphabet is executing well across its business. It's controlling headcount growth to drive expanding operating margins. It's now reporting strong profits in Google Cloud, where it was losing money only a little more than a year ago. And it has kept pace in the AI race with OpenAI and others, deploying the new Gemini chatbot and an AI assistant in search.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, its Waymo autonomous vehicle subsidiary is the leader in that emerging technology.\n\nYou might think Alphabet would trade at a premium to the S&P 500, given its growth rate and potential in new technologies. But at the time of writing, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.4, a great price to pay for a proven winner.\n\n3. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) peaked back in March when the company was selected to join the S&P 500, but its share price has drifted lower since then after surging early in the year and late last year. The stock is down 46% from that peak, and it appears to be oversold pending its upcoming fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings report on August 6.\n\nSupermicro, as the company is also called, might be the fastest-growing AI stock after Nvidia. In its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue growth of 201%, and adjusted earnings per share more than quadrupled year over year.\n\nThe company makes high-density servers that work especially well for running AI applications, which has driven its growth over the last year. It also enjoys a close relationship with Nvidia, enabling it to get needed supplies of GPUs and other components.\n\nDespite its skyrocketing growth rate, Supermicro's valuation looks relatively modest at a P/E of around 37, and analysts expect the blistering growth to continue. If the company can deliver strong results in its upcoming earnings report, the stock could bounce up from its current level.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "US stock futures sink as economic jitters persist, tech rout continues",
        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell in evening deals on Sunday amid persistent concerns over an economic slowdown and technology stocks continued to grapple with extended profit-taking.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.9% to 5,329.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 1.4% to 18,302.0 points by 19:28 ET (23:28 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.5% to 39,680.0 points.\n\nSlowdown fears batter Wall Street\n\nLosses in Wall Street futures came after U.S. stocks were walloped by fears of an economic slowdown last week.\n\nA string of weak readings- on business activity and the labor market- ramped up concerns that the Federal Reserve had kept interest rates high for too long, and that chances of a soft landing for the economy were fading.\n\nThis notion came to a head on Friday after nonfarm payrolls data for July missed expectations by a wide margin, indicating a substantial cooling in the labor market.\n\nWhile the data did drive up hopes for more interest rate cuts by the Fed, it inspired little appetite for risk-driven assets.\n\nSelling also remained largely biased towards technology stocks, with the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite falling 2.4% to 16,776.16 points on Friday. The index was now down more than 10% from a record high hit earlier in the year.\n\nLosses in tech saw the S&P 500 sink 1.8% to 5,346.56 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has relatively less tech weightage than its peers, fell 1.5% to 39,737.26 points.\n\nEconomic cues, more earnings on tap\n\nAfter a Fed meeting last week, where the central bank kept rates unchanged but signaled a September cut, markets will be watching for more cues from a string of Fed speakers through this week.\n\nSome economic data is also on tap this week, with non-manufacturing purchasing managers index data from the Institute of Supply Management due on Monday.\n\nIn company earnings, industrial bellwether Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) and ride sharing major Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) are due on Tuesday.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI)- which saw a major valuation spike on hype over artificial intelligence- is also due on Tuesday, while media majors Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) are due on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures sink as economic jitters persist, tech rout continues\n\nEarnings call: ZimVie maintains guidance amid Q2 revenue of $117 million\n\nEarnings call: Frontdoor boasts record margins and robust Q2 2024 results\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Fears over the economy are set to remain to the fore amid worries that the Federal Reserve may have left interest rates elevated for too long, allowing them to hurt growth. More high-profile earnings reports are due and oil prices look set to remain volatile amid a combination of recession fears and geopolitical risks. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead.\n\nU.S. data, Fed speakers\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s weak July jobs report stoked fears over the prospect of a recession the economic calendar for the week ahead is considerably lighter.\n\nThe Institute of Supply Management releases its service sector index on Monday which is expected to point to modest growth.\n\nInvestors will get a fresh update on the state of the labor market on Thursday, with the weekly report on initial jobless claims, which are expected to pull back just slightly from an almost one-year high.\n\nInvestors will also get a chance to hear from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin after the central bank kept rates on hold last week, but left the door open for a September rate cut.\n\nMore earnings\n\nWhile most of the mega cap companies have already reported some high-profile earnings results are expected in the coming days.\n\nResults from industrial bellwether Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and media and entertainment giant Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) will give more insight into the health of manufacturing and the consumer. Also reporting are healthcare heavyweights, including weight-loss drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), which is at the center of the market's artificial intelligence excitement.\n\nU.S. stocks sold off for a second day on Friday, pushing the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory as indications that the economy is slowing stoked fears that the Fed has waited too long to cut rates.\n\nAdding to the downward pressure was a drop in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after quarterly results and disappointing forecasts.\n\nChina outlook\n\nInvestors will get an update on how the economic recovery in China is shaping up in the second half of the year with a slew of economic releases this week.\n\nThe week begins with a private-sector survey on services activity, followed by trade data on Wednesday and a reading on consumer prices at the end of the week.\n\nRecent data has pointed to a gloomy outlook for the world\u2019s number two economy, and recent surprise rate cuts have reflected a growing sense of urgency in Beijing's efforts to shore up growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOfficials will be keeping an especially close eye on Friday's inflation number for clues on how much more needs to be done to boost lackluster domestic demand.\n\nReserve Bank of Australia decision\n\nThe RBA is expected to keep interest rates on hold at its upcoming policy meeting on Tuesday after data last month showed that core inflation unexpectedly slowed to a two-year low in the second quarter and the rate of economic growth moderated in the first quarter.\n\nMarket participants will be focusing on the central banks forward guidance with markets pricing in a 70% probability of an easing in interest rates by the end of the year should inflation continue to slow.\n\nOil prices\n\nOil prices fell on Friday, settling at their lowest since January as weak economic data out of the U.S. and top oil importer China raised worries over the demand outlook.\n\nThe soft U.S. jobs report coupled with weakening manufacturing activity in China sent prices lower on the risk that a sluggish global economic recovery would weigh on oil consumption.\n\nOil investors are also watching the Middle East, where Lebanon's Iran-backed group Hezbollah said its conflict with Israel had entered a new phase.\n\nMeanwhile, an OPEC+ meeting last Thursday left the group's oil output policy unchanged, including a plan to start unwinding one layer of production cuts from October.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nBoE rate cut adds to sense of turnaround in sluggish UK economy\n\nFed's Barkin tells PBS program he won't prejudge what to do at next meeting\n\nView comments",

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "content": "It's hard to overstate the degree to which artificial intelligence (AI) has altered the technology landscape since early last year, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the ranks of the world's most valuable businesses.\n\nWhile the No. 1 position has changed hands several times over the past 12 months, it's currently occupied by Apple. The company's recent AI announcements have energized the Apple faithful, driving its market cap to $3.4 trillion.\n\nWith its full-court press into AI, Microsoft takes up the No. 2 spot at $3.1 trillion. Nvidia, with its industry-leading AI chip, has doubled over the past year to earn the No. 3 spot at $2.9 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with solid AI game plans of their own -- are also members of this exclusive fraternity, with market caps of $2.1 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively (as of market close on Wednesday).\n\nWith a market cap of just $41 billion, it might seem like an exaggeration to suggest that Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, might have a shot at joining the $1 trillion club. However, the strong, accelerating demand for servers designed to harness the power of AI -- and the company's years of experience in the field -- suggest Supermicro might have the qualities needed for membership. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGrowing like wildfire\n\nWhile Supermicro has only recently caught the attention of AI-centric investors, the company has been serving up custom-designed servers for more than three decades. This track record of experience served Supermicro well when those wanting to harness the power of generative AI came calling.\n\nThe company's claim to fame is its track record of developing power-miserly, rack-scale servers that boast a lower cost of ownership. Yet these cost-efficient systems are still able to provide the computational horsepower necessary to harness the power of AI and hyperscale data centers.\n\nFurthermore, Supermicro's building-block architecture ensures it can create a system to accommodate any budget or technology level. Finally, partnerships with the most important names in AI chips, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others, ensure a steady supply of the most in-demand processors.\n\nThis successful strategy has helped generate meteoric growth. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), revenue surged 200% year over year to $3.8 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $6.56 soared 329%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year revenue guidance to $14.9 billion, which would represent growth of 109%.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement said Supermicro grew 5 times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is gaining market share. Analysts at Northland came to the same conclusion, noting the company has increased its market share from 8% to 11%, with \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\n\nFinally, in a nod to Supermicro's importance within the broader market, the stock was added to the Nasdaq-100 Index on July 22.\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nSupermicro has the inside track when compared to its rivals. When demand for AI servers ratcheted up last year, the company was nimble enough to adjust on the fly. Its strong relationships with all the top AI chipmakers gave Supermicro a steady supply of the processors needed to outfit its high-end servers. That said, it will be some time before Supermicro achieves the title of trillionaire.\n\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is on track to deliver revenue of $14.9 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 2.75. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $363 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. Still, those days are a long way off, as Supermicro is scrambling to increase its production capacity to support sales of $25 billion.\n\nIf the company can keep up its triple-digit year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap as soon as 2029. However, even the bulls concede that maintaining growth of that magnitude is unlikely to happen. What's more likely is that the growth rate tapers off to a more manageable 50%, in which case Supermicro could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\n\nSome on Wall Street believe the demand for AI-capable servers will continue for years. Bank of America analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya calculates the market will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the next three years, maintaining that Supermicro's revenue could \"grow even faster.\"\n\nThis helps underscore the massive opportunity. If Supermicro captures just a small part of that windfall, the company will be a member of the $1 trillion club in short order.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Powerhouse Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Soar as Much as 115%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "One of the biggest drivers of the market rebound over the past year or so has been the rapid and ongoing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Recent developments have marked a giant leap forward in the technology, promising to automate a great number of mundane tasks, thereby increasing productivity and saving money.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, the AI rally has been taking a breather, with some of the most high-profile names in the space losing ground. That isn't surprising, given the relentless run that started early last year. The news isn't all bad. Most experts agree that we're still in the early stages of AI adoption, so the rally likely still has much further to climb, despite the recent retrenchment. This gives savvy investors the opportunity to invest in companies that still have room to run.\n\nHere are two AI-related stocks that with up to 111% additional upside, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir Technologies: Implied upside of 854%\n\nOne of the bottlenecks in generative AI adoption is the fact that many enterprises lack the expertise to implement the technology while still getting the most bang for their buck. Given the complexity of the systems at issue, that's not surprising. However, Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has bridged the gap between knowledge and execution.\n\nThe company has a long history of developing AI tools for the U.S. government and its allies and expanded its mandate to help businesses discover actionable intelligence from reams of corporate data. This expertise allowed Palantir to pivot quickly to develop generative AI tools that businesses could actually use. The fruit of these efforts is the company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which helps provide common sense solutions to everyday business problems.\n\nFurthermore, to address the resulting knowledge gap, management developed hands-on sessions, which it calls boot camps, that pair users with Palantir engineers to create solutions to company-specific problems. This unmet need has attracted companies in droves, with 1,300 bootcamps held since Palantir began hosting them late last year, with 500 over the past three months alone.\n\nThis is fueling robust results. In the first quarter, Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue jumped 40% year over year, even as the segment's customer count soared 69%. More importantly, the remaining deal value -- which provides insight into its future trajectory -- grew 74%, which suggests its growth will continue.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives is the most bullish among his Wall Street peers, suggesting Palantir stock will soar to $50 by 2025, representing upside potential of 85% compared to Monday's closing price. Ives believes these bootcamps will continue to attract converts, increasing Palantir's fortunes.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 227 times earnings and 27 times sales, Palantir seems frightfully expensive. However, its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which takes into account its accelerating growth, comes in at 0.3, when any number less than 1 suggests an undervalued stock.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside of 115%\n\nWhile Palantir helps companies harness the potential of AI, Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, creates high-end servers packed with the computational horsepower needed to bring AI to life.\n\nAs AI adoption has accelerated, many users are now looking to curb the massive energy consumption that is the result of AI processing, and Supermicro's focus on energy-efficient solutions is well-documented. Furthermore, the company boasts a building block architecture, which helps users create a system that best suits their needs. Supermicro offers a broad cross-section of free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air-cooling technology, ensuring there's a system that fits every budget.\n\nDuring Supermicro's fiscal 2024 third quarter, revenue surged 200% year over year to roughly $3.8 billion, while its diluted earnings per share soared 329% to $6.56. The company is scrambling to expand its production capabilities to meet the accelerating demand.\n\nSupermicro stock has soared a massive 750% since the dawn of 2023, but some believe there's much more upside ahead. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has a Street high price target of $1,500 and a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential upside of 115% compared to Monday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst is bullish on Supermicro's \"posture\" in the AI server industry and cites the company as a leader in terms of both complexity and scale. Perhaps more importantly, Baruah believes Supermicro can generate a revenue run rate of $40 billion to close out its fiscal 2026. For context, Supermicro delivered revenue of $7.1 billion in fiscal 2023 (ended June 30, 2023) and is on track to generate revenue of $14.5 billion for fiscal 2024. This suggests there's still plenty of upside ahead.\n\nThe analyst isn't alone in his bullish take. Of the 17 analysts who offered an opinion in June, 12 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nFinally, Supermicro stock is a bargain given the opportunity, currently selling for 1.4 times forward sales.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Super Micro Computer Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "content": "Over the past year, many Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nView our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Super Micro Computer\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Founder, Charles Liang, sold US$13m worth of shares at a price of US$252 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$702. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.9% of Charles Liang's holding.\n\nOver the last year we saw more insider selling of Super Micro Computer shares, than buying. They sold for an average price of about US$315. It's not particularly great to see insiders were selling shares at below recent prices. Since insiders sell for many reasons, we wouldn't put too much weight on it. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nI will like Super Micro Computer better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this freelist of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Super Micro Computer. Specifically, Lead Independent Director Tally Liu ditched US$420k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nDoes Super Micro Computer Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Super Micro Computer insiders own about US$5.9b worth of shares (which is 14% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Super Micro Computer Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nAn insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, Super Micro Computer makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. When we did our research, we found 2 warning signs for Super Micro Computer (1 is concerning!) that we believe deserve your full attention.\n\nOf course Super Micro Computer may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock rallied more than 12% on Wednesday following better-than-expected guidance from peer AMD (AMD) and a bullish call from analysts at Morgan Stanley after a more than 20% drop in the stock.\n\nAMD's quarterly results out late Tuesday quelled some concerns that the AI trade may have run its course as investors rotated out of Big Tech over the past month. The company beat expectations on the top and bottom lines and posted a better-than-expected outlook for the third quarter.\n\nAdditionally, tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) revealed higher spending on data center infrastructure in its latest quarterly results. AI chip suppliers like AMD and Nvidia stand to benefit from Big Tech's increased investments.\n\n\"The fear of some of this momentum not lasting, or maybe fear that the revenue trajectory wouldn't be there over the next 12 months or so \u2014 I think that is starting to ease,\" CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\n\nChip peers including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), ASML (ASML), and Super Micro (SMCI) were also rallying on Wednesday. Nvidia rallied nearly 13% on Wednesday as Big Tech continues to spend on AI data center infrastructure. Morgan Stanley's bullish call on the AI chip maker also sent shares higher.\n\nNvidia was also boosted on Wednesday by a note out from Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore, who moved the stock to a 'Top Pick' after a recent pullback from record highs reached in June.\n\nThe firm wrote the roughly 25% in Nvidia stock \"sell-off presents a good entry point as we continue to hear strong data points short term and long term, with overblown competitive concerns.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley cited five main drivers of the recent decline in Nvidia \u2014 spending plans, competition, export controls, supply chain fears, and valuation worries \u2014 but said, \"Through those concerns, the earnings environment is likely to remain strong, for Nvidia and for the whole AI complex.\"\n\nThe firm maintained its Overweight rating and $144 price target on the stock.\n\nNvidia stock is still up more than 135% this year, outpacing the Nasdaq's more modest 17% gain. The company is set to issue its next quarterly report on Wednesday, Aug. 28.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 High-Growth Stocks Poised to 2X by 2025",
        "content": "Stock markets have reached record highs at an unprecedented pace this year. However, gains have been concentrated among a small group of high-growth stocks. These few but big firms have grown significantly in the past six months, pushing the entire index higher. Analysts call this a \u201cnarrow\u201d market. For gains to be sustainable, the market must \u201cbroaden out\u201d over the remainder of this year and next. This implies that other stocks have the potential for triple-digit growth, which has made companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDIA) so successful.\r\n\r\nWhile tech has driven recent market performance, and artificial intelligence (AI) may spur further increases, a broadening market could see strong gains across a wide range of firms. Smaller players, such as data center infrastructure and energy providers, have benefited significantly from AI despite receiving less publicity than larger players. This pattern may repeat itself in other areas if an easing monetary policy stimulates broader market expansion.\r\n\r\nThe following section highlights three high-growth stocks well positioned to capitalize on potential widespread market increases, doubling over the next year or so.\u200b\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of high-growth stocks, Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) has brought athleisure to the mainstream. Although it is probably not the first company to come to mind in the current AI-driven environment, LULU stock has the potential for strong returns.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s share price has underperformed lately as inflation squeezed consumer budgets and competition rose, several factors could help reinvigorate growth. Inflation is stabilizing, wages are growing faster than prices and expected interest rate cuts may spur more consumer spending. This could benefit Lululemon\u2019s domestic sales. Internationally, sales jumped 40% on a constant exchange rate basis last year, thanks to a 25% increase in comparable sales. This means that the company does not need to rely solely on its home market \u2013 it is experiencing robust overseas growth, opening up a large potential market.\r\n\r\nThe 50% drop in Lululemon\u2019s share price this year has left it with a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20.5 times versus the 26.1 times the apparel sector average. More important, Lululemon\u2019s 16% profit margin vastly exceeds its competitors\u2019 6.2% average. The company demonstrates strong profit generation capabilities and is forecast to grow earnings at a comparable rate going forward.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalyst estimates give Lululemon stock an average $378.05 target price over the next year. However, some analysts point to Lululemon\u2019s track record of beating estimates and believe the stock could reach $525 per share in the next 12 months, representing nearly 40% upside.\u200b\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can\u2019t ignore a tech company experiencing strong demand in the current environment. This is especially relevant as Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a leading server manufacturer powering artificial intelligence and cloud services.\n\nAccording to Moody\u2019s, Super Micro\u2019s sales increased 200% over the last year as global data center capacity is estimated to double in the next five years. With unrelenting demand, the company\u2019s management believes it can continue gaining market share, as evidenced by rising guidance in its most recent earnings report.\r\n\r\nWhile not as well-known as Nvidia, Super Micro is no longer under the radar, with a P/E ratio of 36.9x, just below the average for the broader tech sector of 45.2x. However, factoring in analysts\u2019 expectations, the upside potential is compelling at 53% to the average price target of $1,025.58 per share. Additionally, surpassing $1,000 per share would make SMCA an attractive high-growth stock for a split, which often lifts share prices.\u200b\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The Duolingo (DUOL) logo on a smartphone screen with a map in the background.\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile the online language learning app Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUO) fits the definition of a tech stock, DUO stock is down almost 26% so far this year after surging 213% in 2023. However, this confirms Duolingo\u2019s potential as one of the high-growth stocks.\n\nThe company continues to grow in key metrics despite concerns that AI may make learning new languages obsolete. Monthly active users grew 35% over the prior year, with subscription bookings rising 47%. Additionally, free cash flow (FCF) more than doubled from the prior year.\r\n\r\nThis level of growth has attracted significant investor interest, as shown by Duolingo\u2019s high P/E ratio of 165.9x, indicating that analysts foresee continued profit growth. They predict the company\u2019s bottom line will jump 383% to $1.69 per share this year.\n\nThe average price target represents an almost 50% upside potential in the short to medium term based on expectations of substantially growing earnings through 2025. Duolingo reveals potential as a high-growth stock in the online education sector.\u200b\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Where Will Supermicro Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "Looking back on Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) five years ago, few likely envisioned it would reach the heights it has today. It has existed since 1993 and has traded as a stock since 2007. Despite building a large, successful business, the company was largely unknown outside its industry and drew little interest from stock investors.\n\nSupermicro's fortunes changed dramatically when its partnership with Nvidia brought about exponentially higher sales of AI-capable servers. This helped lead to the AI stock rising by over 3,500% over the last five years. Admittedly, another 3,500% increase in the next five years is unlikely, but the stock can probably generate market-beating returns during that time. Here's why.\n\nThe state of Supermicro\n\nThe most surprising things about Supermicro are its longtime obscurity and meteoric rise to prominence. The company describes itself as a \"rack-scale total IT solutions provider\" that creates environmentally friendly and energy-saving machinery.\n\nIt produces first-to-market hardware for the edge, 5G, data centers, the cloud, and AI in approximately 6 million square feet of manufacturing space. Moreover, it operates in more than 100 countries, meaning it built an extensive footprint despite receiving little attention from investors until recently.\n\nThe company's growth has now become too significant for investors to ignore. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), it reported $9.6 billion in revenue, a 95% yearly increase. With that, net income surged to $855 million compared with $446 million in the same year-ago period.\n\nWhere Supermicro is going\n\nAdditionally, its rapid growth is on track to continue. Markets.us estimates the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI server industry will exceed 30% through 2033.\n\nFortunately for Supermicro's shareholders, company estimates far exceed that rapidly growing industry CAGR. In the most recent earnings report, the company raised its fiscal 2024 revenue guidance to $14.7 billion, which would mean a 107% growth rate if revenue levels match the company estimate.\n\nAs for the stock, it has risen by almost 130% over the last year. Still, nearly all of that growth occurred in the first three months of the calendar year, and the stock has pulled back by more than 40% since peaking in March.\n\nHowever, that price correction could dramatically increase Supermicro's odds of outperforming the indexes. Its P/E ratio had reached 90 as its stock peaked. Now, with rising profits and falling stock prices, the earnings multiple has dropped to 39. Its PEG ratio of just 0.6 confirms that its P/E ratio is at a very low level, considering the rapid growth of its profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, analysts forecast that Supermicro's net income will grow by an average of 62% per year for the next five years. Admittedly, this is a \"way too early\" estimate and will likely change significantly as more information becomes known. Still, if profits grow at an average close to this estimate, it is likely the rapid growth of Supermicro stock will continue.\n\nSupermicro in five years\n\nAlthough a lot can happen in five years, Supermicro stands a high likelihood of beating the market over that time. As stated before, investors should not expect another 3,500% gain over five years, nor should they expect the company to maintain revenue growth near the triple-digits over the long run.\n\nNonetheless, the AI servers produced by Supermicro are experiencing unprecedented demand, leading to massive gains in the stock price. Moreover, even if estimates for the future change significantly, both Supermicro and its industry should experience rapid growth rates for years to come.\n\nAdditionally, considering the growth rates of the recent past, the 39 P/E ratio and the PEG ratio under 1 arguably make Supermicro a bargain stock. Given its recent pullback, now might be a good time to add shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Semiconductor companies and their customers are major contributors to the current market momentum. This means that finding and buying under-the-radar growth stocks in the semiconductor industry might provide high returns.\n\nOne example of this kind of investing is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), which experienced tremendous growth by capitalizing on the AI boom, developing AI-optimized servers, and introducing innovative liquid-cooled data centers. Strategic collaborations, such as building a large-scale AI data center in Asia optimized for Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI software, have further driven their significant revenue growth and market expansion\u200b.\n\nWith strong market positions, innovative product offerings, and geographic strategic expansions, these three companies are well-positioned to replicate Super Micro Computer\u2019s rapid growth. Each company addresses high-growth sectors in the AI, automotive, and areas of advanced semiconductor manufacturing that have paved their way toward success.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinally, these companies\u2019 fundamentals\u2014 such as revenue diversification, product innovation, and financial stability \u2014 provide signs to explain their untapped growth potential and expansion stability.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) leads in the development and manufacturing of advanced wafer processing technologies for semiconductors and related industries. ACMR had a high revenue increase of 105% annually, reaching $152.2 million in Q1 2024. This growth was derived primarily from the strong performance of single-wafer cleaning products, Tahoe, and semi-critical cleaning. These collectively grew by 199% to $109.5 million, and this segment now represents 72% of total revenue, reflecting its critical contribution to ACMR\u2019s financial standing and growth trajectory.\n\nMoreover, ACMR has strategically expanded its product portfolio, focusing on high-demand areas like single-wafer cleaning technologies. It captured a\u00a0considerable portion (25%\u201330%) of the total front-end cleaning market. The company attained a gross margin of 52.5%, surpassing its expected range of 40% to 45%. This margin strength reflects an operational edge and a favorable product mix. These elements contribute to uplifted profitability despite market fluctuations. Finally, the operating margin expanded considerably to 26.2% from 14.7% annually. This increase underscores ACMR\u2019s effective cost management and operational leverage as they scale their business and capitalize on growing market opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, ACMR\u2019s strong top-line growth and expanding product portfolio make it a high pick among the top under-the-radar growth stocks.\n\nHimax Technologies (HIMX) Shipping label of a box from Himax. HIMX stock.\n\nSource: Mamat Suryadi / Shutterstock\n\nHimax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) provides display imaging processing technologies. Despite a sequential revenue decline of 8.8% in Q1 2024, Himax exceeded its guidance range.\u00a0This\u00a0indicates a robust operational edge and possibly conservative forecasting. The company had attained a gross margin of 29.3%, breaching the guidance of around 28.5%, suggesting sharp cost management and a favorable product mix. The automotive segment contributed considerably to revenue, around 46% in Q1 2024, with expectations of growth driven by design-win projects and expanding adoption of technologies like TDDI and local dimming Tcon.\u00a0Hence, this\u00a0indicates Himax\u2019s lead and strong customer relationships in this booming market.\n\nAdditionally, Himax is a leader in fields such as AI sensing solutions (WiseEye), automotive TDDI, and display applications (tablet, laptop, and automobile).\u00a0This\u00a0demonstrates Himax\u2019s core capacity to expand its product offerings across industries with rapid development. The company\u2019s cash\u00a0position\u00a0is\u00a0$277.4 million as of Q1 2024, indicating a\u00a0robust financial\u00a0sheet, an increase from $223.8 million (Q1 2023). This liquidity supports both strategic goals and operational demands.\n\nTherefore, Himax\u00a0is one of the top under-the-radar growth stocks because it concentrates on high-growth industries.\n\nMagnachip Semiconductor (MX) a close up image of a semiconductor. 5X Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMagnachip Semiconductor (NYSE:MX) designs and manufactures analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products. In Q1 2024, Magnachip had a top line of $49.1 million.\u00a0This\u00a0was within the guidance range and demonstrated sequential growth in their standard product business by 10.6%. This growth indicates improving market conditions and a potential end to inventory corrections in\u00a0certain\u00a0verticals.\n\n2Specifically,\u00a0in\u00a0Magnachip\u2019s standard product business, Mobile Display Solutions (MSS), revenue was $9.0 million, up 5.2% sequentially. This growth\u00a0was driven\u00a0by increased demand for automotive LCD and OLED products. Similarly, Power and Analog Solutions (PAS) revenue was $36.5 million, up 12% sequentially, driven\u00a0by demand in industrial e-motor markets, consumer appliances, and server power.\n\nFurther, Magnachip\u2019s consolidated gross profit margin was 18.3%, within the guided range of 17% to 20%.\u00a0This\u00a0is primarily due to lower Gumi fab utilization from the wind-down of Transitional Foundry Services. The MSS gross profit margin improved considerably to\u00a044.6% in Q1 2024.\u00a0This\u00a0is led\u00a0by non-recurring engineering revenue and higher-than-expected revenue from first-generation Display Driver ICs.\n\nTo conclude, Magnachip\u2019s strategic focus on high-growth sectors and expanded margins point to its potential among under-the-radar growth stocks.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in ACMR.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this server technology company have returned -14.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, which Super Micro falls in, has lost 10.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSuper Micro is expected to post earnings of $8.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +130.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +101.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $34.31 indicates a change of +44.1% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Super Micro is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for SMCI _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.3 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +142.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.93 billion and $23.92 billion estimates indicate +109.7% and +60.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +200%. EPS of $6.65 for the same period compares with $1.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.89%. The EPS surprise was +15.05%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "SMCI Stock Analysis: The Bull Run Is Not Over for Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is on a growth\u00a0trajectory. The company is largely expanding its manufacturing capabilities, adding three new facilities in Silicon Valley and worldwide. This expansion supports the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and liquid-cooled solutions, leading\u00a0to a recommendation for a buy rating for Super Micro Computer stock.\u00a0Its strategic moves and financial standing indicate sharp growth ahead.\n\nSuper Micro\u2019s new facilities may double its current AI SuperCluster capacity, addressing the rising demand for AI-focused workloads. Liquid-cooled data centers are becoming essential. They offer more performance per watt and lower operational costs, positioning Super Micro as an AI and data center market leader. Super Micro\u2019s financials further support a bullish outlook. The company had a considerable increase in net sales and net income. Its gross margins and EPS also saw high growth, supporting its expansion efforts, valuation growth, and the buy rating for Super Micro Computer stock.\n\nThe Impact of Super Micro\u2019s Expansion Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro\u2019s new manufacturing facilities are a moat. They achieve this by addressing the rising demand for AI and liquid-cooled solutions. This is relevant because AI workloads are incredibly calculation intensive, meaning they require processor-efficient and powerful data centers to run. To address this demand, Super Micro\u2019s new facilities focus on delivering complete liquid-cooled solutions, including systems, racks, and water towers. These solutions reduce electricity consumption and operational costs and minimize the environmental impact of data centers by allowing the processing units to run at higher speeds without temperature impeding them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, the expanded manufacturing footprint boosts Super Micro\u2019s worldwide delivery capabilities. The new facilities may sharply reduce delivery times to clients. This improved production edge solidifies Super Micro\u2019s market position as its expansion is strategically timed to demand.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Stock (NASDAQ:SMCI): Very Undervalued with a 0.62x PEG Ratio",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI), which specializes in high-performance computing and server solutions, is among the many victims of the tech sell-off. However, with the stock falling, the company\u2019s valuation metrics are starting to look even more attractive, with the price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio falling to 0.62x (1.0x or less is generally considered to be undervalued), inferring that the stock is deeply discounted.\n\nDespite the rotation out of tech stock, the supportive trends in artificial intelligence (AI) are set to be sustained. That\u2019s why I\u2019m bullish on this AI enabler.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s Expanding Market\n\nThe global AI infrastructure market is set to be one of the fastest-growing sectors in the coming years, and there\u2019s a host of research and forecasts to support this. See below:\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global AI infrastructure market will surge from $35.42 billion in 2023 to $227 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.4%. A report by ClearML and the AI Research Alliance forecasts the market to reach $309.4 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 29.8% from $23.5 billion in 2021. Precedence Research estimates the market will grow to $421.44 billion by 2033, at a CAGR of 27.53%. Statista data suggests that the broader AI market surpassed $184 billion in 2024 and is expected to exceed $826 billion by 2030.\n\nThe rapid growth is driven by several factors, including increased adoption of AI technologies across industries, advancements in machine learning and deep learning, and the rising demand for cloud-based AI services. The hardware segment, particularly specialized chips and processors for complex AI computations, is expected to play a crucial role in this expansion.\n\nHow Does Super Micro Fit In?\n\nSuper Micro plays a crucial role in the AI industry by providing high-performance, energy-efficient server solutions tailored for AI workloads. The company has strategically positioned itself as a leader in AI infrastructure, leveraging its strong partnerships with key players like Nvidia (NVDA) to deliver cutting-edge technology faster than many competitors. It\u2019s very much an innovation-focused firm with a first-to-market strategy.\n\nSuper Micro\u2019s offerings include AI-optimized servers equipped with powerful GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and specialized AI accelerators, which are essential for handling the complex computations required by AI applications. This focus on AI has resulted in more than 50% of Super Micro\u2019s revenue now being AI-related.\n\nOne of the company\u2019s strongest offerings is its liquid cooling technology. This allows servers to handle the intense heat generated by high-performance AI workloads more efficiently than traditional air cooling. The liquid cooling solutions can reduce electricity costs for cooling infrastructure by up to 92% and overall data center electricity costs by up to 51%. It also means servers can work at optimum temperatures.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Is Super Micro Stock Down?\n\nSuper Micro stock is actually down more than $530 per share since peaking in March \u2014 that\u2019s a 43% decline. Essentially, the market is unsure just how big this AI tailwind is, and the steady decline in April has been exacerbated by a rotation away from technology stocks in July.\n\nOne significant trigger for the rotation was the disappointing earnings reports from major tech companies like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA), which caused a ripple effect across the sector. These results led to a broader market correction as investors reassessed the high valuations that tech stocks had reached amid the AI boom\n\nRegarding Super Micro specifically, the lack of preliminary results for its fiscal third quarter was a major catalyst for its stock\u2019s decline. The company\u2019s Q4 results are due on August 6, and to date, there have been no preliminary results. Since the AI boom started almost 24 months ago, Super Micro has provided early insights into its financial performance \u2014 and they\u2019ve been positive \u2014 and the absence of such information may be contributing to the sell-off.\n\nSuper Micro\u2019s Unmissable Valuation\n\nSuper Micro\u2019s valuation metrics have become more attractive as the share price has come down. For context, there have been no downward revisions of expected earnings in the last 90 days, and there have been 12 upward revisions during that period.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at 29 times forward earnings. That\u2019s obviously more than we\u2019d expect to pay for your average S&P 500 (SPX) stock, but not by much. However, the company\u2019s expected earnings growth is significant, and this takes the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio down to 20.5x for 2025 and 16.4x for 2026.\n\nMoreover, analysts are forecasting an annualized growth rate of 47.9% over the medium term. In turn, this leads to a PEG ratio of just 0.62x. This infers that the stock is deeply undervalued.\n\nIs Super Micro Stock a Buy, According To Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, SMCI comes in as a Moderate Buy based on five Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Super Micro Computer stock price target is $978.50, implying 40.6% upside potential.\n\nSee more SMCI analyst ratings\n\nThe Bottom Line on Super Micro Computer Stock\n\nThe average share price target for SMCI stock, coupled with the PEG ratio, infers that the sell-off has been too severe. With supportive long-term trends in the sector and a track record for innovation, I\u2019m bullish on Super Micro Computer and expect to see the stock recover in the coming quarters.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Buy Super Micro Computer Before Aug. 6?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has helped a more than 30-year-old company soar to center stage in recent times. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) steadily grew its earnings over the years thanks to sales of equipment like servers and workstations. But sales and profitability truly took off over the past few years thanks to demand from customers building out AI platforms -- and this has helped the stock price take off too. Super Micro shares have advanced more than 3,500% over the past five years.\n\nAnalysts forecast major growth for the AI market throughout the decade, and if they're right, this top equipment company is set to benefit. In the most recent earnings report, Super Micro reported record demand for its full rack scale solutions. All of this offers us reason to be optimistic about what the company will say during the next report, scheduled for Aug. 6.\n\nAt the same time, if Super Micro disappoints in any way, this could weigh on the shares, which already have slipped 40% from their high earlier this year. Considering all of this, should you buy Super Micro shares before Aug. 6 -- or wait? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe secret to Super Micro's success\n\nFirst, a bit about why Super Micro has been so successful over the past few years. Customers building out AI platforms require certain equipment like servers and full rack scale solutions. Super Micro and others sell this sort of equipment, but Super Micro has managed to deliver a growth rate that's five times faster than the industry average over the past 12 months. This is due to the company's ability to quickly customize products according to the needs of its customers.\n\nSuper Micro does this thanks to its \"building blocks\" method -- its products share many common parts so it's quick and easy to assemble and customize them. Also, the company works closely with top chip designers like Nvidia, following their product development timetables -- this way, when a new chip is available, Super Micro can immediately integrate it into its equipment.\n\nThe company also aims to keep its costs down and productivity up and has recently opened a new facility in Malaysia that will support the effort.\n\nAll of this helped Super Micro report triple-digit increases in sales and net income in the most recent quarter. And, as mentioned, this trend could continue thanks to the general growth in the AI market and the fact that Super Micro has been reporting record demand for its products.\n\nWhat to expect on Aug. 6\n\nOn Aug. 6, Super Micro will report fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings. The stock could advance after the report if the company beats analysts' estimates or announces a stock split -- since the shares trade for around $700, investors have speculated the company would join other stock market giants that have recently split their stocks after reaching high levels. A stock split lowers the per-share price, making the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors -- but it doesn't change the market value or valuation of the particular company.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Nvidia and Broadcom completed such operations a few weeks ago. I predicted in an earlier story that Super Micro soon would make the move, and I still think it's a strong possibility. That said, if Super Micro reports earnings growth, but it doesn't meet expectations and the company doesn't announce a split, the stock may suffer after the upcoming report.\n\nA long-term view\n\nSo, what should you do? Is Super Micro a buy before its next earnings report, or should you wait to make a move? It probably doesn't matter, and here's why. Super Micro's potential gains or losses in the trading session following its earnings report won't impact your long-term returns by much. So, as a long-term investor, you don't have to worry about buying a stock at its very lowest point or on a particular dip. Instead, focus on valuation, and if it looks good and you're confident about the company's long-term prospects, the stock is worth adding to your portfolio.\n\nToday, Super Micro trades for 20 times forward earnings estimates -- dirt cheap considering the company's growth so far and the likelihood of more to come. I wouldn't expect the stock to shift from a bargain valuation to an out-of-sight one in just a couple of weeks. So, whether you scoop the stock up right now or after the Aug. 6 earnings report, you may score a win over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Taiwan\u2019s Premier Cho Jung-tai has announced a sweeping economic and social reform plan, aiming to attract nearly $100 billion in investments. This comes after former President Donald Trump said \u201cTaiwan should pay us for defense.\u201d\n\nWhat Happened: The reform plan would focus on energy, artificial intelligence, and infrastructure. The strategy includes appealing to Taiwanese investors disillusioned with conducting business in China, a trend the government aims to capitalize on, said Premier Cho in an interview with Nikkei Asia.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nHere\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share. Don\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nThe plan is in line with President Lai Ching-te\u2018s vision of a \u201csmarter, forward-looking sustainability,\u201d exploring ocean and space industries, and enhancing Taiwan\u2019s global presence.\n\nDespite the opposition\u2019s majority in parliament, Cho is determined to push forward with the reform, which aims to revitalize the Democratic Progressive Party following Lai\u2019s re-election in January.\n\nThe plan includes the establishment of an Economic Development Commission, chaired by Cho, to oversee a $100 billion investment in development.\n\nCho also emphasized the need to address concerns over livelihoods and housing and to attract Taiwanese investors who have turned away from China\u2019s business environment. He stated, \u201cChina is no longer an attractive investment environment from a legal or political point of view. Many Taiwanese companies are coming back to Taiwan.\u201d\n\nSee Also:Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nAnother top priority for Cho is energy security. From 2023 to 2026, many existing power plants are scheduled to shut down, making it a critical period.\n\nNext year, the last reactor at Taiwan\u2019s Third Nuclear Power Plant is scheduled for retirement. However, Cho indicated that a proposal to extend nuclear service should have been made five years ago. While the government is open to exploring future atomic energy systems, he emphasized that \u201ctomorrow\u2019s technologies won\u2019t help our power demand today.\u201d\n\nThe urgency has intensified as NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), the world\u2019s leading AI chip developer, along with contract manufacturer and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) biggest iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group and server maker Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI), announced plans to build new supercomputer or AI data centers in Taiwan.

This underscores the volatility and sensitivity of Taiwan\u2019s market to international political events. Former President Donald Trump\u2018s recent comments suggesting Taiwan should pay for its defense have raised concerns about the future of U.S. support.\n\nMoreover, the rapid growth of AI technologies is putting pressure on Taiwan\u2019s infrastructure. Chief Telecom\u2018s President Jacky Liu has called for a complete redesign of data centers to meet the demands of AI computing, highlighting the urgent need for infrastructure upgrades.\n\nPresident Lai Ching-te has also publicly thanked Micron Technology Inc.\u2018s (NASDAQ:MU) CEO for ongoing investments in Taiwan, emphasizing the importance of foreign investment in sustaining Taiwan\u2019s technological edge.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhen today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out.

        "content": "Wall Street rarely sees two trends like artificial intelligence (AI) and stock-split euphoria competing for attention. AI drove record highs for major indices in 2024, while stock splits, though cosmetic, also fueled market excitement for certain names.\n\nStock splits come in forward or reverse types, with forward splits being more popular among investors. Forward splits lower share prices to attract investors, while reverse splits raise prices to meet exchange standards. In 2024, high-profile companies, such as the following, drew significant attention with their splits.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into some of these splits, what they mean for investors, and whether future splits could be in order for these top tech names.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors continue to anticipate gains from Broadcom\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) recent 10-for-1 split. A Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysis shows stocks typically rise 25.4% within a year of a split, versus 11.9% for the S&P 500. On that mathematical basis alone, there\u2019s a thesis behind buying this stock right now.\n\nCiti (NYSE:C) analysts recently noted Broadcom\u2019s rising momentum, citing growing investor interest due to its expanding AI clientele and VMware acquisition. While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) clearly remains the favored player in this sector, investor fatigue with other mega-cap chip names appears to be boosting Broadcom\u2019s appeal.\n\nAt the time of writing, AVGO stock trades just above $150 per share, with a market cap of $705 billion. Market analysts continue to praise Broadcom for its leadership in the semiconductor industry and infrastructure software and commended its strategic product portfolio. So, could AVGO be among the next stocks to hit a $1 trillion valuation, given it\u2019s within a 50% move of hitting this target.\n\nCurrently well-positioned for more growth, AVGO stock is seeing strong growth courtesy of its AI and cloud computing exposure. The company\u2019s strong R&D investments and recurring revenue from infrastructure software support a solid business model. Additionally, Broadcom\u2019s recent VMware acquisition is expected to boost growth by integrating key AI tools. Broadcom\u2019s strategy to lead in critical markets with high switching costs supports a positive long-term investment outlook.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is another key beneficiary of the recent AI boom. Once a niche player, its liquid-cooling technology now supports 30% of data center operations. Recently, SMCI achieved $3 billion in quarterly revenue, higher than its 2021 annual total, reflecting record demand for its solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts predict the AI market will surge from $200 billion to over $1 trillion by 2030, boosting Super Micro Computer\u2019s prospects. Unlike Nvidia, which relies on new product releases for revenue, SMCI benefits by integrating new chips from major manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) into its products. This path has driven the firm\u2019s growth to five times the industry average. As AI advances and new chips launch, Super, Micro Computer\u2019s diversified strategy positions it for continued success, independent of any single chipmaker\u2019s performance.\n\nBenefiting from AI growth, Super Micro Computer may offer better long-term returns than Nvidia. With a forward price-earnings ratio of 24-times versus Nvidia\u2019s 43-times, it\u2019s a promising, undervalued AI investment.\n\nPalo Alto Network (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a top cybersecurity stock which has surged 350% in the past 5 years. The company\u2019s Q1 results were impressive, with earnings per share coming in at $1.32 and revenue reaching $1.98 billion. As interest rates decline, the company anticipates increased cybersecurity spending.\n\nDriven Technologies earned Palo Alto Networks\u2019 NextWave Diamond Innovator status, joining a select group of top channel partners. This recognition highlights Driven Technologies\u2019 extensive cybersecurity solutions, including AI-managed services. Its Chief Executive Officer Rudy Casasola emphasized that this status affirms their team\u2019s industry-leading expertise and use of Palo Alto Networks\u2019 advanced tools.\n\nIn the cybersecurity sector and a market full of start-ups, Palo Alto Network has made a notable shift in consolidating the sector with tight competition. PANW CEO Nikesh Aurora notes that since he took over in 2018, the company has emerged as a platform that offers integrated solutions for a more secure access service edge. Thus, for those bullish on the cybersecurity space, this remains a top pick worth considering on dips moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Super Micro Computer a Better AI Stock to Buy Right Now Than Nvidia?",
        "content": "What's the best-performing large-cap artificial intelligence (AI) stock on the market so far in 2024? I suspect many investors would quickly answer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). But they'd be wrong.\n\nYes, Nvidia has delivered sizzling gains this year despite its recent pullback. However, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly referred to as Supermicro, has been an even bigger winner. Is Supermicro a better AI stock to buy right now than Nvidia?\n\nIt largely boils down to one factor\n\nWhenever I'm asked to choose which of two stocks is the better pick, I have a standard answer: It depends on your investing style. That's usually the right answer, by the way.\n\nIf you're retired and looking for steady income, a stock that pays a reliable dividend is probably a better choice for you than a growth stock with no dividend at all. On the other hand, it's a different story altogether if you're an aggressive investor looking for growth.\n\nTechnically, Nvidia is a better pick for income investors than Supermicro because it offers a dividend and Supermicro doesn't. However, with Nvidia's practically microscopic forward dividend yield of 0.035%, I doubt income investors will like either of these AI stocks.\n\nSimilarly, I don't think value investors will find either Supermicro or Nvidia appealing. Both stocks trade at forward earnings multiples well above the threshold that would attract the interest of most value investors.\n\nWith Supermicro and Nvidia, I think the decision largely boils down to one key factor: growth. Investors trying to choose between the two stocks must determine which has stronger growth prospects.\n\nHow Wall Street views Supermicro and Nvidia\n\nIf you want a quick-and-dirty answer to that question, simply look at Wall Street forecasts. Analysts project that Supermicro will generate average annual earnings growth of around 62% over the next five years. That's well above the average annual earnings growth of 46% expected for Nvidia.\n\nBut does Wall Street view Supermicro as the better stock to buy? Some analysts do, but not all of them.\n\nOf the six analysts surveyed by LSEG in July who cover Supermicro, two rated the stock as a buy with the other four rating it as a hold. The overall numbers looked better for Nvidia. Twenty-one of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG in July rated the stock as a buy or strong buy. All but two of the others recommended holding Nvidia.\n\nRealistic growth estimates\n\nShould investors rely solely on Wall Street projections and ratings to choose between Supermicro and Nvidia? No. It's important to do your own research before making a decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think the bullish growth prospects for both Supermicro and Nvidia are realistic. The demand for AI will almost certainly continue to fuel explosive growth for Supermicro's servers and storage systems and Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThese two companies also have strong competitive advantages over their rivals. Perhaps the most important edge Supermicro and Nvidia both claim is their rapid pace of innovation. Supermicro's revenue is growing five times faster than the industry average in large part because it's able to introduce new products so quickly. Similarly, Nvidia is now in what CEO Jensen Huang calls \"a one-year rhythm\" in rolling out new GPU platforms.\n\nBetter AI stock?\n\nSo is Supermicro a better AI stock to buy right now than Nvidia? I think it is -- for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, valuation does come into play. Supermicro has less growth baked into its share price than Nvidia does.\n\nSecond, Supermicro uses Nvidia's chips but also partners with AMD and Intel. Even if Nvidia loses market share to these rivals, Supermicro's growth shouldn't be negatively impacted.\n\nI could be proven wrong. So could Wall Street. However, if I had to pick just one of these two AI stocks right now, I'd go with Supermicro.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Stock splits continue to be one of the major themes in the market this year. Shoemaker Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) just announced a six-for-one stock split that will take effect on Sept. 9 this year. It follows a 10-for-1 stock split by microchip developer Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) on July 15 that lowered its share price to $170 a share from $1,700.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why stock splits are popular. While they don\u2019t change the valuation or fundamentals of a stock, they make them a lot more affordable for investors to purchase shares, particularly individual retail investors. In recent months, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) have each split their stocks to make them more attractive and palatable to investors.\n\nHere is the stock split spotlight: The next three names are potential stock splits that could follow Nvidia\u2019s lead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market\u2019s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco Wholesale\u2019s (NASDAQ:COST) stock has quietly gotten expensive. Having risen 44% over the last 12 months, Costco\u2019s share price is now sitting at $815 a share. Not only has the share price gotten steep, but the stock\u2019s valuation is also high right now, trading at 46 times future earnings estimates. That\u2019s about double the average price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25 among stocks listed in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nWhile a stock split won\u2019t fix the valuation of COST stock, it could certainly help bring the share price back down within reach of most investors. Stock splits are not new to Costco. The company has undergone two splits in the past. However, it\u2019s been 24 years since the last split occurred in January 2000. The length of time might give management further reason to split the stock and bring the share price lower.\n\nCostco Wholesale remains a long-term winner for investors, with the stock having risen nearly 200% in the last five years.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile market forces have brought its share price lower in recent weeks, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock is still pricey, trading at nearly $700. That\u2019s more than double the $285 per share that the stock was at on the first trading day of the year in January. The meteoric rise of SMCI stock has also pushed its valuation up to a lofty P/E ratio of 39, meaning the stock has gotten expensive.\n\nThe good news is that Super Micro Computer\u2019s share price has come down 43% from its 52-week high of $1,229 reached in March of this year. That said, a stock split would help to make SMCI stock more attractive, especially to mom-and-pop investors. Nvidia split its stock in June when it was not much higher than where Super Micro Computer stock is now. Demand for Super Micro Computer\u2019s servers that run AI models and the company\u2019s share price are expected to keep rising, making an eventual stock split look inevitable.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear-to-date, Super Micro Computer stock has risen 148%.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) just popped nearly 15% after the software company reported strong financial results for the year\u2019s second quarter, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) demand. The success has lifted ServiceNow\u2019s stock up by 44% in the last 12 months and is now trading near a 52-week high of $850. The stock\u2019s valuation is sky-high at about 90 times future earnings estimates.\n\nServiceNow\u2019s stock has risen nearly 3,000% since its 2012 initial public offering (IPO). And the stock has never split. That might change with the share price approaching $1,000. As with Super Micro Computer, ServiceNow continues to be a main beneficiary of the AI trade. That doesn\u2019t look likely to change anytime soon as the company\u2019s just-released earnings reinforce the company\u2019s role within the AI sector.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in DECK and NVDA.

        "title": "Institutional investors in Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) see US$6.2b decrease in market cap last week, although long-term gains have benefitted them.",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Super Micro Computer implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 16 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have sold recently\n\nA look at the shareholders of Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 59% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nInstitutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$6.2b last week. However, the 113% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Super Micro Computer, beginning with the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Super Micro Computer?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Super Micro Computer, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Super Micro Computer. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are BlackRock, Inc. and Charles Liang, with an equal amount of shares to their name at 9.2%. Charles Liang, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chairman of the Board.\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 16 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Super Micro Computer\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Super Micro Computer, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$42b, and insiders have US$5.9b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Super Micro Computer has  3 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Is Plummeting This Week",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock is sinking in this week's trading. The high-performance server specialist's share price was down 12.7% from last week's close heading into this Friday's market opening, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nTech stocks continued to pull back this week as investors assessed risks related to geopolitical dynamics between the U.S., China, and Taiwan. Sell-offs intensified after Alphabet and Tesla published second-quarter reports that worried Wall Street. (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nWhile there wasn't any business-specific news dragging Supermicro lower, the company's valuation is getting hit in a pullback that's impacting the broader market and having a particularly pronounced impact on otherwise high-flying artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. The timing of the server specialist's addition to the Nasdaq-100 index also didn't help the stock this week.\n\nBearish ripple effects from earnings season hit Supermicro\n\nIn addition to geopolitical risk factors continuing to pressure growth stocks, earnings season has gotten off to a shaky start for the technology sector. Alphabet and Tesla reported Q2 earnings after the market closed on Tuesday, becoming the first of the highly influential \"Magnificent Seven\" companies to publish updated financial results. Unfortunately, Wall Street considered both reports to be duds -- and the disappointment created ripple effects that extended to Supermicro and other AI stocks.\n\nAlphabet posted per-share earnings of $1.89 on revenue of $84.74 billion, which actually came in better than the average Wall Street target's call for per-share earnings of $$1.85 on sales of $84.29 billion. But the company guided for higher costs and weaker operating income margins in Q3, and investors adopted a more bearish stance in response.\n\nTesla's quarterly report was significantly more concerning. While Q2 revenue of $25.5 billion topped the average analyst estimate by $760 million, non-GAAP (adjusted) per-share earnings of $0.52 fell short of the market's target by $0.10 per share. Comments from management about the business's near-term outlook and spending plans also worried investors.\n\nJoining the Nasdaq-100 index didn't boost Supermicro stock this week\n\nSuper Micro Computer was added to the Nasdaq-100 on July 22, and the timing of the addition may also be playing a role in this week's sell-offs. While being added to major indexes is often a bullish catalyst because it causes exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to buy the stock, it's actually a negative catalyst when the underlying index level and corresponding ETF prices are dropping. For reference, the Nasdaq-100 index has fallen roughly 4.5% over the last week of trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors who are eager for the next major, business-specific updates that could Supermicro's stock price won't have to wait long. The company is scheduled to report quarterly results after the market closes on Aug. 6.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "SMCI Alert: Why it\u2019s Time to Buy Super Micro Computer Stock",
        "content": "Major tech stocks, including Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), are tumbling again. As of this writing, Super Micro Computer stock has fallen below $700 per share, hitting levels not hit since back in February.\n\nThe length and extent of this market volatility are unclear. Don\u2019t assume recent price action means the end for Super Micro. Early next month, shares may experience a strong price recovery.\n\nMoreover, in 2025, as this early-mover in the AI server space continues to capitalize on surging demand, there may be potential for this 2024 winner to deliver another year of above-average returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHence, instead of heading for the hills in light of the \u201cSupermicro slide,\u201d you may want to pounce on it instead.\n\nWhy Supermicro and Other AI Heavyweights are Tanking\n\nAgain, the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the latest round of price declines for SMCI largely has to do with broad market sentiment.\n\nThis week, concerns about the sustainability of the AI growth trend have heightened once again. Bullishness about the much-anticipated \u201cFed pivot\u201d has fallen as well.\n\nTaking this into account, it\u2019s clear why it\u2019s not just Super Micro Computer stock, but other AI heavyweights as well, that are tumbling down to lower prices.\n\nThat said, while one can consider shifting sentiment on AI stocks as an indirect factor, admittedly it does tie in directly with the SMCI bull case.\n\nIf not just \u201cAI mania\u201d among stock market speculators, but \u201cAI mania\u201d in Silicon Valley as well, cools down, that would likely mean a walking-back of Big Tech\u2019s artificial intelligence build-out plans.\n\nThis, in turn, would mean lower demand for AI hardware, including for this company\u2019s high performance server products.\n\nStill, just because the market is feeling fear, uncertainty, and doubt again about the generative AI growth trend, doesn\u2019t mean a sharp slowdown is happening.\n\nIn the coming weeks, there\u2019s something that could minimize such concerns. That would be the upcoming quarterly earnings release from Big Tech firms.\n\nA Possible Fast Track to a Recovery\n\nSome of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks have already reported results for the preceding quarter. However, quite a few are scheduled to do so next week. These include some of the largest \u201cbig spenders\u201d on GenAI infrastructure.\n\nStrong results and better-than-expected guidance may drive these stocks higher after earnings, while management commentary on AI spending plans could indirectly boost Super Micro Computer stock.\n\nBetter yet, possible indirect boosts for SMCI could pale in comparison to the market\u2019s reaction, when this company itself releases quarterly results post-market on Aug. 6.\n\nStory continues\n\nYes, Supermicro decided once again not to report preliminary results. As we mentioned recently, an earnings preannouncement was a potential catalyst for shares.\n\nStill, as InvestorPlace\u2019s Thomas Niel recently noted, just because the company didn\u2019t pre-announce, doesn\u2019t mean Super Micro Computer is sitting on bad news.\n\nFurthermore, following the slide and lack of preliminary numbers, it\u2019s possible that the market has already walked-back its expectations.\n\nThere may now be the stronger possibility of better-than-expected results.\n\nIf Supermicro reports another quarterly slowdown in sales growth, and merely reiterates full fiscal year guidance, it may just well be enough to spark a relief rally.\n\nThe Verdict: Feel Free to Buy if Weakness Continues\n\nIn the coming days, the \u201cSupermicro sell-off\u201d could continue. However, don\u2019t let today\u2019s volatility scare you off from entering or adding to a position. Feel free to buy, if weakness continues.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Beyond the potential for a sooner-than-expected relief rally, there may be a path for shares to re-hit past four-digit price levels between now and the end of 2025.\n\nRight now, after the pullback, SMCI has fallen to a valuation of around 30 times earnings.\n\nIn the next fiscal year, which ends in June 2025, if the AI infrastructure boom continues, this company may be on its way to reporting earnings in line with current forecasts.\n\nAnalyst consensus calls for Supermicro to report earnings of $34.06 per share in FY2025. Even if Super Micro Computer just maintains its current multiple, this may be enough to send it back to $1000 per share.\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in PLTR.

        "content": "Investors should take full advantage of the current downturn in Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) and buy the stock. Super Micro Computer stock is going through a rough patch right now due to ongoing market volatility and a move away from highflying tech concerns.\n\nSince July 18, SMCI stock has fallen 15%. The decline is due to sector rotation, not fundamental issues with Super Micro Computer. Investors should buy-the-dip in this leading AI play without hesitation.\n\nBullish Outlook\n\nEven with the current pullback, Super Micro Computer stock has had an incredible run this year. Since January, SMCI stock has gained 150%. The stock continues to be the best performer in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts see plenty of upside ahead. The median price target on Super Micro Computer stock is nearly 40% higher than where the shares presently trade.\n\nThe stock\u2019s surge is fueled by strong growth driven by demand for Super Micro Computer\u2019s high-efficiency servers used for AI. In its May earnings report, Super Micro Computer reported that its revenue rose 200% year over year.\n\nThe company\u2019s guidance for this year implies revenue growth of 582% at the midpoint. Super Micro Computer is scheduled to report earnings next on Aug. 6 and analysts are bracing for another blockbuster print.\n\nNasdaq 100 Inclusion\n\nIt might seem surprising, but 18 months ago Super Micro Computer was a small-cap stock trading on the Russell 2000 index.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth has been so meteoric that earlier this year, its stock joined the S&P 500 for the first time, immediately becoming the index\u2019s best performer.\n\nMore recently, SMCI stock was added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA).\n\nSuper Micro Computer began trading on the Nasdaq 100 on July 22. The Nasdaq 100 is comprised of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 is good news as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track the index are required to buy its shares.\n\nThe index additions come as Super Micro Computers\u2019 market capitalization, which currently stands at $41.67 billion, has gotten too big to ignore.\n\nBuy Super Micro Computer Stock\n\nWhile shares of Super Micro Computer are dropping amid a broader market pullback, the current decline is not due to issues within the company.\n\nOn a fundamental basis, SMCI stock remains intact. The story surrounding the company also continues to hold up as demand for its servers that run AI remains white hot.\n\nStory continues\n\nUpcoming earnings will be a test. If the company passes that test, its share price can be counted on to soar once again. For this reason, investors should buy-the-dip in Super Micro Computer stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meet the New Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500 Artificial Intelligence Stock That Topped Nvidia in the First Half",
        "content": "The stock market soared in the first half, but the movement wasn't exactly broad-based. A certain type of company led the S&P 500 to its increase of more than 14%.\n\nI'm talking about technology players, especially those with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, just four of these stocks -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon -- accounted for more than half of the index's first-half gain, according to JP Morgan Wealth Management. Among those four, Nvidia registered the best performance by far, soaring nearly 150%.\n\nBut another AI stock actually topped the AI chip giant in the period, advancing 188%. Thanks to this company's rising earnings and excellent performance, it recently was invited to join the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100.\n\nIt entered the S&P 500 in March and the Nasdaq 100 index this month. Let's meet this new index member that topped Nvidia in the first half, and find out whether it could do the same in the second half. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nJoining the S&P 500\n\nFirst, it's important to note that joining these indexes is a big deal as they include companies that power today's economy. The S&P 500 tracks the performance of the 500 largest listed companies, while the Nasdaq 100 includes the biggest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq. If a company is invited to join these indexes, it suggests it's done well -- and should continue to play a key role in growth moving forward.\n\nWhat stock am I talking about? Top performer Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), an equipment maker that sells servers, workstations, and full rack scale solutions needed in AI data centers.\n\nDemand for Supermicro's equipment has soared in recent years as companies launch AI projects and build out their platforms. Just to illustrate how far Supermicro has come, we should take a look at quarterly earnings. A few months ago, the company reported its first $3 billion quarter -- as recently as 2021, this was the revenue level for an entire year.\n\nThis revenue momentum isn't likely to stop as it's the early days of the AI boom, and Supermicro has what it takes to keep customers coming back. Analysts predict that today's $200 billion AI market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade. In addition, Supermicro has delivered a growth rate that's five times faster than the industry average over the past 12 months, thanks to its ability to quickly serve its customers' needs.\n\nWorking closely with Nvidia\n\nSupermicro's products share many similar parts, making it easy to customize a specific piece of equipment for a particular customer. The company also works closely with the world's top chip designers -- including Nvidia -- to immediately integrate its latest releases into its equipment.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Supermicro is ramping up its production capabilities by, for example, adding a new facility in Malaysia to focus on lower costs and higher volume. The company says the Malaysia factory should help boost both operating margin and net income over time, metrics that already have grown over the past few years. SMCI Operating Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAll of this could keep Supermicro ahead of its rivals. On top of this, its expertise in the cooling of computational systems should serve as a new growth driver.\n\nSupermicro makes a direct liquid cooling (DLC) system that can be added to its equipment. This technology wasn't sought after a few years ago, but today, with AI workloads producing tremendous heat in data centers, the company's DLC is set to take off. The company predicts liquid-cooled data centers will grow from less than 1% in the recent past to as much as 30% of all data centers within the coming two years.\n\nCould Super Micro soar in the second half?\n\nLet's get back to our question: Could Supermicro repeat its performance and beat Nvidia in the second half of the year? It's possible. After all, the stock is considerably cheaper than Nvidia from a forward price-to-earnings perspective, so investors looking for a bargain AI bet could favor Supermicro.

        "content": "Sometimes, the success of a company can take the stock so high that it pushes investors away.\u00a0It is\u00a0due to\u00a0this reason that the management\u00a0announces\u00a0a stock split.\n\nWhile a stock split does not change anything in terms of the fundamentals of the company, it makes it easier for investors to own the stock. 2024 has been the year for stock splits and there are many stock split candidates that could make the big announcement.\n\nRight from the tech darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to the popular Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), they have all gone through splits this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRetail investors pounce on the opportunity of a stock split and make the most of the opportunity.\n\nA lower price means the stock becomes easily affordable and usually gets a boost after it starts trading at the new price. Here are three companies that are ideal stock split candidates for the year. Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nUp 41% year-to-date, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock is exchanging hands for $834 and is one of the top pharma stocks to own. The company has reported impressive revenue growth, driven by the obesity drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro.\n\nIt hit the 52-week high of $960 earlier this month and has seen a pullback lately. Besides weight loss, the company also has a solid portfolio of drugs used in cancer and it was recently granted FDA approval for\u00a0donanemab, its Alzheimer\u2019s drug.\n\nAfter receiving the FDA approval for Mounjaro in 2023, the company has seen steady sales growth. It generated $1.8 billion in revenue in the first quarter while Zepbound generated $517 million.\n\nThese are two blockbuster drugs in the market that have seen massive demand and Eli Lilly has invested\u00a0$9 billion in a new manufacturing facility to boost production.\n\nThe company\u2019s upcoming quarterly results could push the stock toward $1,000 and make it difficult for investors to own it. It is clear that the demand for weight loss drugs is high and Eli Lilly is\u00a0in the position\u00a0to make the most of it.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been on a rally for 18 months and is up 147% YTD. Exchanging hands for $705, the stock has been steadily moving higher since the beginning of the year and now would be the ideal time for a split.\n\nIts partnership with Nvidia has given the stock a boost and as Nvidia grows, SMCI follows. The company got a first-mover advantage and as the AI market expanded, it showed tremendous growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt makes servers that help run AI processors and microchips and the company has seen impressive demand\u00a0across the world. The future is AI and with the demand steadily rising, SMCI is at the right place\u00a0at the right\u00a0time. Super Micro Computer added three new facilities this year to meet the demand.\n\nThe company was recently added to the Nasdaq 100 index which will give it more exposure as mutual funds and ETFs that track this index will buy the shares.\n\nFundamentally, SMCI has become a hot property. In the\u00a0third quarter, it saw a 200% jump in revenue to hit $3.85 billion and it is aiming for\u00a0a revenue\u00a0of $14.7 billion for the full year.\n\nWhile a stock split does not\u00a0change anything fundamentally for\u00a0the company, it can make the stock cheaper for investors. As SMCI inches closer to $1,000, a stock split could be on the cards.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) debuted in 2007 and the company has never split its stock. This year could be different. Trading at $1,650, the stock is valued at a premium and is up 8% YTD. It is up 40% in the past 12 months and the company doesn\u2019t pay dividends either.\n\nThe Latin American e-commerce company is very similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and operates in a market\u00a0where it has seen tremendous growth. It has diversified into fintech and focuses on digital payments. The biggest benefit that the company has is its location.\n\nIt operates in Latin America where fintech is still in the growth stage and\u00a0there is minimal competition. In the\u00a0first quarter, it saw a 36% YOY jump in revenue to $4.33 billion and 59% of the total revenue came from Brazil. Even its advertising revenue grew 64% YOY.\n\nAs a business, MercadoLibre is a lucrative undertaking and generates adequate cash to keep investing in new opportunities. Its e-commerce segment saw massive growth and the\u00a0business\u00a0reported an EPS of $6.78 per share.\n\nMELI stock could keep\u00a0moving higher, driven by the strong fundamentals and market expansion.\u00a0MercadoLibre is in\u00a0a very strong\u00a0position to benefit from the growing popularity of e-commerce and digital payments. The company will report results next week and could keep the momentum going.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It has been over a year since the generative artificial intelligence craze took off, triggering a spike in the share prices of semiconductor companies whose GPUs feed into that market. The most prominent players have been Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), with the former being my focus in this analysis.\n\nWhile both stocks initially surged, the first half of 2024 has not been as favorable to AMD. Nevertheless, the company's shares have risen more than 20% year to date at the time of writing, though they still trailed significantly behind Nvidia (up roughly 168%), which has surpassed expectations.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMD.\n\nAMD's stock has surged due to anticipated growth in the AI industry. However, research and development costs have been eating away at operational profits as the company strives to keep pace with Nvidia in the AI chipset space. AMD faces strong competition from Nvidia and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), but is positioning itself as a formidable contender in this market. Despite lagging behind Nvidia in its GPU offerings, I believe AMD is now set for another period of growth. With the stock price dipping below fair value, it deserves an upgrade to strong buy once again. AMD Is Positioned for Growth Amid AI Revolution\n\nAMD Data by GuruFocus\n\nThe company manufactures a suite of semiconductor products, including GPUs and data center chips with AI applications. Bulls argue this positioning should drive strong growth fueled by generative AI demand, leading to improved results and higher earnings per share in the future. AMD is accelerating its GPU roadmap and plans to launch new Instinct chips in the fourth quarter of 2024 and fiscal 2025. Recently, the company revealed two new processors: the Ryzen AI 300 Series processors built on its XDNA 2 architecture and the Ryzen 9000 Series processors for desktops built on the Zen 5 architecture. Additionally, AMD is intensifying efforts to expand its Instinct accelerator lineup, which could significantly boost the top line and free cash flow, helping narrow the valuation gap between AMD and Nvidia.\n\nAs such, AMD appears well-positioned to capture some AI chip demand as its products continue to improve, though it will be challenging to catch up with competitors. The company is positioning itself to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the space, but will have immense obstacles to overcome in doing so.\n\nNvidia has a first-mover advantage and stronger financials overall. While AMD aims to gain market share from Nvidia, it could face pricing pressure as the dominant player has more runway to compete. Even with intense competition, I believe the industry's growth will allow both players to achieve significant growth in the coming years as AI continues to transform the world. By capturing AI chip demand and expanding its product offerings, AMD is poised for substantial growth. The company's strategic initiatives and new product launches suggest a bright future despite the competitive landscape. The AI revolution presents opportunities for both AMD and Nvidia, making the former a compelling investment option at its current valuation.\n\nStory continues AMD Is Positioned for Growth Amid AI Revolution\n\nSource: AMD Investor Relations\n\nUpcoming processor launches and accelerated pipeline\n\nAs mentioned previously, AMD is poised for rapid growth with its upcoming product rollouts. The company is set to launch two processors soon: the AI 300 Series for laptops in July and the Ryzen 9000 Series for desktops, with shipments starting in August. The AI 300 Series targets content creators handling demanding AI workloads. Both chips are expected to provide significant tailwinds for its core processor business.\n\nAMD is also accelerating its GPU product pipeline to compete more effectively with Nvidia's H100. Earlier this year, the company launched the Instinct MI300X accelerator, aiming to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the data center GPU market. With strong endorsements from industry players like Lenovo (HKSE:00992) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the current Instinct MI300X accelerators have shown promise. The company plans to release the AMD Instinct MI325X accelerator in the fourth quarter and the AMD Instinct MI350 Series in 2025. The MI350 Series boasts up to a 35 times increase in AI inference performance compared to the MI300 Series, making AMD's chips a compelling alternative to Nvidia's high-priced H100 chips. The MI400 series is expected in 2026, signaling AMD's move toward an annual GPU release cycle. AMD Is Positioned for Growth Amid AI Revolution\n\nSource: AMD Investor Relations\n\nExpanding AI server partnerships\n\nAMD is quietly expanding its partnership network in the AI server chip space. One of its largest partners is Microsoft, which has shown significant optimism about its AI products. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the MI300X for its price-to-performance ratio on GPT-4. Further, Microsoft's Azure cloud now offers AMD-based virtual machines optimized across the hardware and software stack, integral to the AI infrastructure running GPT-4 Turbo and Microsoft's Copilot. As Copilot technology gains traction among over 340 million users, demand for AMD's chips is likely to rise.\n\nThe company's partnership network also includes other blue-chip tech companies like Lenovo, Dell (NYSE:DELL), Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPE), Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which use AMD accelerators in its offerings. As these partners' revenues grow, driven by AI demand, AMD stands to profit significantly, even with a modest share of the market.\n\nFinancial performance and outlook\n\nOver the past several years, AMD has consistently met or exceeded analyst expectations, with the exception of the third quater of 2022, a challenging period for many companies across the market. This solid track record highlights the company's ability to outperform market \"base\" expectations. However, achieving nominal top and bottom-line growth has proven more challenging.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, AMD reported 80% year-over-year revenue growth in its data center segment, driven by strong shipments of the AMD Instinct MI300X GPU and double-digit growth in server CPU sales. Despite this, overall revenue growth was significantly impacted by sharp declines in the Gaming and Embedded segments. From my perspective, the future trajectory of AMD's business, particularly its Data Center segment, is more critical and will likely become the core of its operations. AMD Is Positioned for Growth Amid AI Revolution\n\nSource: AMD Investor Relations\n\nAMD's revenue growth was a modest 2% year over year in the last quarter, compared to Nvidia's staggering 262% increase. However, as the company accelerated its Instinct MI300 shipments in the second quarter, the company is poised for stronger revenue and free cash flow tailwinds.\n\nWhile AMD may not overtake Nvidia in the data center GPU market in the near term, its free cash flow growth potential is likely underrated. The company generated $379 million in free cash flow in the last quarter, equating to a 7% FCF margin, compared to Nvidia's $14.90 billion in FCF and a 57% margin. Nevertheless, AMD's free cash flow margin has improved from 4% in the fourth quarter of 2023, partly due to the high-margin Instinct MI300 processor shipments. AMD Is Positioned for Growth Amid AI Revolution\n\nSource: AMD Investor Relations\n\nWith GPU-related revenue potentially doubling to $8 billion next year (my estimate, given the current supply-demand imbalance in the GPU market), AMD is set to see a significant improvement in free cash flow. Consensus forecasts suggest 28% revenue growth for AMD next year, reaching $33 billion. A moderate increase in the free cash flow margin to around 15% could imply a total free cash flow potential of close to $5 billion in 2025. Given that AMD achieved about $1.10 billion in free cash flow in 2023, the company could potentially quadruple its free cash flow by then as well. This growth may be underrated as the market's focus often remains on Nvidia's leading top-line growth rates and FCF margins.\n\nMargin resilience and strategic investments\n\nAMD's gross margin has shown resilience, with strong expansion in the last quarter. The company expects further expansion in the second quarter, guiding a 53% gross margin outlook. This strength is largely due to robust growth in the Data Center and Client segments, which have offset margin headwinds in the Gaming and Embedded segments.\n\nHowever, the company's operating margin remained flat year over year. The 150 basis point improvement in gross margin was offset by a 23% year-over-year increase in selling, general and adminstrative expenses in the last quarter. Management has explained the company is investing aggressively in research and development and marketing to capitalize on significant AI growth opportunities. These investments are crucial, as they indicate the company is focusing on the right areas to power future success. R&D is critical for staying competitive in the tech-heavy semiconductor design and manufacturing industry. By continuing to invest in R&D, AMD is taking the necessary steps to catch up to Nvidia or at least reduce its significant market share.\n\nUnderdog valuation potential\n\nI favor AMD primarily due to its underdog status and its relatively lower valuation compared to Nvidia. Over the long term, the company is expected to grow its earnings per share faster than Nvidia, largely because its GPU development pipeline has been lagging. This gap presents considerable \"catch-up\" and revaluation potential for AMD. Intel, which recently introduced its own AI chips (the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator for the enterprise market), also has significant potential. However, the market remains overly bearish on Intel, which is reflected in its low forward price-earnings ratio.\n\nCurrently, AMD shares are valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 24.80 compared to Nvidia's ratio of 30.70. Intel is the most affordable among the three with an earnings multiple of 13, though it has faced challenges such as delayed processor launches. While Nvidia has outpaced both AMD and Intel in growing its Data Center and consolidated revenues in recent quarters, AMD is making significant strides. With the promising Instinct MI accelerator pipeline, AMD has an attractive risk-reward setup.\n\nIf AMD can execute well with its Instinct chip releases, maintain high demand for GPUs and achieve significant free cash flow margin improvements, it could potentially trade at a price-earnings ratio similar to Nvidia's, around 30 to 32 times. This would imply a fair value range of $200 for AMD, offering about a 10% safety margin from current levels, even on a relative valuation basis. AMD Is Positioned for Growth Amid AI Revolution\n\nSource: Alpha Spread\n\nAMD's stock price has recently dipped below its fair value, providing a margin of safety for investors. My discounted cash flow analysis forecasts a 33% revenue CAGR over the next five years (growth stage) and anticipates operating margins to grow to 34% by the end of this period, aligning with Wall Street estimates. AMD Is Positioned for Growth Amid AI Revolution\n\nSource: Alpha Spread\n\nGiven the AI accelerator business is likely a high-margin sector, further improvements in operating margins are plausible. The DCF model uses a discount rate of 9.70% and a terminal growth rate of 2%. Based on these conservative estimates, AMD's current fair price is approximately $232, indicating a safety margin of about 22%. This current consolidation period presents a strategic opportunity to invest with a built-in margin of safety, supported by conservative valuation metrics. By leveraging its growth potential, solidifying its market position and executing its product strategy effectively, AMD is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanding AI and semiconductor markets, promising substantial returns for long-term investors.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAMD has positioned itself as a formidable contender in the semiconductor market, leveraging its strong product pipeline, strategic partnerships and underdog status to capitalize on the AI revolution. While facing stiff competition from Nvidia and Intel, AMD's aggressive R&D investments and upcoming product launches indicate a promising trajectory. With its current valuation offering a margin of safety, AMD presents a compelling investment opportunity for those looking to benefit from the rapidly expanding AI and semiconductor markets.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Turnaround AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 67% and 93%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Excitement about artificial intelligence drove shares of CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) to record highs earlier this year. But the stocks have since tumbled 31% and 34%, respectively.\n\nCrowdStrike's losses happened quickly, precipitated by a faulty software patch that caused a global IT outage last weekend. Super Micro Computer's losses accumulated gradually following mixed financial results in the March quarter. But certain Wall Street analysts view the stocks as significantly oversold, and they expect shares to rebound sharply.\n\nIn July, Ittai Kidron at Oppenheimer raised his price target on CrowdStrike to $450 per share, citing a robust product pipeline, including a new generative artificial intelligence assistant. His forecast implies 51% upside from its current share price of $263. In April, Ananda Baruah at Loop Capital raised his price target on Supermicro to $1,500 per share, citing increased confidence in its leadership position in artificial intelligence servers. His forecast implies 93% upside from the current share price of $776.\n\nInvestors should never set too much store by price targets, but CrowdStrike and Supermicro warrant further consideration. Read on to learn more.\n\nCrowdStrike: 67% implied upside\n\nCrowdStrike sells about two dozen cybersecurity software products through a single artificial intelligence (AI) platform. The company is best known for its leadership in modern endpoint security, a category concerned with protecting devices like desktops. CrowdStrike captured 21% market share in modern endpoint security software last year, and that figure will approach 24% this year, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nLeadership in endpoint security is advantageous because endpoint devices are the primary source of threat intelligence for enterprises. As such, CrowdStrike has a material data advantage that (arguably) makes its AI models uniquely effective in detecting cyberthreats. CEO George Kurtz recently told analysts CrowdStrike has the \"industry's most effective and accurate AI models to prevent attacks.\"\n\nCrowdStrike is also gaining momentum in other markets. Analysts have recognized its prowess in cloud workload security, ITDR (identity threat detection and response), and MDR (managed detection and response). Beyond that, the company has one of the fastest-growing SIEM (security information and event management) products on the market, and its generative AI assistant (Charlotte AI) is gaining traction with customers, according to Kurtz.\n\nLet's talk about the elephant in the room. On July 19, CrowdStrike pushed a defective update that caused millions of machines running the Windows operating system to crash. The massive IT outage disrupted businesses across numerous industries, from banks and airlines to hospitals and 911 call centers. Shares plummeted on the news.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortunately, CrowdStrike responded quickly and effectively. There may be further downside in the near term, such as legal action or difficulty winning new customers. But those headwinds should fade eventually. Malik Ahmed Khan at Morningstar wrote, \"We think the pullback represents a good buying opportunity for long-term investors.\"\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects revenue to increase at 26% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). That estimate makes the current valuation of 20 times sales look tolerable. Patient investors comfortable with volatility should consider buying a small position today. The stock may not return 67% over the next year, but I think CrowdStrike can beat the S&P 500 over the next three to five years.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: 93% implied upside\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs and manufactures high-performance computing platforms for data centers, optimized for use cases like data analytics and artificial intelligence. Its portfolio includes complete server and storage solutions, server subsystems like motherboards and chassis, and server management software. The company sources chips from suppliers like Nvidia and AMD.\n\nSupermicro has emerged as a leader in the AI server market due to its internal design competencies and modular approach to product development. Specifically, the company manufactures and assembles most servers internally in Silicon Valley, which enables rapid prototyping and product launches. It also uses common building blocks across product lines, which allows its engineers to quickly build a broad range of products equipped with the latest chips.\n\nSupermicro generally beats competitors to market with new technologies, often by two to six months. Jim Kelleher at Argus believes that advantage cements its leadership in AI severs. \"Supermicro is emerging as a go-to provider for data center implementation of GPU computing infrastructure used in training large language models (LLMs), inference, deep learning, and other elements that enable generative AI applications,\" he wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nSupermicro reported mixed financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 2024). Revenue surged 200% to $3.85 billion, missing the $3.9 billion analysts anticipated. But non-GAAP earnings increased 308% to $6.65 per diluted share, topping the Street consensus of $5.57 per diluted share. Notably, CEO Charles Liang attributed the top-line shortfall to supply constraints, not a lack of demand.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Supermicro to grow non-GAAP earnings at 41% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends June 2026). That estimate makes the current valuation of 40.5 times non-GAAP earnings look quite reasonable. Investors should consider buying a small position in Supermicro today, but not with the expectation of a 93% return in the next 12 months. There is no guarantee the bears are done selling.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Everyone\u2019s definition of \u201cconsumer stocks\u201d is different.\n\nStrictly speaking, I would say that companies operating in the consumer discretionary sector are the best examples of consumer stocks. However, others in the industry might suggest that consumer staples companies are also to be included in the larger group of constituents that are consumer stocks.\n\nWhen selecting consumer stocks to buy and sell, using the holdings of popular ETFs is a good way to develop investable ideas. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLY) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP) are two appropriate examples.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThey represent the consumer discretionary and consumer staples stocks within the S&P 500. XLY has 52 holdings while XLP has 38. I\u2019ve selected at least one name from each sector. While they\u2019re both up more than 7% in 2024, they are trailing the index badly in 2024.\n\nWord to the wise. If you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll get your money out of these three stocks before the end of 2024.\n\nTyson Foods (TSN) Tyson (TSN Stock) chicken in a package.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) share price is up nearly 7% year-to-date, less than half the return of the index. Given the actions of its suspended CFO John Tyson, I\u2019m amazed it\u2019s in positive territory at all.\n\nOn June 13, Tyson was arrested by the University of Arkansas police and charged with driving while intoxicated and careless driving after an officer witnessed the Tyson heir drive up on a curb. Tyson said he wasn\u2019t drinking but ultimately said he had consumed up to seven beers. Unsurprisingly, his blood alcohol level was twice the 0.08 legal limit in Arkansas.\n\nIn November 2022, Tyson was arrested after falling asleep in a woman\u2019s apartment in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He was charged with criminal trespassing and public intoxication.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine anyone keeping their job after two incidents of public intoxication but the CFO of a public company? That\u2019s a red flag for investors in my opinion. CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram seemed to agree.\u00a0Reuters reported in June:\n\n\u2018At some point, the board will need to decide when enough is enough,\u2019 said Arun Sundaram, analyst with CFRA Research. \u2018It\u2019s difficult to imagine many other high-ranking executives retaining their positions after several legal incidents.\u2019\n\nThere are good family-controlled businesses and there are bad ones. Tyson is a bad one.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nBy the time this is published, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) will have been removed from the Nasdaq 100 and replaced by Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), the manufacturer of high-performance servers, whose shares are up more than 175% in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis isn\u2019t a surprise move by the index, given WBA stock has lost 58% of its value in 2024. To remain in the index, you must have a market capitalization of at least 0.1% of the total of all 100 companies. Right now, that works out to about 0.05%.\n\nThat\u2019s the one shoe to drop. The other will be when it is escorted from the S&P 500. It hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it will be soon enough.\n\nMeanwhile, CEO Tim Wentworth told analysts in its Q3 2024 conference call that the drug store chain would close many of its stores as part of the company\u2019s turnaround plan.\n\nWhile store closures are a natural move to lower its operating costs, it might be enough to deliver profits for shareholders. It lost $13.1 billion through the third quarter.\n\nWentworth\u2019s turnaround will take several quarters, if not years, to be successful.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) is up over 2% YTD. That\u2019s not great but compared to other publicly traded pizza chains \u2014 Papa John\u2019s (NASDAQ:PZZA) has lost 46% YTD \u2014 it\u2019s hanging in there.\n\nSince former CEO Patrick Doyle announced he was stepping down in January 2018, DPZ stock has more than doubled (124%) in value. This proves that the CEOs who followed Doyle didn\u2019t do a terrible job in the 6.5 years since Doyle\u2019s announced departure.\n\nHowever, in the eight years and three months Doyle was CEO, its shares appreciated by 2,159%, 17x the performance since.\n\nThey say you can\u2019t go back. Domino\u2019s has to push forward with the best plan possible to drive growth. Its plan included a significant international push. That appears to be in jeopardy.\n\nOn July 18, as part of its Q2 2024 results, it indicated that its goal to open 925 stores internationally would fall 225 (24%) short of that in 2024. One of its master franchisees, Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises (DPE) had troubles opening and closing stores during the quarter.\n\nDuring the conference call, its executives were asked if DPE was an isolated incident or if analysts could expect other international master franchisees to deliver fewer stores than planned over the second half of 2024. They didn\u2019t really answer the question.\n\nThat\u2019s a red flag.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), like other AI infrastructure plays, remains under pressure due to the market\u2019s waning enthusiasm for such stocks. It\u2019s been a while since Super Micro Computer stock has taken a big tumble. Still, over the past month the AI server builder\u2019s shares have continued to experience a steady slide in price.\n\nHowever, while SMCI has become a frustrating investment for those who bought in at or near the top, for investors that have sat on the sidelines may soon have reason to get into the game.\n\nJust a few weeks from now, Supermicro will report its latest quarterly results and updates to guidance. While not certain, a mix of strong results and positive changes to outlook could lead to a sentiment shift.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConcerns about GenAI growth tailwinds petering out for this company could ease, paving the way for shares to make a big return to prior price levels. With this in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look. Much suggests going against the grain with SMCI could prove worthwhile.\n\nSupermicro Slump: Why Investors are Hesitant to Buy Super Micro Computer Stock\n\nAI chip market leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has continued hitting new highs, and has only recently started to pull back again. However such nonstop performance has not been universal among AI infrastructure stocks.\n\nOther popular AI semiconductor and AI hardware stocks peaked back in early March. Super Micro Computer stock is no exception. That said, even when compared to other names in the space that have pulled back in recent months, like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), one can say there is a lesser degree of cautious optimism for SMCI.\n\nIn the case of AMD, it\u2019s possible that the AI chip designer could soon live up to past hype. Mostly, via the rollout of its AI-PC chip products. However, with Supermicro, following its revenue miss last quarter, there is greater concern that further disappointment lies ahead. This in turn could lead to a further decline in price for shares.\n\nHowever, just because this sentiment is out there, doesn\u2019t mean you need to stay away. For one, it\u2019s possible that walked-back expectations have already been accounted-for in SMCI\u2019s valuation. Second, upon earnings day, or even shortly beforehand, this company could unveil some promising updates that bring about renewed bullishness.\n\nRebound Potential Before and/or After Earnings\n\nSuper Micro Computer has not set a release date for its Q4 FY2024 fiscal results, but it\u2019s likely to happen early next month. Before and after earnings, there may be the potential for Super Micro Computer stock to surge on positive news and announcements.\n\nStory continues\n\nYes, last quarter, Supermicro didn\u2019t release preliminary results. It may seem like now it\u2019ll be the same case for this quarter. Earlier this month, analysts like Wells Fargo\u2019s Aaron Rakers speculated that a preannouncement could drop between July 18 and July 24. Yet even as we pass this date range, preannouncements could still in theory arrive before the month closes out.\n\nEven if Supermicro waits until earnings day, don\u2019t assume that the company is set to reveal lackluster results and few promising updates. With expectations walked back, Super Micro may be better positioned to beat on revenue. This, coupled with an earnings beat, could drive a post-earnings return to bullishness.\n\nSo too will a guidance update, or updates on positive developments. As Rakers pointed out, these could include updates on Supermicro\u2019s large-scale deployments of GPU clusters to big ticket customers like xAI, and updates on the company\u2019s liquid cooling servers, which could be its next big hit.\n\nBottom Line: Consider SMCI a Buy for the Near and Long-Term\n\nSMCI currently trades for 33 times estimated FY24 earnings, and just 23.3 times estimated earnings for the coming fiscal year. Supermicro\u2019s fiscal performance has clearly caught up with its valuation.\n\nEven if the company experiences a further growth slowdown, there may still be room for it to run, in both the near and long-term. Simply maintaining its current valuation, and by rising in tandem with earnings growth, shares could potentially rise by around 41.4% over the next year.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Supermicro could build on its initial GenAI server success, with the launch of new products like the aforementioned cooling servers. As Seeking Alpha commentator The Alpha Oracle pointed out a few weeks back, SMCI also has growth potential in non-AI verticals, such as 5G, cloud computing, and edge computing.\n\nBottom line: the growth story here hasn\u2019t gone away. However, a reasonable valuation may not last for long. Considering this dynamic, feel free to consider entering a position in Super Micro Computer stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks Doing Even Better Than Superstar Super Micro (SMCI)",
        "content": "With a bull market barely showing signs of slowing down, one of the best outperforming stocks this year is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The premier provider of AI-optimized computers, servers, networks, storage solutions and data center workstations is up 176% year-to-date. That follows its shares more than tripling in value in 2023.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence has been behind the gains made in the semiconductor industry, most notably Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is up 148% so far this year (it rose 239% last year too), many stocks have done even better.\n\nImportantly, it wasn\u2019t AI pushing them along either. There are other great investing themes out there that you would have missed if you only focused on the headline names.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three outperforming stocks that are beating Super Micro Computer in 2024. While they have been star performers in the front half of the year, do they have what it takes to enjoy similar gains in the back half and beyond? Let\u2019s dig in and find out!\n\nAvidity Biosciences (RNA) Avidity Biosciences logo on their headquarters building in San Diego, CA, USA. Avidity Biosciences Inc (RNA) is an American biotechnology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nBiotech stock Avidity Biosciences (NASDAQ:RNA) has risen over 400% this year. But it wasn\u2019t a sudden spike that caused it to be one of the top outperforming stocks on the market. Rather, the biotech stock is on a long, steady climb higher. From its low point last October, RNA stock is up 844%. Yowser! But why?\n\nAvidity Biosciences is taking an innovative approach to delivering a new class of RNA therapeutics called antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates, or AOCs. According to the biotech, its proprietary platform combines \u201cthe specificity of monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, with the precision of RNA therapeutics to target the root cause of diseases previously untreatable with RNA therapeutics.\u201d\n\nYet Avidity is a clinical-stage biotech. It doesn\u2019t have any drugs on the market. It does generate some revenue due to collaborations and partnerships to study how its AOC platform can target specific indications, and they totaled $3.5 million in the first quarter.\n\nAvidity\u2019s lead candidate is del-desiran (AOC 1001), a therapy for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a form of muscular dystrophy. It plans to initiate Phase 3 trials, and in May the Food & Drug Administration granted AOC 1001 breakthrough therapy designation. That declaration expedites the development and review of drugs submitted.\n\nBiotechs are a risky field to invest in, but Avidity Biosciences seems to be on the right path for additional growth. The path to approval, though, is still a long one.\n\nStory continues\n\nJumia Technologies (JMIA) The Jumia logo on a laptop.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfrica is a huge, untapped market, and Jumia Technologies (NASDAQ:JMIA) is looking to, well, tap into it. The startup e-commerce platform is seeking to become the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa and one of the outperforming stocks.\n\nIt generates revenue primarily through commissions from third-party sellers on the pan-African marketplace. Sales soared 19% in the first quarter but were up 57% on a currency-neutral basis. Perhaps most importantly, it is finally on the path to profitability. It hasn\u2019t gotten there yet, but first-quarter losses narrowed significantly, down to $8 million from $28 million a year ago.\n\nAlthough analysts don\u2019t foresee it operating in the black for some time yet, it may have shortened the window considerably.\n\nJumia stock is up 291% this year but more than 360% over the past six months. The problem for the e-commerce stock is the political instability of the continent. It also notes it faces significant currency devaluations in some of its largest markets. However, it is seeing stability return in some markets and both Nigeria and Ghana are enjoying order growth.\n\nBecoming the next Amazon won\u2019t be an easy path, but as Africa modernizes, Jumia could become a long-term outperforming stock. If you invest, however, expect significant volatility in the share price.\n\nMicrostrategy (MSTR) In this photo illustration, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) Incorporated logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe investment thesis behind Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) these days has less to do with with its AI-driven enterprise analytics software and more to do with Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The stock follows the broad strokes of the cryptocurrency\u2019s price movements, though it doesn\u2019t walk lockstep with them.\n\nWhere Bitcoin\u2019s price is up 56% year-to-date, Microstrategy is sitting 173% higher than where it started the year.\n\nThat is because the company views buying the crypto as equally as important as selling its analytics software. Indeed, read a Microstrategy earnings release and you will see more about Bitcoin than you do about software sales.\n\nTo that point, Microstrategy bought 25,250 Bitcoin in the first quarter and held 214,400 BTC at the end of the period. The total cost of the crypto was $7.5 billion, or $35,180 per bitcoin at the time of the release. However, the company updated its holdings on June 20 to say it now held 226,331 Bitcoin, meaning it added almost 12,000 more to its portfolio. Bitcoin currently trades north of $65,900.\n\nTo buy all that crypto, Microstrategy has taken on boatloads of debt. Long-term debt now stands at over $3.5 billion, a 63% increase just from the end of last year. If Bitcoin goes into a steep decline again, Microstrategy could be seriously impaired. The cryptocurrency may be an exciting investment on its own, but there are better ways to acquire it than betting on the one-time analytics software developer.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AVGO Alert: Why Broadcom Stock Is a Top Pick in the AI Chip Sector",
        "content": "Given Broadcom\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) high exposure to the artificial intelligence megatrend, its impressive list of partners and customers and the reasonable valuation of Broadcom stock, I view the shares as a buy for investors looking for increased exposure to large AI chip makers.\n\nAlso working in Broadcom\u2019s favor are the strongly positive sentiment towards the name on the Street and the very impressive quarterly results that the chip maker reported in June.\n\nHigh AI Exposure, Impressive Partners and Customers\n\nLast quarter, Broadcom\u2019s \u201cAI-related revenue\u201d soared 280% versus the same period a year earlier and 35% compared with the previous quarter to $3.1 billion. The latter figure represented nearly 25% of the company\u2019s total revenue of $12.5 billion. Moreover, as its AI revenue continues to grow extremely rapidly in the coming quarters, Broadcom\u2019s exposure to the AI Revolution and the efficacy of Broadcom stock as a play on the AI megatrend will grow rapidly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne of the factors that makes me confident in the firm\u2019s ability to continue quickly increasing its AI revenue is its impressive roster of partners and customers. Among the names on this list are Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), ChatGPT ownerOpenAI and ByteDance, the owner of TikTok.\n\nAdditionally, investment bank TD Cowen recently reported that Broadcom was obtaining a higher amount of company outlays on GenAI and the bank predicted the trend would accelerate in the second half of this year.\n\nVery Positive Sentiment and a Reasonable Valuation\n\nAfter holding conversations with investors recently, Citi, quite remarkably, believes that Broadcom could be catching up with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) when it comes to investors\u2019 outlook. As reasons for the increasingly upbeat view of Broadcom stock, Citi cited the chipmaker\u2019s recent recruitment of ChatGPT and ByteDance, along with the profitability of VMWare, which Broadcom acquired in 2023.\n\nAlso indicating the Street\u2019s sentiment towards Broadcom stock is improving was the decision by investment bank Rosenblatt to hike its price target on the name to $2,400 from $1,650. It also kept its \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock.\n\nAmong the factors cited by the bank for its decision were the company\u2019s \u201cStrength in AI-related infrastructure networking\u201d and its \u201cimproved\u00a0synergies in enterprise software\u201d. Rosenblatt believes the company\u2019s revenue should grow by nearly 20% next year.\n\nMoreover, analysts\u2019 average price target on AVGO stock is $192, well above the shares\u2019 current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd on the valuation front, the shares have a reasonable forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26.8 times. Noteworthy is the fact that the shares have dropped roughly 12% since June 17, creating a good entry point.\n\nVery Strong Quarterly Results\n\nLast month, Broadcom reported its top line soared 43% versus the same period a year earlier to $12.5 billion. Net income, excluding certain items, also jumped to $5.39 billion from $4.5 billion in Q2 of 2023. Impressively, free cash flow came in at $4.5 billion, representing a very high 36% of its revenue. Since the Street tends to embrace companies with high profit margins, the latter figure is quite significant.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure software revenue accelerated as more enterprises adopted the VMware software stack to build their own private clouds,\u201d Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement.\n\nThe Bottom Line on AVGO Stock\n\nGiven Broadcom\u2019s strong exposure to the AI megatrend, Broadcom looks poised to continue rapidly expanding its top and bottom lines. What\u2019s more, the Street\u2019s positive sentiment towards the name should boost the stock in the near-to-medium terms. The stock\u2019s valuation is also reasonable. In light of these points, I urge investors looking for increased exposure to Big Tech and AI to buy the shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in ANET and SMCI.

        "title": "Stocks to Sell: 3 Falling Knives to Dump Before Things Get Worse",
        "content": "Selling stocks just because of the negative momentum riding behind them is not typically a good idea. However, for the firms that have lost their way, with questionable (and perhaps deteriorating) long-term growth narratives, decaying fundamentals, or other uncertainties that could weigh heavily on one\u2019s longer-term (think three to five years or more) investment thesis, it may be better to cut one\u2019s losses. These stocks to sell are falling knives that you need to avoid before getting stuck.\n\nIndeed, a troubled stock can keep on tumbling for quite some time. This is especially true for those that didn\u2019t sport a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. It is also true for any other valuation metric, for that matter to begin with.\n\nManagement reshuffling and other potential \u201cred flags\u201d may also be contributors to why one would part ways with a stock. In this piece, we\u2019ll look at three falling knife stocks that may be worth dumping. Afterall, the long-term story seems just a bit too hazy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLululemon (LULU) A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nLululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) was the hot apparel play as athleisure and comfort (over style) trended in 2021 and 2023. Nowadays, it seems somewhat less appropriate to look like you just came from the gym in most settings that do not entail athletics. That\u2019s had a devastating impact on LULU stock. The stock finds itself down almost 45% from its all-time high of $511.\n\nThough shares appear like they\u2019re on the discount rack at 19.7 times forward P/E. I fail to see any significant drivers that could reverse recent damage to the stock.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s not just about athleisure versus other trends that have me worried. I am also worried about the company\u2019s ability to keep charging high prices in an athletic apparel market. This is because it is saturated with competitors. If Lululemon can\u2019t gain traction at the Paris 2024 Olympics (it\u2019s dressing the Canadian Olympians again), perhaps the nearly 50% haircut may be the start of Lulu\u2019s pains.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA) stock just can\u2019t seem to catch a break, with shares recently getting the boot from the Nasdaq 100 for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). Indeed, getting kicked out of a major exchange for the lack of performance is not a good sign.\n\nAt writing, WBA stock has now shed more than 86% of its value from peak levels. It\u2019s sitting at 27-year lows. There may be some deep value. However, the company has some serious issues it needs to address to win back the confidence of investors and Wall Street analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) recently slashing its WBA stock price target by $10 to $20 per share over \u201cchallenging\u201d recent results, it\u2019s tough to find much to get behind the name right here as it closes 300 stores in just a couple of months. You can see how this made our list of stocks to sell.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is hardly a falling knife compared to Walgreens Boots Alliance. That said, CMG stock has been reversing in a hurry in recent weeks, now down close to 22% from its short-lived June peak. Though I see nothing alarming to rush to the exits over, I do find the valuation to still be rich.\n\nAt writing, CMG shares trade at 56.9 times trailing P/E. That\u2019s a huge premium to the quick-serve restaurant industry. It is also one that may not be worth paying even if the company is primed to keep firing on all cylinders. While the company\u2019s long-term growth narrative remains outstanding, I see no reason to pay a premium multiple for it, especially now that momentum has turned so violently.\n\nIn short, Chipotle\u2019s a great company, but one that could afford to take an even steeper plunge as investors rotate to value and slightly away from top-tier growth as CMG stock\u2019s massive 50-for-1 split comes into effect. Do yourself a favor and dump all of these stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Where Will Super Micro Computer Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "With shares up by over 4,100% in the last five years, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is one of the few tech stocks that has trounced Nvidia -- the current leader in AI hardware. It likely outperformed because of its smaller size and historically lower valuation.\n\nBut with its market cap of $47 billion, Super Micro is no longer a small, undiscovered tech stock. Let's dig deeper to find out if it can still maintain market-beating growth over the next half-decade.\n\nSuper Micro's role in the AI ecosystem\n\nInterest in generative AI software exploded after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. However, from an investor perspective, the biggest winners have been the infrastructure companies supplying the hardware that makes training and running large language models (LLMs) possible.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, Supermicro is not a chipmaker. Instead, it turns the chips designed by other companies into ready-to-use computer systems and servers. This niche allows it to benefit tremendously from the soaring demand for Nvidia's AI-capable graphics processing units (GPUs). The impacts of this boom are evident in its fiscal third-quarter earnings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNet sales jumped 200% year over year to $3.85 billion based on demand for plug-and-play AI servers for data center clients. Management expects to continue gaining market share by creating new server designs. Part of Supermicro's edge comes from its focus on energy efficiency. This can lead to cost savings for clients, which is becoming increasingly important due to the sheer volume of energy required for AI workloads.\n\nWhat will the next five years have in store?\n\nWhile Supermicro's niche has allowed it to perform spectacularly well over the previous five years, the next half-decade might be more difficult. Right now, the company seems to be piggybacking off the innovations of Nvidia and other AI GPU makers more than its own. And this might make it more vulnerable to competition in the data center server market.\n\nRivals like Dell and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise fulfill a similar role of turning AI GPU chips into ready-to-use data center servers. Over the next five years, these companies could pressure Supermicro's economic moat, which would hurt its growth potential and margins.\n\nIn the third quarter, Supermicro's gross margin (sales minus cost of goods sold as a percentage) fell from 17.6% to 15.4%. This trend suggests the company's pricing power is declining, and it might be relying on reducing prices to support its expansion. For comparison, Nvidia's gross margin increased from 43.5% to 70.1% in its most recent quarter because it is much harder for clients to replace its products.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Super Micro Computer stock a buy?\n\nSupermicro has become a Wall Street darling by serving as a middleman between AI chipmakers and their data center clients. This role has allowed it to benefit from the soaring demand for Nvidia GPUs, and this business probably won't go away anytime soon. That said, investors should expect margins to continue declining as competition rises.\n\nThe good news is that with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 22, Supermicro's shares are significantly cheaper than Nvidia, which has a forward P/E of 46. The market seems to be pricing in Supermicro's potential challenges, so it remains a relatively affordable way to bet on the long-term AI opportunity despite its recent rally.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Does This Valuation Of Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Super Micro Computer is US$593 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Super Micro Computer's US$797 share price signals that it might be 34% overvalued Our fair value estimate is 43% lower than Super Micro Computer's analyst price target of US$1,035\n\nDoes the July share price for Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nThe Method\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$954.1m US$1.27b US$1.51b US$1.73b US$1.91b US$2.07b US$2.20b US$2.31b US$2.41b US$2.50b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x5 Analyst x4 Est @ 19.10% Est @ 14.09% Est @ 10.57% Est @ 8.12% Est @ 6.39% Est @ 5.19% Est @ 4.35% Est @ 3.76% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8%  US$885 US$1.1k US$1.2k US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.2k US$1.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$12b\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$2.5b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.8%\u2013 2.4%) = US$48b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$48b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$23b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$35b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$797, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Super Micro Computer as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.168. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings.\n\nWeakness\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "title": "1 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Soars 84%, According to Loop Capital",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), more commonly known as Supermicro, is one the of market's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Its shares have rallied 2,290% over the past three years as its sales of AI servers skyrocketed.\n\nYet Supermicro remains a divisive stock among analysts. Susquehanna's Mehdi Hosseini expects it to drop 60% to $325, while Loop Capital's Ananda Baruah says it can soar 84% to $1,500. Can it really hit that Street-high price target? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow fast is Supermicro growing?\n\nSupermicro controls a much smaller slice of the traditional server market than Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE). However, it carved out its own niche by selling high-performance servers.\n\nThat focus made Supermicro an ideal partner for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which initially granted it access to its high-end data center GPUs before its larger competitors. That partnership gave Supermicro a first-mover advantage in AI servers, and the growth of that business accelerated over the past few years as the AI market expanded.\n\nFrom fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2021 (which ended in June 2021), Supermicro's revenue increased at an anemic compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of less than 1% as it struggled with pandemic-driven disruptions and supply chain constraints. But from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023, its revenue rose at a CAGR of 42% as its EPS skyrocketed at a CAGR of 134%.\n\nThat acceleration was driven by its brisk sales of dedicated AI servers, which generated about half of its revenue by the end of fiscal 2023. Bank of America estimates Supermicro's share of the AI server market will rise from 10% in 2023 to 17% in 2026 as the entire market expands 150%. Research and Markets expects the global AI server market to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% from 2024 to 2029.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Supermicro's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 58% and 52%, respectively. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 27 times next year's earnings.\n\nThe bull case vs. the bear case\n\nThe bulls believe Supermicro will maintain its early-mover advantage in the AI server market, continue to grow its market share, and expand beyond Nvidia-powered AI servers through new deals with AMD and Intel.\n\nIn Loop Capital's latest investor note in April, it said Supermicro's business \"remains healthy\" and will profit from the expansion of the AI market. Loop Capital also co-managed a $1.7 billion senior unsecured convertible notes offering for Supermicro this February, so it might have a deeper insight into its core business than other Wall Street firms.\n\nStory continues\n\nAssuming Supermicro meets Wall Street's expectations and still trades at 27 times forward earnings, its stock price could nearly hit $1,100 by the beginning of fiscal 2026. To hit $1,500 by then, it would need to be trading at about 37 times forward earnings. That's not terribly expensive for a high-growth AI stock, but it's a bit pricey compared to traditional server makers like Dell and HPE, which trade at 24 and 13 times forward earnings, respectively. If Supermicro's growth unexpectedly cools off and it's revalued as a legacy server maker again, its stock could plummet.\n\nThe bears believe that could happen for two simple reasons. First, competition from Dell and HPE -- which are both expanding their AI server businesses -- could curb Supermicro's growth and crush its margins. Supermicro's partnership with Nvidia also isn't exclusive, and its top competitors are buying up a lot of those data center GPUs. Second, the broader AI market could gradually cool off, and that slowdown might be exacerbated by tighter regulations, geopolitical tensions, and export curbs.\n\nDoes Loop Capital's price target seem reasonable?\n\nI'm optimistic about Supermicro's future, but I don't think it will hit $1,500 in three years. I believe its strengths outweigh its weaknesses, but the average price target of just over $1,000 seems more reasonable in this choppy market. Over the long term, Supermicro could soar past $1,500 if it maintains its lead in liquid-cooled high-end servers and expands its slice of the AI server market. That said, investors should buckle up and brace for a lot of volatility before it reaches that target.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to connected technology and devices that can communication between themselves and the cloud. An example is a smart home device communicating to a home\u2019s thermostat to adjust the temperature. Another could be a stove preheating itself before one arrives home from work.\n\nIoT is expected to assist with being more energy efficient, optimizing supply chains and better managing inventory levels. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to accelerate and advance the adoption of IoT. Could it eventually lead to machines and technology making decisions on their own, independent of human intervention? Time will tell.\n\nSo, let\u2019s delve into three IoT stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s considered by many people to be a meme stock, yet its shares are not without risk. However, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) remains a leading IoT company. Originally a smartphone maker, BlackBerry has become a cybersecurity and IoT concern over the past 15 years. Until recently, management had been planning to split the cybersecurity and IoT divisions into separate publicly traded companies.\n\nThat plan was shelved as the company continues to struggle financially. By June\u2019s end, BlackBerry reported a quarterly loss that grew by nearly 300% year-over-year (YOY) as the company\u2019s sales deteriorate. Latest results amounted to a 7 cent per share loss, compared to a 2 cent loss the previous year. Revenue totaled $144 million in Q1, down 61% from $373 million a year earlier.\n\nDespite poor results, BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer (CEO) John Giamatteo said on an earnings call with analysts and media that the company is on a \u201cpath to profitability.\u201d Earlier this year, the company eliminated 200 jobs and closed six of its 36 global offices. Giamatteo, who became CEO of BlackBerry last December, said the cuts should deliver $125 million in total cost savings. BB stock has declined 50% in the last 12 months.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTechnology giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) runs an \u201cInternet of Things Cloud Service\u201d that enables businesses to correlate, aggregate and filter incoming data and make sense of it. This is one of many offerings from Oracle, a diversified tech giant that is mostly focused on software development. Currently, IoT is a small but growing part of Oracle\u2019s business. Yet, it is helping the company\u2019s earning and share price.\n\nSo far this year, ORCL stock is up 33%. The company\u2019s cloud business recently got a boost from deals inked with Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and privately held OpenAI. Specifically, Oracle is bringing its database to Google\u2019s cloud platform. Going forward, organizations will be able to deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data centers without being subjected to data-transfer charges. Additionally, Oracle is moving its headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nStory continues\n\nORCL stock has risen 140% over the last five years.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) makes the servers that power IoT technology, and business is booming. Owing to demand from both AI and IoT applications and models, SMCI stock has been on fire over the past year. Year-to-date (YTD), Super Micro Computer\u2019s stock has gained 180%, making it the best-performing component of the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nOn July 22, Super Micro Computer\u2019s stock is being added to the Nasdaq 100 index, marking another milestone for the fast-growing technology concern. The company\u2019s market capitalization swell to nearly $50 billion was the catalyst to this accomplishment. Inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 should give SMCI stock a boost as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index will be required to buy its shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL.

        "title": "2 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has delivered impressive gains of 414% in the past decade, outperforming the S&P 500 index's gains of 185% by a huge margin. A key reason why technology stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 during this period is because of their ability to deliver impressive growth as they can capitalize on disruptive trends. This is precisely why it would be a good idea for investors to buy and hold top tech stocks for the long run.\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Oracle(NYSE: ORCL) are two tech stocks that are benefiting from artificial intelligence (AI), the latest disruption in the tech world that is impacting multiple industries and is expected to contribute significantly to the global economy.\n\nLet's look at the reasons why buying and holding these tech stocks for the next decade could turn out to be a smart move.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer manufactures server and storage solutions, and the stock has been on fire in 2024 with stunning gains of 208% already. However, Super Micro Computer still remains a top tech stock to buy and hold for the next decade because of three simple reasons.\n\nFirst, the company is operating in a market that has received a massive boost thanks to AI. According to Statista, the market for AI servers is forecast to generate a humongous $430 billion in revenue in 2033 as compared to $31 billion last year. That translates into a compound annual growth rate of 30%.\n\nThe second reason to buy Supermicro is that it is becoming a key player in this lucrative market. That's evident from the fact that it's growing at a faster pace than the AI server market. The company's revenue for fiscal year 2024 (which ended on June 30) is expected to land at $14.9 billion, which would be more than double the $7.1 billion revenue it generated in the previous fiscal year.\n\nThe fact that Supermicro is outperforming the AI server market is an indication that it is becoming the go-to provider of AI server solutions. As it turns out, Supermicro is also outperforming established players such as Dell Technologies. More importantly, KeyBanc analyst Thomas Blakey expects Supermicro's AI server market share to increase to 23% this year, a level it will likely sustain in the future thanks to its competitive advantages.\n\nIf that's indeed the case, Supermicro's revenue could increase significantly in the long run thanks to the potential size the AI server market is expected to attain. This brings us to the third reason why buying this stock looks like a no-brainer now in light of the potential growth that it could deliver.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro is trading at just 4.4 times sales right now, which is lower than the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector's sales multiple of 7.4. Also, its forward earnings multiple of 25 is lower than the index's reading of almost 30. With Supermicro's earnings expected to clock an annual growth rate of 62% over the next five years, buying this AI stock looks like a smart move.\n\n2. Oracle\n\nThe proliferation of AI is lifting Oracle's boat as well. This is evident from the company's recent quarterly reports, which point toward an improvement in the demand for its cloud infrastructure offerings.\n\nFor instance, Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPOs) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on May 31) increased 44% year over year to $98 billion. That was faster than the 29% year-over-year increase in its RPO in fiscal Q3 to $80 billion. This faster increase in Oracle's RPO -- which refers to the value of a company's future contracts that are yet to be fulfilled -- points toward an improvement in its future revenue pipeline.\n\nManagement expects its revenue pipeline to keep improving due to the growing demand for cloud-based AI services. According to a statement by CEO Safra Catz: \"Throughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong AI demand to push Oracle sales and RPO even higher -- and result in double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year. I also expect that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous quarter -- as OCI capacity begins to catch up with demand.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that Oracle's revenue in fiscal 2024 increased 6% year over year to $53 billion. So, the forecast for double-digit growth in the new fiscal year suggests that AI is indeed set to drive stronger growth for the company. Another important point to note here is that Oracle signed more than 30 AI sales contracts worth more than $12.5 billion in the previous quarter. That number is very close to the $14.3 billion revenue that the company generated in fiscal Q4.\n\nAI, therefore, is already driving the needle in a significant way for Oracle. The good part is that this trend is here to stay as the demand for cloud AI services is forecast to take off significantly in the long run. Fortune Business Insights estimates that the cloud AI market could grow from $60 billion last year to almost $398 billion in 2030, clocking a compound average growth rate of nearly 31%.\n\nAs a result, Oracle's cloud business has a lot of room for future growth, which should positively impact the company's overall business development. Not surprisingly, analysts are forecasting healthy double-digit earnings growth from Oracle over the next three fiscal years following a tepid increase of just 8% in the previous fiscal year to $5.56 per share. ORCL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nWith Oracle stock trading at just 23 times forward earnings right now, a discount to the Nasdaq-100's multiple, now would be a good time to go long. Thanks to the multibillion-dollar opportunity in the cloud AI market, it could deliver more gains over the coming decade.\n\nThe stock is already up 35% in 2024, and it won't be surprising to see it head higher thanks to the stronger growth it is expected to deliver.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market has grown rapidly over the past few years as companies developed new algorithms to analyze data more efficiently. The rise of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT has also been driving companies to explore new ways to create content, automate tasks, and replace human workers.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global AI market could still expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6% from 2024 to 2030. That's why many AI-driven stocks -- including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) -- rallied over the past year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut in the first quarter of 2024, some closely followed billionaire hedge fund managers sold those three high-flying AI stocks. Let's see how many shares they sold -- and whether it makes sense for long-term investors to follow that lead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia, the leading producer of high-end data center GPUs for processing complex AI tasks, is still one of the market's hottest tech stocks. However, several prominent billionaire investors -- including Philippe Laffont, Ken Griffin, and Israel Englander -- significantly reduced their positions in Nvidia in the first quarter of 2024. Laffont and Griffin both sold 68% of their shares, while Englander reduced his fund's stake by 35%.\n\nThose sales seem premature considering the market's demand for Nvidia's data center GPUs is still outstripping its available supply and giving it tremendous pricing power. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to rise at a CAGR of 46% as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 53%. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that still trades at less than 50 times forward earnings.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nBillionaires are also taking profits in Super Micro Computer, a leading maker of dedicated AI servers. Richard Driehaus, Ken Griffin, and Cliff Asness reduced their stakes in Supermicro by 41%, 8%, and 73%, respectively, in the first quarter.\n\nThat profit-taking is a bit surprising because Supermicro is still firing on all cylinders. It already generates over half of its revenue from dedicated AI servers, and analysts at Bank of America expect its share of that market to grow from 10% to 17% over the next three years. According to Research and Markets, the global AI server market could continue to expand at a CAGR of 26.5% from 2024 to 2029.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), analysts expect Supermicro's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 58% and 52%, respectively. At 27 times next year's earnings, it still looks like an undervalued growth stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, rallied over the past year as its core advertising business recovered. But in the first quarter, several big billionaire investors backed away. Lee Ainslie and Ken Griffin reduced their positions by 51% and 47%, respectively.\n\nBack in 2022, Meta's ad sales were throttled by Apple's privacy-oriented iOS changes, competition from ByteDance's TikTok, and other macro headwinds. But in 2023, its ad sales accelerated as it rolled out new AI algorithms to counter Apple's changes, expanded its Reels short video platform to widen its moat against TikTok, and attracted more spending from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies that wanted to target overseas consumers.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Meta's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 14% and 21%, respectively. That outlook is bright and its stock seems reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings, but its big investors might be worried about a slowdown in spending from its Chinese advertisers and tougher competitive headwinds in the advertising market.\n\nShould investors follow suit?\n\nHedge fund managers have different priorities than retail investors. Instead of focusing on long-term multibagger gains over the course of several decades, hedge fund managers tend to focus on generating stable annual returns to satisfy their wealthy clients. To do so, they'll likely trim their winning positions more prudently than growth-oriented retail investors.\n\nSince the end of the first calendar quarter of March 31, Nvidia's stock has rallied 40%. However, Meta's stock has risen less than 1% while Supermicro's stock has declined 13%. So for the short-term investors chasing billionaire trades, selling Nvidia seemed like a mistake but it was smart to follow their lead and take some profits in Meta and Supermicro.\n\nBut if you're a patient long-term investor who plans to hold these AI stocks for at least a few more years, I don't think there's any reason to follow those short-term trades. Nvidia will continue to sell the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, Supermicro's share of the AI server market will keep growing, and Meta will continue to use its AI algorithms to craft more effective targeted ads across its social media platforms. Therefore, all three stocks could still generate big multibagger gains for investors who don't get too distracted by the near-term noise and the periodic institutional selling.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy for \"One of the Largest Investment Opportunities in Human History,\" According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In June, Swiss investment bank UBS published a report that estimated artificial intelligence (AI) will add $1.2 trillion annually to the global economy by 2027. The analysts divided the AI value chain into three layers:\n\nThe enabling layer includes companies that provide the chips and data center infrastructure needed to train models and build applications. Annual revenue will reach $516 billion by 2027. The intelligence layer includes companies that provide data management tools and AI models that support application development. Annual revenue will reach $255 billion by 2027. The application layer includes companies that use large language models and other machine learning models to build AI products. Annual revenue will reach $395 billion by 2027.\n\nThe report also predicted that \"AI will be the most profound innovation and one of the largest investment opportunities in human history.\" The application layer probably offers the greatest monetization potential over time, but UBS believes companies in the enabling layer will be the biggest beneficiaries during the next three years.\n\nChipmakers Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) and server manufacturer Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) fall into that category.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like AI applications. Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nNvidia has cemented its leadership and enhanced its ability to monetize AI by branching into other product categories. Its portfolio includes adjacent hardware, like central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as subscription software and cloud services that support AI application development.\n\nToshiya Hari at Goldman Sachs sees that as a key differentiator. \"We believe Nvidia will remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive advantage that spans hardware and software capabilities,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"Nvidia's annual introduction of new products and platforms sets a pace of innovation that keeps it at the forefront of the industry.\"\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to grow non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share at 38% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 66.7 times adjusted earnings look tolerable. Investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this semiconductor stock today.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom provides a broad range of IT solutions, but the company is best known for its leadership in data center networking chips (for switches and routers) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Specifically, Broadcom holds 80% market share in data center networking chips and at\u00a0least 55% market share in ASICs. Demand for AI should be a tailwind in both cases.\n\nSwitches and routers move information between data center servers and other networks, and their ability to do so depends on semiconductor throughput. Due to the enormous amount of data involved, fast chips are essential where AI applications are concerned, and Broadcom has the fastest chips on the market. JPMorgan Chase says spending on data center networking chips will grow 20% to 30% annually over the next few years.\n\nASIC refers to bespoke silicon designed for specialized use cases like AI. For instance, Broadcom helps Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms build custom AI chips, and it recently announced a third (unnamed) customer that could be Amazon, Apple, or TikTok parent ByteDance, according to various analysts. ASICs represent less than 10% of AI chips today, but UBS says the market will outpace GPU sales in the coming years, such that ASICs account for 30% of AI chips by 2027.\n\nWall Street expects Broadcom to grow non-GAAP earnings per share at 21% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends October 2027). That estimate makes its current valuation of 36.7 times adjusted earnings look quite reasonable. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a few shares of Broadcom stock today.\n\n3. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer builds high-performance computing platforms for data centers. Its portfolio includes servers and storage systems optimized for use cases like analytics and AI, as well as server management software and server subsystems (chassis, motherboards, power supplies) that can be assembled into complete solutions.\n\nSupermicro is the leader in AI servers, and its market share is climbing due to its in-house manufacturing capabilities and modular approach to product design. To elaborate, the company can quickly build a broad range of servers featuring the latest chips by using common building blocks, and it assembles most of those servers internally in Silicon Valley. That enables rapid prototyping and product roll-out.\n\nIndeed, Supermicro can usually bring new technologies to market before its competitors, often two to six months\u00a0earlier. Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt Securities recently highlighted that advantage. \"Super\u00a0Micro has developed a model that is very, very quick to market. They usually have the widest portfolio of products when a new product comes out from Nvidia or AMD or Intel.\"\n\nSupermicro accounted for 10% of AI server sales in 2023, but Bank of America analysts expect that figure to reach 17% by 2026. Tom Blakely at KeyBanc is even more optimistic. He thinks Supermicro could capture a 23% market share in AI servers by 2025. Either way, those forecasts bode well for shareholders. JPMorgan Chase says the AI server market will grow 460% between 2023 and 2027.\n\nWall Street expects Supermicro's non-GAAP earnings per share to increase 41% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends June 2026). That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 42.3 times adjusted earnings look reasonable. As a caveat, investors should watch competitors like Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to ensure Supermicro maintains its market share. But I believe Supermicro shareholders will be rewarded with market-beating returns over the next three years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this server technology company have returned -12.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, to which Super Micro belongs, has lost 10.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nSuper Micro is expected to post earnings of $8.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +130.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.82 points to a change of +101.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $34.31 indicates a change of +44.1% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Super Micro is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for SMCI _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate of $5.3 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +142.6%. The $14.93 billion and $23.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +109.7% and +60.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +200%. EPS of $6.65 for the same period compares with $1.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.89%. The EPS surprise was +15.05%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Prediction: This Stock Will Benefit Even More Than Nvidia From the AI Boom",
        "content": "When you think of artificial intelligence (AI) winners, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) may be the first to come to mind. The company holds 80% of the AI chip market, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering some of the most important workloads out there. Nvidia's earnings have climbed in the triple digits in recent quarters thanks to this dominance, and its stock's performance has followed.\n\nBut my prediction is that another company will benefit even more than Nvidia from the AI boom over the long run. This particular company not only wins when it launches a new product, but it also scores a victory when Nvidia and any of the world's top chip designers release something new.\n\nIn addition, this company has reported soaring earnings in recent years -- and this year, its stock has even been outperforming Nvidia's. It's advanced more than 180%, while Nvidia's climbed 140%. Let's take a closer look at this current and future AI winner. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA 30-year-old business\n\nThe company I'm talking about is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of servers, workstations, and full rack scale solutions that you'll find throughout AI data centers. Supermicro has been around for more than 30 years, but its business truly took off in recent times, thanks to the AI boom.\n\nFor example, Supermicro's liquid-cooling technology garnered only about 1% market share over most of the company's history. Now, the company expects as much as 30% of all data center operations to use liquid cooling within the coming two years. AI's intense computational power generates significant heat, and this is set to continue as capabilities increase -- but liquid cooling solves the problem.\n\nThe popularity of Supermicro's products and liquid-cooling features have helped revenue to soar. The company recently posted its first $3 billion quarter -- a level of revenue that it reported for a full year as recently as 2021. Demand for its full rack scale solutions continues at record levels, the company has said in its latest earnings report.\n\nAnalysts are expecting the AI market to grow from about $200 billion today to more than $1 trillion by end of the decade, so demand for Supermicro's products is likely to continue climbing.\n\nIncreasing revenue opportunities\n\nBut why could this company benefit even more from the AI boom than Nvidia? Nvidia's revenue opportunities increase every time it releases a new product -- and that's the same for most companies. Supermicro, however, sees its revenue opportunities increase each time the biggest chip companies, such as Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices, release a new chip.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis happens because Supermicro integrates these chips into its products, creating something new for its customers. To ensure this new wave of revenue happens sooner rather than later, Super Micro works closely with the chipmakers to monitor their release schedules. This way, it's ready to customize products for its customers as quickly as possible.\n\nThis strategy has worked. Supermicro has a growth rate that's five times faster than its industry over the past 12 months.\n\nLooking ahead, the company should benefit as Nvidia releases its new Blackwell architecture and chip, set for later this year. But as mentioned, Supermicro's sales also will climb as other chipmakers launch products, so its fortunes aren't tied to just one chip company. Meanwhile, Nvidia's successes are tied to its ability to remain well ahead of rivals.\n\nThat's why I predict that Supermicro, boosted by growth across a range of major AI players, will benefit more from the AI boom than chip giant Nvidia.\n\nWhat does this mean for investors? If you're looking for a solid long-term AI stock, Supermicro could be a safer bet than Nvidia -- and it's demonstrated its ability to offer returns that are particularly strong.\n\nOn top of that, Supermicro, trading for only 24x forward earnings estimates, compared to 43x for Nvidia, looks dirt cheap, considering its growth so far and what may lie ahead. So now is a great time to get in on this player, which could become one of the biggest winners of the AI growth story.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "While thousands of companies will report second quarter earnings in the next few weeks, there are a handful of companies that are \u201cmust-see\u201d earnings reports. These are some of the best known, and most popular, companies.\n\nAll eyes will be on these five for a variety of reasons. Several are part of the Magnificent 7. Many investors own those 7 large cap stocks. But several others are simply popular growth stocks that have hit new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nQ2\u2019s Must-See Earnings Reports\n\nWhat will they say about the US, and global, economies? Is the recession here or will the Fed achieve a soft landing?\n\nSeveral companies are booming thanks to the AI revolution. Will AI still be a driver of earnings and sales in Q2?\n\nWhile there are a lot of companies that people will be tuning into during this earnings season, these 5 are the most important of all. You won\u2019t want to miss them.\n\nThe 5 Most Important Stocks to Watch During Q2 Earnings Season\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surprised on earnings 5 quarters in a row. In fact, it has a great earnings surprise track record with just 1 miss in the last 5 years and that was in early 2023.\n\nApple shares are up 19% year-to-date and are hitting all-time highs. Yet Apple trades at 35x forward earnings. Is Apple too hot to handle?\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) has beat 4 quarters in a row. That is a turnaround from a string of misses in 2021 and 2022.\n\nEli Lilly has been one of the hottest stocks on the Street. It is up 55.4% year-to-date. Eli Lilly is trading with a high valuation, as it has a forward P/E of 70. Will Eli Lilly continue to execute?\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) has beat 5 quarters in a row. It also has a solid 5-year earnings surprise track record, with just 3 misses during that time. That is impressive given the pandemic.\n\nShares of Chipotle are up 21% year-to-date and hit new all-time highs. However, Chipotle isn\u2019t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 51.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Super Micro Computer Next?",
        "content": "At the end of May, I noted five high-flying artificial intelligence stocks that seemed primed for a stock split.\n\nSure enough, in a span of weeks, three of those five went ahead and announced splits.\n\nThat of course leaves two others with sky-high stock prices and continued AI momentum. Here's why one of them, Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), may be the next to split.\n\nThe best-performing stock in the S&P 500\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Supermicro was a relatively unknown stock, with a market cap that relegated it to the small-cap Russell 2000 index. However, with a massive 246.2% gain in 2023 and then another 188.2% gain in the first half of 2024, Supermicro elbowed its way into the S&P 500 index in the first half, making it the biggest gainer in the index, even outpacing Nvidia. In July, the accolades kept rolling in, as it was just announced Supermicro will be admitted to the Nasdaq-100 index on July 22.\n\nAfter the tremendous run in the stock, Supermicro touched a high of $1,229 back in February, before pulling back to $879 per share as of this writing.\n\nCould a stock split be coming? While stock splits don't change the value of a company at all, they do usually mark a vote of confidence on the part of management. Supermicro's stock is definitely in the territory where other companies recently split their stock. But how does management plan to maintain and grow this valuation after its tremendous run?\n\nCan Supermicro maintain this valuation level?\n\nObviously, Supermicro caught lightning in a bottle with AI, as its building-block server architecture, fast time to market, and power-efficient designs were perfectly suited for the AI era. As such, Supermicro has seen its revenues and earnings explode over the past two years, as it has grabbed far more share of the AI server market than it had of the traditional server market.\n\nBut after the skyrocketing growth over the past two years, is there really opportunity for further growth? Supermicro now trades at 48.8 times trailing earnings and 24.8 times its 2025 earnings estimates. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAre AI chips topping out, or just getting started?\n\nSupermicro has generally followed the trajectory of Nvidia, which at some level makes sense. After all, Supermicro's AI servers include Nvidia's chips, which it then marks up between 14% and 17% -- Supermicro's gross margin target -- for the value-add that Supermicro provides with its server architecture.\n\nSo, one leg of growth will have to do with the AI accelerator market, which is mostly Nvidia but will also include Nvidia's competitors as they ramp their competitive offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some have cautioned that AI investment may soon peter out, given the strength of the current boom, others are more optimistic. It's true that the most enthusiastic commentators are semiconductor executives perhaps \"talking their book,\" such as Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su, who forecasts a $400 billion AI chip market by 2027 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's management, which forecasts a 50% average growth rate for AI chips through that time. But these executives have a strong track record.\n\nSupermicro does seem confident in the market's growth. Not only will the company bring its Malaysia factory online very soon, but management just announced it would be building three new manufacturing facilities right in the heart of Silicon Valley, which will soon double the company's capacity for liquid-cooled \"supercluster\" capacity.\n\nLiquid cooling to expand the market and boost Supermicro's profits\n\nOne thing critics have pointed to as a limiting factor on AI growth is the tremendous amount of electricity required to power it all. To that end, Supermicro CEO Charles Liang thinks the near future of AI supercomputing will depend on liquid cooling technology.\n\nTo date, liquid cooling has only garnered about 1% of the data center market, according to Liang. This has traditionally been due to the difficulty of managing liquid cooling systems in data centers, plus the extra cost.\n\nHowever, now that AI chips require so much electricity, and liquid-cooled racks greatly reduce the amount of heat generated and the need for large air conditioning systems, liquid cooling now makes much more sense. According to Liang, a liquid-cooled data center can cut operational expenses for AI data center operators by 40%.\n\nAnd Supermicro has been preparing for this moment, having invested in liquid-cooling technology over the recent past. Last quarter, the company's inventory greatly increased, which Liang noted was due to accumulating parts for a big liquid-cooled push in the back half of the year.\n\nAs Supermicro is just on the cusp of bringing liquid-cooled racks to the server market, that should bode well for growth and margins. The more differentiated its offerings and the greater the operational costs it can cut for customers, the more it will be able to maintain margins on typically high-dollar but low-margin AI servers.\n\nLiquid cooling set to take 30% of the market\n\nLiang believes liquid-cooled racks will eventually grow from 1% of the data center market to 15% of the market in 2025 and 30% in 2026. If that's true and Supermicro continues its first-mover innovation, look for it to maintain or even grow its heady valuation. And if its stock price goes high enough, a stock split isn't out of the question.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Recent Stock Downgrades Smart Investors Should Note",
        "content": "The S&P 500 has continues to edge higher.\n\nA softer-than-expected inflation report for June fueled hopes that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in September. Several major investment advisory firms sifted their forecasts for Fed rate cuts and stock downgrades.\n\nThe CPI report showed only a slight 0.06% increase in core inflation, excluding food and energy prices. The data suggests a deceleration in inflation since the beginning of the year. A notable slowdown in the previously high housing services inflation hints at diminishing inflationary pressures.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe moderation in core CPI elements has led analysts to believe that the inflation trend is on a downward trajectory. Discrepancies exist between the CPI and the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. But, the overall pattern indicates a sustained reduction in inflation rates.\n\nEarlier in the week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell shared his concerns about achieving a balanced economic \u2018soft landing.\u2019 This involves managing inflation without undermining the employment market.\n\nThe recent cooling of the labor market has lessened the threat of wage-driven inflation. But it also raises concerns about potential increases in unemployment. In the past, the robust labor market granted the Fed the leeway to wait for clear signs of easing inflation before making policy changes. However, current conditions suggest that delaying rate cuts could carry greater risks.\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) economists project that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will reduce the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in September, followed by an additional 25 basis point cut in December. Evercore also expects a rate cut in September.\n\nAs a result of this improving macro backdrop, valuations are becoming stretched. And analysts are forced to cut ratings on the biggest winners, resulting in stock downgrades.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nNomura (NYSE:NMR) adjusted its rating on Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), shifting from a buy to a neutral rating. The firm has maintained its price target for the company at $930.00.\n\nThe change in rating comes after Super Micro Computer offered strong guidance for the periods of CY4Q23 to CY1Q24. The analyst notes that the company\u2019s position has evolved from easily surpassing modest market expectations in CY4Q23 to facing a tighter margin for exceeding the already elevated market expectations in CY1Q24.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis shift is attributed to two main uncertainties: the gradual easing of CoWoS-S supply in CY2024F and the potential transition period between Hopper and Blackwell GPUs in the second half of CY2024F.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, the analyst acknowledges SMCI\u2019s competitive edge with its liquid cooling solutions, which are expected to support the company\u2019s gross profit margin (GPM). However, the limited order visibility, due to the aforementioned uncertainties, may challenge Super Micro Computer\u2019s ability to achieve sales that surpass expectations, leading to stock downgrades.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nUBS Group (NYSE:UBS) analysts lowered the rating for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares from neutral to sell, despite increasing the price target from $147 to $197. The analysts pointed out that Tesla is recognized for more than its automotive sector. It has promising developments in Energy and Full Self-Driving (FSD). However, the expectations for its core Auto business are declining.\n\nTSLA is poised to report earnings on July 23rd, following a strong Q2 delivery performance. Analyst consensus estimates the Q2 earnings per share (EPS) at 47 cents. The last time Tesla exceeded EPS expectations was in Q2 of 2023, with a 13% surprise.\n\nAnalysts concluded that the current market valuation leaves a significant portion, over $500 billion, attributed to anticipated future growth. To rationalize the present stock prices, a future value of $1 trillion would need to be realized within five years.\n\nThe report further stated that Tesla\u2019s investment in artificial intelligence (AI) technology is substantial. But the returns may be long-term and the rate of progress could decelerate. The concern is that if market interest in AI wanes, Tesla\u2019s stock multiple might be affected.\n\nGiven these uncertainties and the potential for growth opportunities to emerge later than expected or not at all, coupled with the stock trading at 86 times next twelve months (NTM) price-to-earnings (P/E), the downgrade to sell was justified.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Exterior view of Nvidia's global headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Since its founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw New Street Research cut its rating on the company\u2019s shares last week. The research firm downgraded NVIDIA from buy to neutral, setting the price target at $135.00. Stock downgrades like this reflect growing concerns in the market.\n\nThe downgrade was prompted by the analyst\u2019s view that NVDA\u2019s upside potential is limited under the current conditions. The consensus among market participants suggests that GPU revenues are expected to rise by 35% by 2025, aligning with previous forecasts.\n\nHowever, the firm sees little room for further growth based on the latest insights from the value chain. According to New Street Research, the likelihood of significant gains for NVIDIA\u2019s stock hinges on a bullish scenario. That would be if the outlook beyond 2025 markedly improves.\n\nCurrently, there is no strong conviction that this scenario will unfold. Market projections indicate a revenue growth deceleration to mid-teens. And this might be threatened by a slowdown in hyperscale capital expenditures and increased competition from ASICs and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThe quality of NVIDIA\u2019s franchise remains solid, and the firm would consider re-entering a buying position should the stock demonstrate prolonged weakness.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Long-Term Tech Stocks for Extending Investment Horizons",
        "content": "Is the tech trade really over? Much is being written about investors rotating capital out of high-flying technology names and into value and small-cap stocks. While the rotation is seen as healthy and likely to prolong the current market rally that began in late 2022, it seems doubtful that technology stocks will trail for long.\n\nFirst of all, tech firms tend to be the engines of innovation and growth in the economy. That fact has only accelerated with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Second, the quarterly financial results of technology companies justify their stock\u2019s performance and lofty valuations. With the economy and consumer spending remaining resilient, there\u2019s no reason to assume that there will be an earnings downturn.\n\nLastly, technology companies, particularly the mega-cap variety, have a dominant position in the markets in which they compete. Some, it can be argued, have near-monopoly positions. That also looks unlikely to change or be seriously challenged in the near future. Here are seven longevity tech stocks extending investment horizons.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe good news keeps on coming for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The latest tailwind for the stock is that it\u2019s being added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing\r\npharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). SMCI stock will officially start trading on the Nasdaq 100 July 22. The Nasdaq 100 is comprised of the 100 largest non-financial companies in the broader Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 should give its stock a boost as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index will now be required to buy its shares. Super Micro Computer makes servers that run AI microchips and processors and its products are in high demand worldwide. SMCI stock has more than tripled so far in 2024. Earlier this year, the company\u2019s stock was added to the benchmark S&P 500 index where it remains the top performing security.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of winning tech stocks, how about software firm turned Bitcoin (BTC-USD) powerhouse MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR)? The company\u2019s stock has performed nearly as well this year as Super Micro Computer. Since January, MSTR stock has gained 141%, driving its share price up to $1,654.18 and leading the company to announce a 10-for-1 stock split that goes into effect on August 8.\n\nWhile technically a provider of enterprise software, MicroStrategy has switched its focus in recent years and adopted an aggressive Bitcoin-buying strategy. Michael Saylor, the company\u2019s executive chairman, has said that MicroStrategy is now primarily focused on Bitcoin development and blockchain technologies. At the end of June this year, MicroStrategy owned 226,331 Bitcoin worth $14.59 billion based on the current price of the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Wall Street firm Bernstein recently said that MicroStrategy is \u201cbuilding the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin company\u201d and that the stock has a further 80% upside.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nGoogle parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is well-known as a leader in AI. However, Alphabet is still a diversified technology company that has its tentacles in many other areas of technology, from smartphones to cybersecurity. The company\u2019s role in cybersecurity looks likely to expand with the expected acquisition of Wiz, a privately held firm that specializes in cybersecurity for cloud computing.\n\nMultiple media reports say Alphabet is planning to spend $23 billion to purchase Wiz, in what would be its biggest acquisition ever. Wiz was founded in 2020 and had been planning an initial public offering (IPO) later this year. However, it now looks as though Wiz will be content to sell itself to Alphabet instead. The purchase comes as Alphabet makes growing its cybersecurity offerings a key priority.\n\nIn 2022, Alphabet acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion. Alphabet\u2019s stock has risen 33% so far this year and the consensus rating among 38 analysts who cover the company is that the shares are a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of \u201cstrong buy\u201d ratings, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also holds one, along with a median price target that is 17% above where the stock currently trades. Investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently named Dell a \u201ctop pick\u201d and said the company\u2019s share price could rise as much as 40% over the next 12 months. At the start of July, Dell stock was added to Bank of America\u2019s (NYSE:BAC) coveted \u201cU.S. 1 List\u201d of top investment ideas.\n\nThe bullish sentiment is due to the opportunity Dell has in front of it with AI, notably the servers that run AI applications and models. That business is expected to accelerate and become more profitable in coming quarters. At the same time, Dell\u2019s core personal computer (PC) business is expected to outperform in coming quarters as a global refresh leads to accelerating PC sales this year and throughout 2025.\n\nDELL stock has increased 80% so far this year, with more gains likely, according to analysts.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs far as bullish sentiment goes, few stocks have experienced as big a turnaround in recent weeks as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). At the start of the year, Apple couldn\u2019t do anything right. The media was awash with headlines about slumping iPhone sales, rising competition in China, and a new augmented reality headset that, at more than $3,000, was too expensive for most consumers. But ever since Apple unveiled its AI strategy in June, its been blue skies for the company\u2019s stock.\n\nAAPL stock has risen 40% from a 52-week low reached in April. The shares are now up 25% on the year and trading near an all-time high on a split adjusted basis. The rebound comes after Apple announced plans to add advanced AI technology to future versions of the iPhone. Analysts say the addition of AI should spur global sales of the smartphone in coming years.\n\nAdditionally, Apple has just expanded sales of its Vision Pro augmented reality headset, rolling it out in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and U.K. Suddenly, Apple stock looks unstoppable once again.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nAs mentioned with Alphabet, cybersecurity remains a hot corner of technology right now. And among cybersecurity stocks, CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the king. Over the past 12 months, CRWD stock has increased 143%, including a 50% gain so far this year. Analysts and investors stood up and cheered after the company\u2019s last financial results, which beat Wall Street estimates across the board.\n\nCrowdStrike reported EPS of 93 cents, which was above the 89 cents expected among analysts. Revenue for the year\u2019s first three months totaled $921 million, up 34% from a year earlier and ahead of estimates calling for $905 million in sales. CrowdStrike\u2019s free cash flow stood at $322.5 million at quarter\u2019s end, up 42% from a year ago. If there\u2019s a knock on CRWD stock it is the valuation.\n\nShares currently trade at nearly 700x future earnings estimates. While pricey, many analysts continue to see CrowdStrike as the de facto leader among cybersecurity stocks.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nWe\u2019ll end with a dark horse candidate: design software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). The company behind products such as Photoshop, Illustrator and the PDF has seen its share price driven 3% lower this year over concerns that AI is going to effectively put it out of business. However, reports of Adobe\u2019s demise appear to have been greatly exaggerated based on the company\u2019s most recent quarterly print.\n\nADBE stock rose 17% after the company reported financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and raised its full-year guidance. Adobe announced Q1 EPS of $4.48 compared to $4.39 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $5.31 billion versus $5.29 billion that had been estimated. Sales rose 10% from a year earlier. Rather than be replaced by AI, management said on an earnings call that they are using the technology to their advantage.\n\nSpecifically, Adobe is adding AI across its suite of creative products, including Firefly and Illustrator, and charging a premium for it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks With Scorching-Hot Upside of Up to 100%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Roughly 30 years ago, the advent and subsequent proliferation of the internet changed the growth trajectory for businesses worldwide. Since then, investors have been patiently waiting for the next game-changing technology to come along and rival what the internet did for corporate America. After an extended wait, artificial intelligence (AI) looks to have answered the call.\n\nThe \"rise of AI\" involves the use of software and systems for tasks that humans would normally handle. Moreover, these AI-driven systems have the capacity to learn and evolve over time without human intervention. This ability to grow more proficient at assigned tasks, as well as potentially learn new skills, gives AI utility across the board. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLast year, the analysts at PwC released a report (Sizing the Prize, PwC's Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution) that estimated AI would add $15.7 trillion to the global economy via consumption-side benefits and productivity gains come 2030.\n\nWith this seemingly limitless addressable market, Wall Street's financial institutions and analysts have paid close attention to the AI revolution. While most analysts expect meaningful upside to come from cutting-edge AI stocks, certain companies might have an inside track to outsize gains.\n\nAccording to select Wall Street analysts, three AI stocks offer scorching-hot upside of up to 100% over the next 12 months.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside of 55%\n\nTo no one's surprise, the first artificial intelligence stock pegged by at least one Wall Street analyst to deliver outsize gains over the next year is leading hardware provider and innovator Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nRosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann increased his and his firm's price target on Nvidia to $200 from $140 following the company's recent 10-for-1 stock split. If Mosesmann's forecast were to prove accurate, the company would have a roughly $5 trillion market cap, and existing shareholders would enjoy an additional 55% upside from where shares closed on July 12.\n\nOne aspect of Mosesmann's optimism has to do with the company being on the pole position when it comes to AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs). On top of its H100 GPUs currently dominating in AI-accelerated data centers, it plans to introduce its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture later this year, and its Rubin platform in 2026. There's a realistic chance that Nvidia's chips will retain a clear advantage over the competition.\n\nMosesmann is equally excited about Nvidia's software. For instance, he believes the company's CUDA platform -- a tool kit used by developers to build large language models -- will go hand-in-hand with its hardware to keep businesses under its umbrella of products.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut even though Nvidia's operating ramp-up has been virtually flawless, expecting close to $1.8 trillion in added upside to the company's already lofty valuation seems unlikely. History has a knack for spoiling the euphoria that fuels next-big-thing innovations. Over the last 30 years, no new innovation or trend has avoided an early-stage bubble, and artificial intelligence probably isn't the exception.\n\nFurthermore, there's a very real scenario in which Nvidia retains its GPU advantages and still loses. In addition to increasing external competition, Nvidia's top customers by net sales are all developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. Both the scarcity that's driven the prices of these GPUs into the stratosphere, and the data center space needed to fuel demand for Nvidia's hardware, are going to diminish. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMobileye Global: Implied upside of 100%\n\nA second AI stock with mouthwatering upside, at least according to one Wall Street pundit, is Mobileye Global(NASDAQ: MBLY), a developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies.\n\nAlthough analyst Itay Michaeli at Citigroup has reduced his and his company's price target for Mobileye on a handful of occasions, the current target of $53 represents a cool 100% upside from where shares parked at the end of last week (July 12).\n\nMichaeli's bullishness primarily has to do with the expectation that advancements in autonomous vehicles (AVs) will -- pardon the necessary pun -- drive the use of Mobileye's solutions. This includes its next-generation EyeQ6H platform, which is a centralized chip with three times the power of its predecessor chip and will be tasked with improving ADAS capabilities in AVs.\n\nMichaeli's research note also points to advancements in Mobileye's SuperVision, the company's end-to-end ADAS technology that is enabled by 11 cameras, Road Experience Management-based AV maps, and the company's next-gen centralized EyeQ chips. SuperVision claims to support Level 2, 3, and 4 autonomous capabilities.\n\nAnother factor working in Mobileye's favor is its pristine balance sheet. This is a company generating positive operating cash flow that, as of March 30, had $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents with no debt.\n\nHowever, reaching $53 per share could prove challenging. Even with next-gen vehicles becoming increasingly reliant on technology, we've witnessed tepid demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in recent quarters. With industry stalwarts like General Motors and Ford Motor Company scaling back their investments in EVs, it's become evident that Mobileye's growth prospects could ebb and flow as the EV industry and technology matures.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside of 65%\n\nThe third artificial intelligence stock that can offer scorching-hot upside over the next 12 months, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is customizable rack server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nDespite Supermicro's stock rallying 220% year to date, and more than 1,000% since the curtain opened on 2023, analyst Ananda Baruah at Loop Capital foresees shares climbing by another 65% over the coming year. Baruah's price target of $1,500 for Supermicro was released in mid-April.\n\nBaruah's research report focuses on Super Micro Computer's positioning within the rapidly growing AI server market, and he expects the company's customizable solutions to be popular as more and more businesses aim to hop aboard the AI revolution. Based on Wall Street's consensus revenue estimates of $14.9 billion in 2024 and $24 billion in 2025, Supermicro's sales are expected to grow by 237% in just a two-year stretch.\n\nBut keep in mind that Super Micro Computer's growth trajectory is heavily reliant on Nvidia. The company's high-end rack servers incorporate Nvidia's H100 GPUs -- and Nvidia is already working with a sizable backlog for its H100. Supermicro's growth prospects could dwindle if AI-GPU scarcity persists longer than expected.\n\nHistory is also doubly concerning when it comes to Super Micro Computer. For one, expectations were high during the early stages of the cloud-computing boom in the mid-2010s. Unfortunately, the company's growth rate failed to live up to lofty expectations. In other words, we've seen Supermicro fail to live up to the hype before.\n\nThe other concern echoes what I noted earlier about Nvidia. Every game-changing innovation, technology, and trend since the mid-1990s has needed time to mature, and we're not there yet with AI. With most businesses lacking a well-defined plan to benefit from artificial intelligence, Supermicro, like Nvidia, would be exposed to significant downside if and when the AI bubble bursts.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Walgreens Boots Alliance Is Leaving The Nasdaq 100: Is This High-Yield Stock On The Ropes?",
        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance Is Leaving The Nasdaq 100: Is This High-Yield Stock On The Ropes?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nBeing pushed out of an index is never a positive thing for a stock. It can be a sign that a company's best days as a strong grower are behind it. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has been pushed out of the Nasdaq 100 in favor of fast-moving Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), a hardware company that builds servers. The Nasdaq 100 is an index that tracks the performance of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The companies on the list cover various sectors, from tech to hospitality to pharmaceuticals. Leaving the list may be another sign that Walgreens is flashing a caution sign for dividend investors.\n\nPrivate credit offers up to 20% APY. Potential accredited investors are looking to capitalize on this growing asset class.\n\nTo be in the Nasdaq 100, companies must have a weighting of at least 0.1% of the Nasdaq 100's market value, now over $20 trillion. Walgreens' stock has fallen by over 56% year to date, paring its market cap down to around $10 billion, which puts it around 0.05%, too small for inclusion. The falling stock price has pumped up Walgreens' forward dividend yield to 8.55%, but that number can be deceptive. The annual dividend is just $1.00 because Walgreens cut its dividend at the start of 2024.\n\nWas The Move To Healthcare A Failure?\n\nSomething dramatic is happening with healthcare in the United States: a move to put more healthcare services in the places we visit most frequently. Large companies, from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Walgreens' rival CVS (NYSE:CVS), have all experimented with expanding healthcare services in their stores and beyond. Walgreens has spent heavily in this area. In 2022, it spent $8.9 billion to acquire Summit Health-CityMD. The vision expressed by then-CEO Roz Brewer was to combine Summit with Walgreens' existing investments in VillageMD with the expectation that healthcare services would command a larger and larger part of Walgreens' revenue.\n\nSo far, that grand plan has failed to pay off. The new CEO, Tim Wentworth, is focused on the bottom line and hasn't seen health care pay off as the company had hoped. He's now trying to wind down the company's investment in VillageMD. Speaking with analysts on the most recent earnings call, he stated: \"We would continue to have some investment and participate in their growth. It will take time. And as I said, we are looking for a different horizon for what we will invest strategically under our leadership.\" During that quarter, Walgreens wrote off $5.8 billion in goodwill related to the money it spent on VillageMD.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the all-in-on-healthcare plan exited the company along with the last CEO, what does that mean for the future? Wentworth sees Walgreens' value as centered on its core retail and pharmacy businesses. \"The bottom line is that I'm confident WBA will be a leader in the future of health care with pharmacy and retail at its center,\" said Wentworth. \"And the long-term potential of the company will be shaped by offerings built around the relationship that we\u2019ve nurtured with our customers over time.\"\n\nFor investors, that means we should think about Walgreens more as a retail company, as judged by sales within its stores. For the most recent quarter, sales were up 2.6%, much of which was driven by pharmacy growth as retail declined. The company is in the midst of a plan to close underperforming stores and shore up the pharmacy business. Will it pay off? Sentiment in the market is relatively negative. Short interest in Walgreens recently spiked to 9.39%, and in the last month, a dozen analysts have lowered their price targets.\n\nTrending: Mark Cuban believes \u201cthe next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment\u201d \u2014 this new real estate fund allows you to get started with just $100.\n\nIs The Rival A Safer Bet?\n\nIt hasn't been an easy few years for the pharmacy business. After the rush from the pandemic vaccine boom wore off, pharmacies struggled with lower traffic and fewer sales. Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy in 2023 and announced closing more stores nationwide.\n\nCVS (NYSE:CVS) may still appeal to investors. While its forward dividend yield is a far lower 4.53%, it raised its quarterly dividend to $0.67 this year. Like Walgreens, CVS has invested heavily in health care, which has slowly paid off. Its last quarter disappointed the market, and CVS lowered its earnings per share guidance. Short interest in this stock is far lower, a mere 1.47%, and analysts are far more optimistic about its prospects with an overall consensus Buy rating.\n\nThe transition to health care is no sure thing, and some of the big companies above have already scaled back operations. In April, Walmart decided to close its clinics, and Amazon also scaled back its ambitions. CVS may be best positioned to turn clinic health care into a profitable business model, but investors will want to weigh that risk carefully before making a purchase.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "content": "Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, data storage, networking, software, and analytics over the Internet or \u201ccloud.\u201d Its advantages include faster speeds and more flexible resources. It also enables companies to achieve economies of scale with their computing services. Given its advantages, it should not be surprising to learn that cloud computing is growing exponentially.\n\nThe global market for cloud computing could grow from $720.99 billion in 2023 to $2.22 trillion by 2031. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%. In one way or another, almost all of the mega-cap technology stocks are cloud computing stocks. And the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to fuel the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nHere are three cloud computing stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) sign reading Google inside building\n\nSource: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) could boost its role in cloud computing through a potential $23 billion acquisition of privately held cybersecurity firm Wiz. Wiz provides cybersecurity specifically for cloud-computing platforms and services. If successfully completed, the acquisition of Wiz would be Alphabet\u2019s biggest deal ever and help advance its cloud computing offerings.\n\nSince the division turned profitable about a year ago, Google Cloud has been a bright spot for Alphabet. In this year\u2019s first quarter, Google Cloud posted revenue of $9.57 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $9.35 billion. The operating income in Google\u2019s cloud business more than quadrupled to $900 million in Q1, demonstrating that the company is generating substantial profits in that business segment.\n\nGOOGL stock has risen 50% in the last 12 months, including a 35% gain so far in 2024.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) makes the servers that enable other companies to build cloud computing infrastructure. Demand for its servers among cloud computing firms has helped to propel Super Micro Computer\u2019s sales and stock to new heights. Not only is SMCI stock the best performer in the S&P 500 index this year, but it has just been announced that the stock is being added to the Nasdaq 100 index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock will officially be added to the Nasdaq 100 before trading on July 22, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). The change reflects both the rise of Super Micro Computer\u2019s stock and the sharp decline in Walgreens\u2019 market value. Super Micro\u2019s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 should boost its stock. This is because mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track the index will buy the shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nSMCI stock has more than tripled year to date, giving the company a market capitalization of $53 billion. Earlier this year, the stock was added to the S&P 500 index, which it now sits atop based on its performance.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a cloud computing stock that\u2019s on sale, look to Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The company\u2019s share price is completely flat on the year (down 0.23%) following a poor earnings report for this year\u2019s first quarter. However, CRM stock is starting to show signs of a rebound as we enter the year\u2019s second half, with its stock having risen 11% in the past month. That\u2019s helped erase much of the loss right after the Q1 print.\n\nWhile the Q1 readout was bad, with Salesforce missing its quarterly revenue target for the first time since 2006, the company appears to be bouncing back. In June, Salesforce, the world\u2019s biggest cloud computing firm, announced that it is opening a new AI center. The company said it plans to eventually create 500,000 AI-related jobs in the U.K. region.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL.

        "content": "A relatively unknown artificial intelligence enabled server seller not long ago, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is now a darling of the financial market. Some folks like to jump on the bandwagon and buy \u201csuperstar stocks.\u201d That\u2019s fine until the music stops and Super Micro Computer stock investors are left holding the proverbial bag.\n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea. Super Micro Computer\u2019s market capitalization could keep growing in this year\u2019s second half. However, it\u2019s a question of risk-versus-reward at this point.\n\nIf you invest in Super Micro Computer now, you have to ask yourself: Am I feeling lucky? And when you find yourself asking that question, you\u2019re probably in a dangerous trade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhen \u2018Buy the Dip\u2019 Goes Too Far\n\nIt\u2019s true that Super Micro Computer stock recently pulled back from its peak price of $1,229. Knowing this, some folks who have been conditioned to buy each and every dip might be tempted to invest in Super Micro Computer right now.\n\nThis, I believe, would be taking \u201cbuy the dip\u201d too far. Investors should put the Super Micro Computer share dip into perspective.\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock was the S&P 500\u2019sbest-performing stock of 2024\u2019s first half. It went up 188% in a six-month period. Even if the stock falls 20% or 30%, that\u2019s a comparatively tiny dip.\n\nReportedly, some of Super Micro Computer\u2019s insiders sold Super Micro Computer shares during the past 12 months. Among the sellers was company founder Charles Liang.\n\nThese insiders\u2019 average share-sale price was approximately $315. So, do you still think Super Micro Computer stock is a bargain at around $900?\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Big Sales, Bigger Share-Price Rally\n\nThe optimists might try to justify the Super Micro Computer share-price rally by pointing to Super Micro Computer\u2019s sales for fiscal 2024\u2019s third quarter. Specifically, the company reported sales of $3.85 billion, up 200% year over year.\n\nThat figure actually fell short of Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimate of $3.99 billion in sales. More importantly, Super Micro Computer stock has gotten ahead of itself, having increased 188% in six months versus Super Micro Computer\u2019s sales growing 200% over a 12-month period.\n\nNow, Super Micro Computer has a trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.12x. That\u2019s notably higher than the sector median P/S ratio of 3.05x.\n\nIt far exceeds Super Micro Computer\u2019s five-year average P/S ratio of 1.12x. This is another sign that Super Micro Computer is a very richly valued market darling.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Stock: Don\u2019t Risk Dollars for Pennies\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying: Don\u2019t try to pick up pennies in front of a steamroller. Even after a relatively minor share-price dip, Super Micro Computer is more than fully valued. It\u2019s too dangerous to buy shares now as the rollover risk is substantial.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf Super Micro Computer stock pulls back an additional 30% or 40% or 50%, then we can certainly revisit this conversation.\n\nFor the time being, however, it\u2019s wise to take any profits you might have, and I currently don\u2019t recommend investing in Super Micro Computer.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Will Weakness in Super Micro Computer, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SMCI) Stock Prove Temporary Given Strong Fundamentals?",
        "content": "With its stock down 8.1% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Super Micro Computer's  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Super Micro Computer is:\n\n21% = US$1.0b \u00f7 US$5.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.21.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Super Micro Computer seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 8.3%. This probably laid the ground for Super Micro Computer's significant 55% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Super Micro Computer's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 29% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Super Micro Computer is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Super Micro Computer Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nGiven that Super Micro Computer doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Super Micro Computer's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC), a growth-focused index heavily weighted toward the technology sector. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) will replace Walgreens Boots Alliance in the Nasdaq-100 before the market opens on Monday, July 22.\n\nSupermicro has become popular with investors in recent months due to its role in the artificial intelligence (AI) economy. The company joined the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) in March, and shares surged 188% during the first half of 2024, outpacing the 150% gain in Nvidia stock.\n\nWall Street thinks that outperformance will continue. Supermicro's median price target of $1,030 per share implies 16% upside from its current share price of $886. Meanwhile, Nvidia's median price of $133 per share implies 4% upside from its current share price of $128.\n\nSuper Micro Computer has a durable competitive advantage\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs and builds computing platforms for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its portfolio spans storage systems and servers, including single devices and full-rack solutions, optimized for AI and high-performance computing. The company has a deep relationship with Nvidia, but it also sources chips from suppliers like AMD and Intel.\n\nSupermicro is the \"leading company in the AI compute market,\" according to JPMorgan Chase analyst Samik Chatterjee. More importantly, it's quickly gaining market share due to engineering prowess and its unique building-block approach to product development. To elaborate, the company handles most research and development internally, and it builds preassembled servers that can quickly be outfitted with the latest chips and interconnects.\n\nAs a result, Supermicro can usually bring new technologies to market faster than competitors, often by two to six months. Additionally, because those server building blocks can be assembled in countless combinations, clients have a great deal of flexibility in buying custom computing platforms. In fact, Supermicro claims to offer the broadest product portfolio in the industry.\n\nEarlier this year, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann highlighted those advantages in a note to clients, saying: \"Super Micro has developed a model that is very, very quick to market. They usually have the widest portfolio of products when a new product comes out from Nvidia or AMD or Intel.\"\n\nSupermicro has also developed building blocks for liquid-cooled AI servers, and it's one of the first companies to ship liquid-cooled racks at scale. That puts Supermicro in a good spot. Liquid cooling can reduce data center power usage by 40%, and Supermicro expects 15% to 30% of data center installations in the next two years to rely on liquid cooling, up from less than 1% historically.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro stock trades at a reasonable valuation compared to Wall Street's earnings forecast\n\nHere's the big picture: Businesses want power-efficient AI servers equipped with the latest chips, especially Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), so they are turning to Supermicro. In turn, the company is gaining market share and extending its leadership.\n\nIndeed, Bank of America analysts expect Supermicro to account for 17% of AI server sales by 2026, up from 10% in 2023. Even more bullish, Keybanc analyst Tom Blakely says Supermicro could capture 23% market share by 2025. He also says the company has \"competitive moats that should sustain if not expand\" its share in coming years.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Supermicro to grow adjusted earnings per share at 59% annually through fiscal 2025 (ends June 2025). That estimate makes its current valuation of 46 times adjusted earnings looks very reasonable.\n\nIn that context, Supermicro has a PEG ratio -- its price-to-earnings ratio divided by forecasted earnings growth -- of roughly 0.78. Using the same methodology, Nvidia currently has a PEG ratio of roughly 1.4, meaning the stock is (arguably) much more expensive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The arrival of artificial intelligence into the mainstream is a boon for the cloud computing industry. AI needs enormous amounts of data and computing power to execute tasks, both of which are readily available in a cloud environment.\n\nTwo prominent businesses benefiting from AI and its impact on the cloud computing market are Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly known as Supermicro.\n\nHere's how these two tech companies are reaping the rewards from the AI-driven cloud computing boom, and if you had to choose just one to invest in, which might prove the better long-term investment.\n\nAlphabet's multifaceted cloud business\n\nAlphabet is perhaps best known for its ubiquitous Google search engine. But it also has a thriving cloud computing business called Google Cloud.\n\nThis division is experiencing rapid growth. In the first quarter, Google Cloud generated $9.6 billion, which is a 28% increase from 2023's $7.5 billion. It is now the third-largest cloud vendor in the world.\n\nGoogle Cloud offers several benefits to its business clients. Like all cloud offerings, customers can use it to augment or replace existing IT infrastructure, such as servers.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet makes its proprietary AI platform available to clients through Google Cloud, so they can create their own AI systems and apps. Instacart uses this feature to improve its customer service workflows.\n\nIn addition, according to CEO Sundar Pichai, \"Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity.\" Its AI-powered cybersecurity features are why Pfizer adopted Google Cloud.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's focused approach to cloud computing\n\nSupermicro provides computer servers and storage solutions, the exact components critical to cloud computing. It focuses on high-performance computing products to cater to the needs of AI-optimized clouds in particular.\n\nSupermicro offers customers an array of options using a modular approach the company calls its \"Building Block Architecture.\" This approach allows it to quickly customize products to meet the technical requirements of its clientele.\n\nThe sudden AI-spurred demand for Supermicro's offerings led to massive sales growth for the company. In its fiscal Q3, ended March 31, Supermicro achieved revenue of $3.9 billion, a 200% increase year over year.\n\nThe company expects its outsized sales to continue. Supermicro is forecasting revenue of at least $5.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter. That's more than double the $2.2 billion in Q4 sales generated in the previous fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro added to its ability to grow revenue through an expanded product line. Its offerings now encompass additional IT infrastructure needs, such as power and liquid cooling systems.\n\nDeciding between Alphabet and Super Micro Computer\n\nThe cloud computing market is expected to see multiyear growth thanks to AI, rising from $588 billion last year to $2.3 trillion by 2032. This growth makes both Alphabet and Supermicro compelling investments for the long term.\n\nHowever, deciding which stock is the better buy can be challenging. In this duel of cloud companies, several factors favor Alphabet.\n\nThe Google parent offers a more diversified business. It has a thriving digital advertising operation, where it's a market leader. Ad sales comprised $61.7 billion of the company's $80.5 billion in Q1 revenue.\n\nAlphabet is also a market leader in online search. Thanks to Google's popularity, Alphabet has a trove of data to feed into and strengthen its AI platform.\n\nAlso, Supermicro battles in a competitive space with rivals including Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n\nCompetition has led to pricing pressure, causing a decline in Supermicro's gross margin to 15.6% in fiscal Q3 from 17.7% in the prior year. Supermicro expects its gross margin to decline further in fiscal Q4.\n\nAnother factor to consider is valuation. Using the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), a widely used metric to assess a stock's value, Alphabet is the winner. This chart shows that Supermicro's valuation has soared in 2024. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nWhile Supermicro's P/E ratio has come down in recent months, shares remain pricier than Alphabet's.\n\nIn addition, Supermicro is not cash-flow positive. It spent $2.7 billion over the past three quarters building up its product inventory. This resulted in negative free cash flow (FCF) of $1.6 billion in fiscal Q3.\n\nAlphabet isn't burdened with maintaining an inventory of goods to sell, helping it to generate prodigious FCF of $16.8 billion in Q1. Over the trailing 12 months, the company's FCF was $69.1 billion.\n\nIts tremendous FCF allows Alphabet to comfortably afford a dividend. Supermicro doesn't offer a dividend.\n\nWhile both companies are enjoying rising revenue thanks to growth in the cloud computing sector, given Alphabet's market-leading products, strong FCF, more diversified business, and better stock valuation, Alphabet is the superior investment at this time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Here Is My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "When it comes to top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy now, the primary one that investors seem to gravitate toward is Nvidia. The company wisely leveraged its core competencies in gaming and graphics processing units (GPUs) to the AI field, which benefited its stock greatly as demand for AI chips soared.\n\nHowever, Nvidia stock has also risen to a nosebleed valuation, a factor that could set it up for a significant drop. Fortunately, the AI market is enormous, and other stocks appear to offer considerable growth potential. Hence, when looking for a stock to buy now, investors may earn higher returns by turning to a longtime Nvidia partner.\n\nInstead of Nvidia, look to a Nvidia partner\n\nInstead of Nvidia, investors may want to consider Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Supermicro -- as it is usually called -- is a hardware company, and building servers powered by Nvidia's AI chips has become a game changer, to say the least. Its stock has grown 4,500% over the last five years, a growth rate that outpaces the 3,100% return Nvidia earned during that time. SMCI Chart\n\nThis growth did not come fast. Supermicro came into existence in 1993. As a \"rack-scale total IT solutions provider,\" it has manufactured environmentally friendly equipment for cloud, enterprise, metaverse, IoT, and 5G-based solutions. Despite offering this equipment in more than 100 countries, Supermicro was relatively unknown for most of its existence.\n\nNonetheless, its AI equipment has taken Supermicro to the cutting edge of the IT industry, accounting for most of Supermicro's all-time gains. Although it had partnered with Nvidia for several years, its Nvidia-powered AI systems on the edge have offered faster data-center power and, by extension, more power to Supermicro stock.\n\nThe case for buying Supermicro, despite massive gains\n\nGiven the aforementioned massive gains, investors might assume they are discovering Supermicro too late. Indeed, another 4,500% increase is not likely over a five-year time frame, but buying it could still pay off for investors.\n\nIn the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), revenue came in at $9.6 billion, a 95% increase versus the same period in fiscal 2023. That led to a net income of $855 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, rising 92% as the cost of sales slightly outpaced revenue growth.\n\nAlso, despite its huge revenue increases, Supermicro does not see a slowdown in the immediate future. The company raised its fiscal 2024 guidance to the $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion range. That will amount to 110% yearly revenue growth at the midpoint, assuming the forecast holds.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore importantly, valuations are at reasonable levels when accounting for its considerable growth. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is only 49, below Nvidia at 75 times earnings.\n\nThe contrast is starker when measured by the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. Supermicro sells for only 4 times sales, a small fraction of Nvidia's 40 P/S ratio. Thus, when it comes to stock price growth potential, Supermicro should outpace its better-known partner over time.\n\nBuy Supermicro\n\nDespite past gains, Supermicro looks increasingly like the stock to own. Although it has already logged massive gains, the company appears positioned to maintain its growth rate for the foreseeable future.\n\nAlso, its considerable growth over the last five years does not appear to have fully incorporated into the stock price. With profit growth almost at triple-digit levels, a P/E ratio of under 50 amounts to a bargain, and its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is only a small fraction of Nvidia's, confirming that this is still a relatively inexpensive stock.\n\nThanks to that low valuation and continuing growth, investors can still earn outsized returns in what is now a proven growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: After Nvidia's Stock Split, These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies Could Be Next",
        "content": "Stock splits seem to be all the rage. After years of the step seeing less traction, 2024 already served up a slew of high-profile splits.\n\nThe biggest, no doubt, was Nvidia, the poster child of the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Some big names joined the split club, like the rapidly growing Broadcom.\n\nWhy split a stock? It helps open the door for smaller investors who are locked out of buying shares due to a steep price tag. On average, post-split stocks tend to perform well, but it's not a guarantee.\u00a0\u00a0 It could just be that splits tend to happen with stocks that already have positive momentum.\n\nYou might be curious, which company is next? I don't have a crystal ball, unfortunately, but here are my three picks for which companies it could be.\n\n1. Meta\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is emerging as one of the strongest AI plays. It has a massive amount of engaged daily users -- 3.2 billion by the company's count. This number is up 7% year over year\u00a0across its different platforms, which stand to benefit greatly from the tools the company collectively calls Meta AI.\n\nThe company saw its earnings per share (EPS) more than double last quarter, compared to the year before. This came with a nearly 30% jump in revenue and a huge bump in operating margin. The company also cut 10% of its staff this year.\n\nThis success drove its share price up 83% since last year. Now hovering above $500, it's the most expensive stock of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nMeta has never split its stock since it's been on the market. It seems ripe for a split.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) went on a tear this year with a year-to-date gain that would make Nvidia blush. The semiconductor company also designs and manufactures hardware critical for AI but arguably has a more diversified revenue stream than Nvidia.\n\nThe two actually work together. Supermicro uses Nvidia's chips in its data center servers.\n\nSupermicro has a lot of growth ahead. Of course, predicting the future is always difficult, but consensus estimates put the company's 2024 EPS growth at more than 100% from last year.\n\nSupermicro's shares are already expensive, trading near $900. If these estimates hold true, this company could easily be trading at a significantly higher price. It seems likely a split is coming for SMCI, as well.\n\n3. Netflix\n\nCalling Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) an AI company might be a stretch. They do make shows about AI -- if you haven't watched Black Mirror, please do -- but that hardly seems to qualify.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has actually employed AI for a while, or at least machine learning, the technology at the core of AI. Every large language model (LLM) you see on the market, like ChatGPT, is based on machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe algorithms Netflix employs learn what you like and what you don't. Based on this, they provide you recommendations. The more you use it, the better it gets. The company helped pioneer this feature that's now standard across all streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix leads the streaming pack with more than 260 million subscribers. That's a lot of eyeballs that make the service valuable. The company is capitalizing on this, instituting new programs to raise revenue. It seems to be working as consensus estimates put this year's earnings-per-share (EPS) growth at roughly 40% year over year.\n\nNetflix stock is trading at nearly $700. That's already at a level that could benefit from a stock split. That may well be what happens, but only time will tell.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Super Micro Computer Stock a Good Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "Enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI) has played a big role in pushing the markets higher so far this year. Although big tech stocks such as Nvidia and Microsoft have witnessed outsize buying activity, many investors have been looking at less obvious choices in hopes of identifying the next big AI opportunity.\n\nOne such company that has experienced its share of hype is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Shares of the AI darling are up 234% over the last year, and 218% just in 2024.\n\nWhile Supermicro has been closely affiliated with Nvidia, the underlying business is actually quite different -- and in my opinion, I think it's far less lucrative.\n\nLet's dig into the investment prospects of Supermicro and explore if the stock deserves a spot in your portfolio.\n\nSupermicro's business is soaring, but...\n\nPerhaps the hottest pocket of the AI realm is semiconductors. Demand is soaring for graphics processing units (GPUs) as generative AI applications continue to evolve.\n\nFor now, Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and some other chip designers have emerged as the biggest names in the GPU market. While Supermicro is works with many chip companies, it's not a semiconductor company itself.\n\nRather, Supermicro specializes in IT infrastructure. Essentially, the company designs architecture solutions such as storage clusters for high-performance GPUs.\n\nThe revenue trends seen below illustrate how the heightened demand and buying activity surrounding chips has served as a bellwether for Supermicro's services over the last couple of years.\n\nWhile the newfound revenue growth is encouraging, there are some lowlights investors should be aware of when it comes to Supermicro. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\n...there is more than meets the eye\n\nWhile rising demand can be considered a good thing for Supermicro, keep in mind that building IT infrastructure is an expensive business.\n\nTake a look at the dynamics in the charts below. In more recent quarters, Supermicro's capital expenditures (capex) have ballooned. The idea I'm trying to convey here is that while the company's revenue is surging, expenses are also rising significantly.\n\nThis dynamic is directly impacting Supermicro's margin profile. As observed below, Supermicro's gross margin is actually plateauing at the moment. SMCI Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAdmittedly, the financials analyzed above aren't necessarily a reason to run for the hills. However, there are a couple of other potential issues to explore as they relate to Supermicro.\n\nKeep in mind that the semiconductor space is a cyclical industry. Right now, chip businesses are enjoying a bit of a renaissance fueled by AI euphoria. But like any other type of business, eventually supply and demand trends will normalize.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat could spell trouble for Supermicro in the long run. It's pretty difficult to forecast demand for any product, let alone cutting-edge chips that are used for breakthrough applications in AI. Those themes have me concerned that Supermicro's business may witness a deceleration. This could further impact the company's profitability profile, which would be an unwelcome surprise given the already low-margin nature of the business. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs now a good time to buy Supermicro stock?\n\nWhile many investors have undoubtedly made a lot of money owning Supermicro stock, I'm skeptical that the returns were for the right reasons. I am suspicious that many investors see Supermicro as analogous to Nvidia and have poured into the stock accordingly. Therefore, when Nvidia and other chip stocks begin trading upwards, shares of Supermicro have followed. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe chart above benchmarks Supermicro against a peer set on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis. The obvious takeaway from the valuation trends above is that Supermicro is valued at a significant premium to its peers.\n\nHowever, a more subtle argument is that businesses such as Dell Technologies and International Business Machines in particular are not only much larger than Supermicro, but they are far more diversified when it comes to products and services. And yet Supermicro's P/E is more than double that of IBM and meaningfully higher than Dell's.\n\nConsidering the level of competition and the cyclicality of the chip space more broadly, mixed with the high capex and low-margin nature of Supermicro's business, I can't help but think the stock is overvalued.\n\nI think investors with a long-term horizon have better opportunities in the chip space and the AI arena in general. While scooping up Supermicro stock looks tempting, I see the company as more of trade and less of an investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Had a Super Massive 188% Gain in the 1st Half of 2024",
        "content": "Shares of computing company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) had a super, massive 188.2% gain in the first half of 2024, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. That's incredible enough. But by March, the stock was already up more than 300% year to date, which dwarfs its first-half returns by comparison.\n\nPut another way, Super Micro Computer stock is down more than 20% from its 2024 high. So, depending on when investors bought shares, they're either really happy or a little disappointed. SMCI Chart\n\nSuper Micro Computer's management gave a business update on Jan. 18 that got things rolling. And it followed it up with a positive financial report for its fiscal second quarter of 2024 on Jan. 29.\n\nBefore the year started, the company said that it would generate net sales of about $2.8 billion in Q2. But in January's update, management said it would have Q2 net sales of at least $3.6 billion. It ultimately wound up with net sales of $3.65 billion -- the magnitude of this outperformance is unbelievable.\n\nFor perspective, Super Micro Computer's Q2 net sales were up 103% year over year and roughly 30% ahead of its original guidance for the quarter. The company's products are in hot demand right now because they're useful for building infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWith booming sales, Super Micro Computer's profits are also soaring. In Q2, it had earnings per share (EPS) of $5.10, which were up 62% from the prior-year period.\n\nLooking at the sales boom and the profitability, S&P Global decided to add Super Micro Computer to the S&P 500 on March 1. This was another catalyst for the stock. It became effective on March 18, which is about when the stock peaked.\n\nWhy did Super Micro Computer stock slip?\n\nGrowth continued accelerating for Super Micro Computer in its fiscal third quarter of 2024 as well. On April 30, the company reported Q3 net sales of $3.85 billion, which were up 200% year over year. But believe it or not, too much growth can have its challenges.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's growth has been so sudden and intense that there are some cash-flow issues. On March 19, the company decided to do a secondary stock offering to raise money to build inventory and expand manufacturing. This is after it raised $1.5 billion in February by issuing convertible notes.\n\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing. But offering shares did cause it to slip from highs.\n\nWhat now?\n\nFor the year, Super Micro Computer expects net sales of at least $14.7 billion -- more than double its net sales in fiscal 2023. Clearly demand remains for its products.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow long will demand last? Given that it's building up the business now with its new cash, Super Micro Computer believes things are just getting started. If management is right, there could be more good times ahead for shareholders, even if it's not quite as good as the first half of 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Buying a stock is very easy but picking the right stock is tough. As we embark on the second half of the year, it is time to reevaluate your stock investment portfolio. The first half has been incredible for several stocks as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 steadily hit new highs and now is the time to look for ideal second-half stocks. Having dealt with market uncertainty, war, and high inflation, the market turned in an incredible performance in the first half.\n\nSeveral stocks hit 52-week highs in the first half and I believe the upward rally will continue this year. A Fed rate cut could also boost the market further and take stocks higher. If you want to make the most of this upside, here are three powerhouse stocks that can dominate the second half of the year. Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) An Nvidia (NVDA) semiconductor chip on a black background.\n\nSource: Hairem / Shutterstock.com\n\nA giant tech stock, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an industry darling that has proved its strength time and again. Investors who bought Nvidia in 2021 are enjoying massive gains today and if you missed that chance, the recent stock split is a good opportunity for you to accumulate the stock. Nvidia\u2019s rally isn\u2019t over yet and the upcoming quarterly results could give the stock another strong push.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMultiple catalysts are working for Nvidia. There was a time when it generated\u00a0the majority\u00a0of its revenue from the gaming segment but this has changed today. It is an artificial intelligence (AI) leader with a strong market share. No competitor has been able to come close to Nvidia\u2019s glory and it is making the most of the imbalance between the demand and supply of AI chips.\n\nThe company launched the\u00a0Blackwell platform which could drive growth in the current quarter. Its GPU architecture comes with six technologies that ensure accelerated computing. It is set to replace the H100 chip later this year and could deliver solid gains and higher revenue growth for the industry darling.\n\nUBS analyst believes the stock could hit $150 per share citing a robust demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips. Nvidia is one stock that has dominated throughout the first half of the year and is set to continue doing the same in the second half.\n\nTrading at $131 today, Nvidia could see a strong momentum when it reports the second-quarter results next month.\n\nSuper Micro Computers (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince we are all obsessed with Nvidia, it makes sense to look out for a company that benefits every time Nvidia grows. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI)\u00a0has exposure to AI and it specializes in equipment for data centers. The massive demand for its products has given a strong boost to the stock which is up 213% YTD and exchanging hands for $895.\n\nStory continues\n\nData centers have become an important aspect of AI and SMCI is set to benefit here. Whenever Nvidia reports impressive quarterly numbers, SMCI soars. However, this does not mean that its fundamentals aren\u2019t\u00a0impressive. The company saw net sales of $3.85 billion and a net income of $402 million in the\u00a0third quarter. For the fourth quarter, it\u00a0is aiming\u00a0for sales in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion.\n\nThe close ties with Nvidia help the business move. Whenever Nvidia launches a new chip, SMCI will integrate\u00a0the same into its products. The company can build new systems efficiently and quickly, catering to rising demand. It is working on expanding manufacturing and has invested in a\u00a0new facility in Malaysia which will\u00a0help increase the revenue capacity to $20 billion.\n\nIf the management decides to follow the footsteps of Nvidia, the stock will be an ideal candidate for a stock split. Considering the soaring stock price, investors might be discouraged to invest and this could lead to a stock split.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn unstoppable stock, streaming giant Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) is up 65% YTD and is trading for $311 today. The stock could be on an incredible rally in the second half with over 239 million premium global subscribers. A dominant player in the industry, Spotify offers a free plan and a premium version for users.\n\nFundamentally, Spotify is only getting stronger with a\u00a020% YOY jump in revenue and an impressive 184% YOY jump in EPS to 97 cents per share. The company is steadily working on global expansions and building a strong content library\u00a0that will\u00a0drive users. It has adequate cash flow to pursue expansion plans and invest in the platform to improve user experience.\n\nThe company has set itself apart by investing in some\u00a0of the\u00a0popular podcasts that draw listeners to the platform. It holds the second place in the\u00a0global audiobook segment and has more than 375,000 titles.\n\nIt is also investing in AI to improve the platform and this investment will pay off in the coming years. Its new feature called\u00a0AI DJ will create unique playlists for the listener based on their preferences. Besides AI, it is working on features that help improve user engagement and has ended the first quarter with 615 million monthly active users.\n\n18 analysts on\u00a0TipRanks have a buy rating with a price target of $355.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

By increasing sales and acquiring new customers, companies become stronger and eventually, with enough growth, becomes a leader in their industries.\n\nI\u2019ve selected several A-rated growth stocks to review, based on their outstanding overall grades in the Portfolio Grader. The Portfolio Grader considers a variety of factors, including growth, earnings performance, analyst sentiment and momentum. So, A-rated stocks are the strongest overall companies in the market.\n\nBut what makes these A-rated growth stocks stand out today is that all the companies we\u2019re going to consider also get either an \u201cA\u201d or a \u201cB\u201d grade in the Portfolio Grader for growth.\n\nYou can expect each of these A-rated growth stocks to continue to perform, because the companies they represent are successfully expanding \u2013 and you can see it in the bottom line.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) may be the most compelling stock in the market. As the maker of powerful graphics processing units that are used to power top-line artificial intelligence programs, Nvidia stock soared to previously unimaginable heights. The stock is up 220% over the last 12 months and 170% so far this year.\n\nBut interestingly, Nvidia seems to be on a bit of a break. Since June 18, the stock is up only 3%, raising concerns from some nervous investors that we may finally be nearing a top.\n\nNonsense.\n\nI think it\u2019s more likely that this is just part of the Wall Street summer doldrums \u2013 when the market sees less activity from Memorial Day to Labor day. But remember that Nvidia\u2019s next earnings release is scheduled for Aug. 21, so this hiatus will surely come to an end sooner rather than later.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdjusted earnings for Nvidia were up 461% in the most recently reported quarter. And since earnings are far outpacing the stock\u2019s growth, Nvidia stock is getting cheaper every day on a valuation basis, which makes it among the A-rated growth stocks you need in your portfolio.\n\nNVDA stock gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for both growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo. It\u2019s responsible for the Chome search engine and Android smartphones. Alphabet is a powerhouse that\u2019s taken its rightful place, as has Nvidia, as a Magnificent 7 stock.\n\nSo then, why is the CEO selling shares?\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly sold\u00a022,500 Alphabet shares\u00a0on June 20, raising some investor eyebrows. I wrote about it recently for InvestorPlace, and as I said then, Pichai still has 227,000 shares of GOOG stock, so I\u2019m not concerned at all. In fact, this is more of a position-trimming move than anything else.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be bullish about Alphabet, including its massive position in internet search and the dominance of the Chrome browser. Alphabet brought in $80.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 15% from a year ago. Its operating income was up 32% to $25.4 billion.\n\nGOOG stock is up 36% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and an \u201cA\u201d overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is the third and last Magnificent 7 stock we\u2019ll talk about today. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the operator of the powerful social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Reels.\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerburg and friends at Harvard University, Meta is powerful because it encourages users to connect with friends and family and make new connections.\n\nPeople who use Facebook and Instagram willingly share their likes and dislikes, where they\u2019ve been and what they plan to do \u2013 and that\u2019s all information that Meta can use to sell to advertisers.\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 advertising platforms are powerful, there\u2019s no doubt. With all the personal information in Meta\u2019s databases, advertisers can make extremely targeted advertising campaigns.\n\nThat\u2019s why Meta brought in $36.4 billion in advertising revenue in the first quarter, making up roughly 98% of its total revenue. Advertising dollars were up 23% from a year ago, making this one of the A-rated growth stocks to keep your eyes on.\n\nI\u2019m expecting that trend to continue and META stock to pop again when the company reports earnings on July 31. For now, Meta stock is up 51% in 2024, and its gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not too often you see a company with a 50-to-1 stock split, as Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) executed this summer. But I like it because it\u2019s a sign of management that is very deliberate in its actions.\n\nChipotle stock topped $3,200 per share \u2013 an enormous number \u2013 before its June 25 split, making it one of the biggest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe split makes the stock more accessible and attractive to retail investors as well as employees who want to participate in the company\u2019s stock purchase plan \u2013 it was a good move all around.\n\nI also see the move as part of the company\u2019s culture. Remember, this is a restaurant stock with more than 3,400 locations, but no franchises. Chipotle maintains ownership of every location because it\u2019s the only way it can ensure company quality and standards.\n\nChipotle also famously doesn\u2019t have any freezers in its locations, which means that the ingredients for its burritos, salads and burrito bowls must always be made fresh.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up 14.1% from a year ago. Comparable restaurant sales were up 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%. The company is reporting second-quarter earnings on July 24.\n\nCMG stock is up 27% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and an \u201cA\u201d overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) isn\u2019t part of the Magnificent 7. But if the list ever expands to eight or 10 stocks, it might be difficult to keep Supermicro off the list.\n\nSupermicro makes the server infrastructure that is needed by companies that are buying up all the Nvidia GPUs to build large language models and other generative AI products. Supermicro can provide custom server architecture solutions to bundle those GPUs and allow them to work together.\n\nSupermicro is reportedly providing and assembling half of the racks AI-supercomputer racks that xAI, the artificial intelligence startup operated by Elon Musk, is creating to develop an AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\n\nThe company is seeing massive growth, with sales of $3.85 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $1.28 billion a year ago. Net income of $402 million was up from $86 million a year ago.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s another SMCI catalyst next week. Typically, Supermicro pre-announces between 18 and 24 days after the end of the quarter, so that could be as early as next week. Should the company provide evidence of another blowout quarter and/or dazzling guidance, SMCI stock will surely jump.\n\nSMCI stock is up 216% in 2024. It gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a computer security company that uses AI and machine learning to stop threats in real time. Its cloud-native platform that provides endpoint protection, cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform is its primary product, but CrowdStrike also offers modules that companies can use to customize their products.\n\nThe modules, which include things like endpoint security, data security, IT operations, threat intelligence and more, serves as a successful business plan because customers can always start small and add on as they go.\n\nCrowdStrike says 65% of its customers purchase and use at least five modules. Revenue for the company\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $921 million, up 33% from a year ago. Subscription revenue was $872.2 million, up 34% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nIt also got a boost last month when CWRD stock was added to the S&P 500, which means that exchange-traded funds and other products that track the index are buying CRWD stock.\n\nCrowdStrike stock is up 47% this year. It gets \u201cA\u201d rating for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was famously one of the original FAANG stocks that were considered market darlings before the rise of AI and the Magnificent 7. But Netflix, which is the premiere streaming service, hasn\u2019t really gone away.\n\nIn fact, the stock has only gotten better.\n\nNetflix management made a huge decision when it ended its free password sharing program. Before, the company all but encouraged the practice and password sharing was common between friends, family and partners was common.\n\nBut the company finally acknowledged that it was leaving a lot of money on the table, so the program came to an end. Netflix instituted an $8 monthly charge to any account that was sharing a password with someone outside the physical household. And now paid memberships are up from 232.6 million a year ago to 269.6 million in the last quarter.\n\nRevenue also grew \u2013 up 14.8% to $9.3 billion, and the stock returned to levels not seen since 2015.\n\nNFLX stock is up 39% this year, and gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had LONG position(s) in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.\u00a0Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had LONG positions in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.

        "title": "7 Solid Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "The 2020s have been a rollercoaster so far, and who knows what the next ten years could hold for us. However, if we narrow the lens down to just the stock market, it\u2019s been nothing but stellar for the past year and a half.\n\nAlso, the coming years look rosy, at least according to the bulls. Most bulls argue that we already had a soft landing and that the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cuts will give the pandemic\u2019s ripple effects a happy ending.\n\nBears will tell you to hunker down in defensive names or even flee. They see the writing on the wall for growth stocks. In their view, a repeat of the Dot-Com Bust is inevitable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere\u2019s some truth to both sides since the labor market is strong, and artificial intelligence (AI) is contributing to efficiency. On the other hand, rate cuts have aligned with previous recessions.\n\nRegardless, growth stocks are unlikely to disappoint you if you hold them for a decade. They may take a hit in the near term if we enter a recession. However, history has shown that it\u2019s not worth timing the market, and it\u2019s much better to buy and hold. Thus, let\u2019s explore seven solid growth stocks to buy and hold for the next decade.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) still has significant room to run, with its international app Temu taking the America by storm. It was the most downloaded app since Q1 of 2023 and now boasts over 100 million active users in the U.S. alone. With its ultra-low prices, Temu is unlikely to turn away cost-conscious consumers anytime soon.\n\nHowever, Temu is just one growth engine for PDD. The company\u2019s core Pinduoduo app continues to thrive in China. Analysts are incredibly bullish. PDD stock price targets\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nRecently, PDD upgraded their 2024 revenue and earnings estimates. Despite having much stronger fundamentals, the stock trades at just 12 times forward earnings, nearly a 50% discount to the Nasdaq 100.\n\nOf course, risks are possible. Escalating U.S.-China tensions and potential tariffs could create headwinds. However, with a foothold in the massive Chinese market and an expanding global presence, I believe PDD is well-positioned for the long haul.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is riding the AI wave, and investors are taking notice. The company reported blowout earnings last quarter, with revenue surging 200% year-over-year (YOY) to $3.85 billion. Net income skyrocketed 367% to $402.5 million. This growth is driven not only by AI but also by advanced technologies like cloud computing and edge computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Super Micro Computer is among the most promising and profitable AI plays for early investors. The stock has more than tripled year-to-date (YTD). SMCI is a key beneficiary of the AI boom as a critical server technology supplier to data centers. Some analysts even view it as an \u2018AI proxy\u2019 that could attract investors if enthusiasm for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) starts to wane.\n\nDespite the huge run-up, the stock still appears cheap compared to high-flying software names. Super Micro Computer trades at 38 times forward earnings, a bargain considering its triple-digit growth. Of course, the data center industry is cyclical and competitive, so growth projections are more uncertain. But if the AI megatrend has legs, as I believe it does, Super Micro Computer could be a core holding for the next decade-plus.\n\nWall Street is largely bullish, with a consensus price target of $1,066. Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Wedbush all have targets around $830-$890. However, some analysts caution the stock is priced for perfection after the massive rally.\n\nTherefore, Super Micro Computer will likely continue to be a battleground stock. But given its pole position in the AI hardware race, it\u2019s definitely worth having some exposure to.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is riding high on the cloud computing and data boom megatrends. Recently, the company reported stellar Q1 of 2024 results, with revenue up 27% YOY to $611 million. Also, Datadog is seeing strong growth in large customers, with those spending over $100,000 annually increasing 15% to about 3,340.\n\nWhile most of the AI hype is focused on hardware players like Nvidia, Datadog provides exposure to AI software trends without investing in risky startups or just the Big Tech giants.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on Datadog. Morgan Stanley reiterated an overweight rating, citing the company\u2019s ability to gain market share and deliver attractive profit margins. The stock has surged over 20% in the year, though at a $42 billion market cap, Datadog trades at a steep valuation.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m optimistic about Datadog\u2019s prospects. Exercise some caution though, given the lofty expectations baked into the stock price. However, as long as organizations continue rapidly adopting cloud computing, Datadog is poised to be a prime beneficiary.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is riding several powerful megatrends that could position the company for future robust growth. In Q1 of 2024, Duolingo delivered impressive results, with revenue increasing 45% YOY to $167.6 million and adjusted EBITDA nearly tripling. This beat expectations, though the stock still dropped 15% after the report.\n\nI\u2019m optimistic about Duolingo\u2019s prospects. Globalization and widespread internet access are fueling people\u2019s desire to learn about different cultures and connect with the world. Nowhere is this more evident than in developed countries. At the same time, high levels of immigration into the U.S. and Western nations are driving demand for language learning software. In Sweden, for instance, Duolingo has become the go-to place for migrants learning Swedish.\n\nAs these trends accelerate, the global language-learning market is projected to reach $115 billion by 2025. It currently has less than 1% market share, so Duolingo has a massive runway for growth. Analysts seem to agree, with the average rating on the stock at moderate buy.\n\nIn addition, Duolingo\u2019s fundamentals look solid. Daily active users jumped 54% last quarter as the product resonates with learners. Revenue from subscriptions are also compounding fast. growth stocks to buy and hold: DUOL subscription revenue\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith a powerful flywheel effect of product improvements fueling user growth and vice versa, expect Duolingo to sustain its momentum.\n\nBandwidth Inc (BAND) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCommunications platform company Bandwidth Inc (NASDAQ:BAND) could be poised for a major recovery in the coming years. The company reported impressive first-quarter 2024 results, with revenue increasing 24% YOY to $171 million. Moreover, management raised their full-year outlook, now expecting $715 million in revenue at the midpoint. Analysts expect its financials to rise sharply in the coming years. BAND financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nBandwidth Inc. is still unprofitable on a GAAP basis and is saddled with a hefty $643.8 million debt load. Nevertheless, I see plenty of reasons for optimism. The company is riding several powerful megatrends in the CPaaS (communications platform as a service) market, which is projected to soar from $12.5 billion in 2022 to $45.3 billion by 2027.\n\nGranted, this is a speculative pick for now. The stock has been hammered, plunging from a peak of nearly $190 in 2021 to about $10 last year, though shares have rebounded to $18 as of writing.\n\nOnce the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, Bandwidth\u2019s growth will really start to shine through to the bottom line. It has $147 million in cash and can handle the losses until rates come down and take off the interest expense burden. It\u2019s worth looking into if you like risk.\n\nPaycom Software (PAYC)\n\nSource: STEFANY LUNA DE LINZY / Shutterstock.com\n\nPaycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) has been on my radar lately, and for good reason.\n\nDespite the stock being down 58.6% over the past year, the company continues to post impressive double-digit revenue growth and rising profits. In their recent Q1 of 2024 earnings report, PAYC delivered revenue of $500 million, up 11% YOY, and adjusted EBITDA of $230 million. While growth has slowed compared to historical levels, I believe the market is underestimating Paycom Software\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nPAYC\u2019s software named Beti allows employees to do their own payroll, and the company is streamlining HR workflows and driving significant ROI for clients. As more businesses rush automation and self-service, expect demand for Paycom\u2019s offerings to accelerate.\n\nAdmittedly, analyst opinions on PAYC are mixed, but it is a good buy at current valuations.\n\nBlock Inc. (SQ) The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe market has been far too pessimistic on BlockInc. (NYSE:SQ). While the stock is still well off its highs, the fundamentals paint a picture of a company firing on all cylinders. Block Inc. is capitalizing on major fintech megatrends such as digital payments, e-commerce and crypto. Cash App continues to be a growth engine, with inflows per active up 11% in Q1. And the Afterpay acquisition is already bearing fruit, as evidenced by the 25% increase in BNPL gross merchandise value.\n\nIts Q1 of 2024 earnings report beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue is up 19.4% YOY to nearly $6 billion, while EPS of 85 cents trounced estimates by 12 cents.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish, with 24 buy ratings versus just one sell. The consensus price target of $89 implies nearly 40% upside from current levels. It\u2019s not hard to see why, considering EPS is projected to quadruple over the next decade while revenue could double from 2024 to 2030. SQ financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAs long as Block Inc. keeps executing, I expect the stock to make a sharp move higher, especially once interest rates start coming down.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Over the last five years, Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) has experienced exponential growth, fueled by the skyrocketing demand for advanced artificial intelligence rack-scale direct liquid cooling systems, enhancing the performance and efficiency of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) technologies.\n\nAs a core technology player in the AI revolution, Super Micro Computer is building its leadership position across this burgeoning market.\n\nSuper Micro Computer surges with 600% earnings boost, projects $5.5 billion in revenue amid AI boom\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with SMCI.\n\nIn the past five years, earnings have grown by more than 600% and reached a record high of $600 million in its fiscal third quarter of 2023. Therefore, it will be well positioned to deliver strong growth in earnings and revenue for the better part of the year, riding on record settings in demand for AI rack scale direct liquid cooling systems. The high demand for products from Nvidia, Intel and AMD were the key drivers of the company's projected fourth-quarter revenue increase by 133% to 152% to between $5.10 billion and $5.50 billion.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is strategically positioned at the forefront of a technological revolution, carving out a significant niche within the burgeoning AI market. As demand for AI capabilities skyrockets across various industries, the company's advanced liquid cooling solutions and its strategic positioning in the server and data center sector should allow it to capitalize on a market poised to grow to $430 billion by 2033.\n\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2023, Super Micro Computer reported a staggering 200% increase in revenue, totaling $3.85 billion, up from less than $2 billion in 2021. This explosive growth underscores the company's robust response to increasing demand for data processing capabilities. The company, primarily generating revenue through its servers and storage systems designed for data centers, has successfully tapped into the critical needs of modern computingspeed, efficiency and high-capacity processing. These systems support AI applications, cloud computing and edge computing, which are crucial for handling extensive data operations. A Look at AI Powerhouse Super Micro Computer\n\nSource: Super Micro Computer presentation\n\nLeading the way with cutting-edge AI and liquid cooling innovations\n\nSuper Micro Computer has utilized advanced technologies from industry leaders like Nvidia, Intel and AMD. It has also used these in its server products, thus making its technological innovation very exciting. Such integration has improved its server products and positioned them accordingly with global technological changes like Nvidia's Blackwell architecture.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch collaborations have strengthened the market position of Super Micro Computer and given traction to its revenue streams with product offerings like AI rack-scale DLC systems. These are some of the most critical elements that make for data center thermal load management and have witnessed record demand in the face of efficiency and increasing processing demands of AI tasks.\n\nAdditionally, the financial results point to the stability and growth potential of the company to the fullest extent. Net income for Super Micro Computer in the third quarter surged 367% year over year to $402 million, with earnings per share jumping from $1.63 to $6.65. This could not have resulted from revenue growth, but more from strategic business operations and cost management.\n\nFinally, like any other technology company, Super Micro Computer could be threatened by economic cycles and heavy competition. However, specialization in hot niches like AI cooling solutions and customized server products protects the former from these disturbances. Thus, continuous innovation and flexibility to adjust according to market demand opens new opportunities for further expansion.\n\nSuper Micro unveils game-changing liquid-cooled AI data center solutions with Nvidia partnership\n\nThe total IT solution provider for AI, cloud storage and 5G technology has also reiterated its commitment to creating a ready-to-deploy liquid-cooled AI data center for cloud-native solutions. The new DLC solution is designed to accelerate generative AI adoption for enterprises across various industries as it is optimized for the Nvidia AI Enterprise software platform.\n\nThe unveiling of the new data center cooling system is part of the company's push to provide solutions that can reduce energy requirements. Super Micro Computer is closely working with Nvidia to enhance the development of data centers that ensure seamless and flexible transition of AI applications from production to deployment.\n\nThe company also inked a strategic partnership with Data Section and Foxconn (TPE:2354) to develop a rack-scale liquid-cooled solution for new data centers that leverage advanced Nvidia GPUs. The new system will support advanced AI enterprise systems while delivering robust performance and generative AI applications.\n\nFinally, according to financial advisor Steven Kibbel, Super Micro Computer's advanced liquid cooling technology enables closer GPU placement for high-demand AI tasks, enhancing data center efficiency by up to 40% and reducing environmental impact. With pre-built racks for rapid AI system deployment, the company supports global AI demand through projects like Japan's AI center, advancing AI technology and maintaining a competitive edge in image generation and high-speed computing. This progress is underscored by impressive growth figures and strategic partnerships that drive demand in the global server market.

In contrast, Nvidia, one of the industry's big players and a poster child of the AI trend in the semiconductor space, is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 46.\n\nWhile lower than the average earnings multiple of 30 for the Nasdaq 100, the price-earnings ratio is reasonable for a profitable company growing at an impressive rate. Additionally, there is a tremendous opportunity for growth given the artificial intelligence story is just starting, with the market expected to balloon to over $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nManagement believes Super Micro Computer has what it takes to reach $25 billion in recurring revenue across all its product lines over the next five years. The race to $25 billion in annual revenue is part of the company's strategy that focuses on enhancing the development of IT rack solutions powered by some of the most sought-after GPUS and CPUs from Nvidia and Intel. The company is also accelerating the development of liquid cooling infrastructure solutions, which should support the growing demand for data centers to host AI applications.\n\nWhile the current 12-month trailing revenue is $11.8 billion, management expects the company to grow at a compound annual rate of 16%, which is achievable. Considering the current gross profit margin of 15%, the company would quickly generate earnings of up to $1.70 billion. Earnings of more than $1.50 billion would significantly dwarf the current price-earnings multiple of 23 that investors must pay for the stock, considering the company generated $673 million in net income in fiscal 2023. A Look at AI Powerhouse Super Micro Computer\n\nSource: Super Micro Computer presentation\n\nBottom line\n\nEven though Super Micro Computer's stock has exploded by over 190% year to date, there is still room for more gains, given the strong demand for the company's AI server solution products. Increasing demand for power and cooling as data centers struggle with mounting AI tasks should present significant growth opportunities for the company.\n\nTherefore, the stock is currently trading at a discount compared to its peers. Further, factoring in the robust revenue and earnings growth rates as the artificial intelligence opportunity in the server market explodes, the stock remains a solid buy despite additional market pullbacks.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Are you interested in AI but don\u2019t know where to start? I can\u2019t blame you. Researching artificial intelligence stocks can be overwhelming. To cut through the noise, I prefer to look to the analysts who share their insight on certain assets through ratings. This gives us an easier way to identify quality stocks, with an indication of how high they could go.\n\nRatings help investors make a qualitative, apples-to-apples comparison of stocks.\u00a0Analysts rate stocks on a scale of strong sell and rise to a sell, hold, buy, with strong buy being the highest. Naturally, those with strong buy ratings are considered the cream of the crop.\n\nHowever, ratings aren\u2019t everything. Investors should still err on the side of caution and conduct their due diligence, as highly rated artificial intelligence stocks don\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019s a sure winner. Ratings are just a piece of the puzzle that can complement your stock selection process. But they are a good place to start.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, today, I will look at three buy-rated AI stocks with great potential. To get my list, I screened the market and used the following criteria below:\n\nA strong buy rating from analysts, Positive earnings and revenue YOY growth, and Potential upsides exceeding 40%.\n\nI sorted the list based on the highest to lowest potential upside based on analysts\u2019 high target prices. So, let\u2019s start with:\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe market has high hopes for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) as the adoption of AI continues. As a long-standing partner of Nvidia and specializing in AI servers, the company is standing at the forefront of the current AI boom alongside other tech giants.\n\nSMCI recently announced it will add three new manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley, anticipating further growth in the sector.\n\nFor FY\u201923, the company reported impressive revenue growth, up 37% to $7.12 billion against FY\u201922\u2019s $5.20 billion. Meanwhile, net income per diluted share doubled from $5.32 to $11.43. This massive improvement \u201cvalidates our global leadership position in AI-accelerated compute platforms,\u201d says Charles Liang, President and CEO. The FY\u201924 report will soon be released as investors eagerly anticipate the results.\n\nSMCI stock has a strong buy rating based on 8 analysts. Its high target price of $1,500 represents a massive 77% potential upside. Truly, SMCI is well-positioned to become one of the fastest-growing artificial intelligence stocks today.\n\nQuickLogic Corporation (QUIK) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the leading providers of open reconfigurable computing solutions, QuickLogic Corporation (NASDAQ:QUIK) specializes in fabless semiconductor manufacturing for ultra-low powered semiconductors.\n\nThe company has continued to announce major catalysts that help drive positive sentiments from investors, including its partnership with Zero-Error Systems America for space applications, the Aurora 2.6 eFPGA User Tool Suite release, and a six-figure license agreement for subsidiary SensiML.\n\nQuickLogic reported 31% YOY revenue growth in FY\u201923. The report also outlined 146% total revenue growth across three years from 2020, when it launched its IP business model. While the year ended in a 2-cent loss, it is still a vast improvement from FY\u201922\u2019s 34-cent loss per share.\n\nThe company\u2019s upward trajectory spells potential reversal in the future, a sentiment expressed by CEO Brian Faith.\u00a0\u201cWith the expansion of our customer base and end markets that we anticipate this year,\u201d Faith says, \u201cwe expect our growth trend and profitability to continue in 2024 and beyond.\u201d\n\nThis optimism further cements the strong buy rating from analysts, which outlines a 56% potential upside based on the current high target price of $16.\n\nLattice Semiconductor Corporation (LSCC) AI.

Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBeing at the forefront of low-power FPGA (field programmable gate array) solutions development has made Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:LSCC) the leader in the field.\n\nThe company has focused on solutions that cater to \u201cbig data,\u201d like cloud computing edge and artificial intelligence. Recently, it announced new products that cater to the evolving security needs of the market, like the MachXO5D\u2122-NX secure control FPGAs. In addition, Lattice has also shared its 3D sensor fusion reference design, which aims to help develop autonomous applications.\n\nLattice Semiconductor\u2019s revenue was up an impressive 11.6% in FY\u201923 despite \u201cnear-term cyclical headwinds,\u201d said CEO and President Jim Anderson. Meanwhile, net income increased by 44.8% YOY.\n\nThis excellent performance mirrors Wall Street\u2019s strong buy rating for LSCC stock.

        "content": "The stock market has shown remarkable resilience in the first half of 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting record highs despite economic uncertainty. Chipmakers and AI-related companies have been standout market-beating stocks. Meanwhile, other sectors like technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary are also driving much of the index\u2019s gains.\n\nHere are seven market-beating stocks that have high growth potential and are starting to outperform the stock market and still have room to run higher.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been on a tear lately. Most growth investors are kicking themselves for not buying shares sooner. The stock has tripled year-to-date, recently hitting fresh highs above $900.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSMCI is riding major tailwinds from the AI boom. It produces critical server technology, and partners closely with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to power data centers. Some analysts even view Super Micro as an \u201cAI proxy\u201d that could attract investors if enthusiasm for Nvidia starts to wane.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials look stellar too, with revenue surging over 200% last quarter. And I don\u2019t see this slowing down anytime soon. Super Micro has its finger on the pulse of several key megatrends like cloud computing, AI and data centers that should provide a long growth runway.\n\nSure, the stock isn\u2019t cheap at 38 times forward earnings, but I think that\u2019s more than justified, given the explosive growth. A few analysts have lofty price targets of up to $1,500. Of course, there are risks, but all things considered I\u2019m very bullish.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor powerhouse that provides chips for a wide range of applications. The company\u2019s stock has surged over 21% in the past month alone and nearly doubled over the past year.\n\nBroadcom recently posted a strong earnings beat primarily driven by insatiable demand for its AI-focused chips. Management is now forecasting $11 billion in AI-related revenue for the full year. Thus, Broadcom is now one of the market-beating stocks for investors looking to ride the AI megatrend alongside Nvidia.\n\nWhile the analyst community is largely bullish, with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus and a flurry of price target hikes, I do have some reservations about Broadcom\u2019s lofty valuation. The stock is priced for perfection with a forward P/E ratio pushing 37x.\n\nSo, where do I stand? I believe Broadcom\u2019s strong positioning in AI and cloud computing can power robust growth ahead. As long as the AI hype stays, AVGO should outperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the company behind the current AI rally, as it initially made large investments into OpenAI. It also has productivity tools that the white-collar sector cannot survive without. It is hard to find a single tech field in which this company is not, or has not, competed.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s Azure cloud platform is rapidly gaining ground on market leader Amazon Web Services. Azure gained 31% market share last quarter thanks in large part to surging demand for AI services. Microsoft\u2019s close partnership with OpenAI and its Copilot AI offerings are also fueling excitement. Nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 already using Copilot.\n\nAnalysts are largely bullish, with Piper Sandler recently reiterating a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and $465 price target on the stock. However, some caution Microsoft\u2019s valuation is getting stretched, with the average analyst price target implying just 7% upside from current levels.\n\nNonetheless, I believe Microsoft\u2019s strong positioning in AI, cloud and other growth markets should continue to propel shares higher. The company\u2019s ability to drive synergies across its sprawling product portfolio is a key competitive advantage that the market still underappreciates.\n\nHEICO Corporation (HEI) The website for Heico is shown with a magnifying glass enlarging the company's logo.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nHEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI) has been riding high lately, and I believe the aerospace and defense powerhouse is well-positioned to continue its impressive run. The company recently reported stellar Q2 2024 results. Earnings per share of 88 cents handily beat estimates by 8 cents. And, revenue soared 39% year-over-year to $955 million. The Flight Support Group has been the key driver of this growth. market-beating stocks: HEI FSG segment\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHEICO is benefiting from several powerful megatrends in its core markets. Air travel demand has come roaring back post-pandemic. This has driven strong sales of HEICO\u2019s cost-saving aftermarket parts to airlines looking to keep aging fleets flying. The company is also seeing robust growth in its defense business as geopolitical tensions and the war in Ukraine spur higher military spending globally.\n\nAnalysts are taking notice of HEICO\u2019s momentum. In recent months, the stock has scored a slew of price target hikes from top firms like Bank of America, Truist, and RBC Capital. While HEICO shares don\u2019t come cheap at 64 times forward earnings, I believe the premium valuation is justified given the company\u2019s exceptional growth profile, high-margin business model, and significant runway in both commercial aerospace and defense.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has faced its share of challenges, from losing market share in desktop CPUs to AMD to delays in getting its AI chips to market. But there are also some promising tailwinds that could help turn things around.\n\nFor one, Intel is getting a major boost from the U.S. government to the tune of $8.5 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act to bolster its AI capabilities. That\u2019s a huge vote of confidence. Intel is also generating buzz with its upcoming Lunar Lake chip, which is supposed to deliver big performance gains for AI workloads in laptops. Analysts at Melius Research even predict Intel could be poised for a second-half rebound as an \u201cAI laggard\u201d that\u2019s ready to play catch-up.\n\nIf Intel can execute on its product roadmap, ride the coattails of the generative AI megatrend, and make the most of its government support, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the stock surprise to the upside. It\u2019s a high-risk, high-reward bet, but one that I believe could pay off for patient investors willing to look past the near-term noise.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) has been riding high, and I\u2019m quite bullish on the stock. The drone and missile maker reported stellar Q4 results that blew past expectations, with earnings of 43 cents per share crushing estimates. Revenue also hit a record $197 million. Looking ahead, AeroVironment sees clear skies, guiding for nearly 12% top-line growth in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe company is benefiting from soaring demand for its cutting-edge drone tech, especially its Switchblade loitering munitions that have proven highly effective on the battlefield. With rising geopolitical tensions, military spending should provide a nice tailwind. UnCrewed and Loitering Munitions segments have seen exceptional growth. AVAV UnCrewed Systems sales chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com AVAV Loitering Munitions sales chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThat said, not everyone is sold. Some analysts argue the impressive headline numbers mask underlying concerns about profitability. Shares dipped nearly 4% after the report.\n\nRegardless, the Street is getting more optimistic, with earnings upgrades and price target hikes. Given AeroVironment\u2019s strong positioning in the fast-growing drone space and ability to outpace the broader industry, I think the long-term trajectory remains positive. This is one of the market-beating stocks that is worth keeping on your radar.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been aggressively pushing into AI, but not everyone on Wall Street is convinced just yet. The creative software giant recently posted solid Q2 2024 earnings that beat expectations, driven by strong growth in its Digital Media segment. Adobe is betting big that AI will expand its addressable market with innovations like its Firefly generative AI and new AI-powered tools for Photoshop, Acrobat and more.\n\nHowever, despite the recent spike, the stock is still down by 2% year-to-date. There are worries about rising competition from rivals like Canva and Microsoft in the generative AI space. Some analysts have also expressed skepticism about how quickly Adobe can monetize its AI investments. Citi warned that consensus estimates for the second half look \u201csomewhat aggressive.\u201d\n\nThat said, I remain optimistic about Adobe\u2019s long-term prospects. The shift to digital creativity and marketing shows no signs of slowing. Adobe\u2019s entrenched market position and strong brand give it a major advantage as it races to infuse AI across its product suite. Recent partner enthusiasm around offerings like GenStudio and Firefly Services is also encouraging. While the stock may stay volatile in the near term, patient investors could be rewarded as Adobe is among the market-beating stocks riding the AI wave.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Research analysts at Nomura lowered their rating for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock to Neutral from Buy due to \u201climited share price upside.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter Supermicro\u2019s strong guidance for CY4Q23-CY1Q24, we believe Supermico\u2019s performance potential changed from \u201ceasy to beat low market expectations\u201d in CY4Q23 to \u201cless room to beat already-high market expectations\u201d,\u201d analysts said in a Wednesday note.\n\nSMCI shares fell more than 2% in premarket trading.\n\nNomura's view is due to uncertainties related to the gradual easing of CoWoS-S supply in the calendar year 2024 and the potential transition period between Hopper and Blackwell GPUs in the second half of the year.\n\nThe firm's analysts acknowledge that Supermicro\u2019s advanced liquid cooling solutions give it a competitive edge, which should support its gross profit margins. However, they caution that limited order visibility due to the aforementioned uncertainties could make it challenging for Supermicro to exceed sales expectations \u201cand thus this could be a mixed bag, in our view,\u201d they noted.\n\nNomura expects SMCI\u2019s June quarterly sales to be largely in line with its guidance of $5.1-$5.5 billion. It notes that some liquid cooling projects have been pushed to later quarters, which reduces the likelihood of exceeding the guidance.\n\n\u201cHowever, as liquid cooling projects likely carry high GPM and there were still some shipment deliveries, given Supermicro\u2019s dominant position in the market with better bargaining power, we think it maintained its GPM in the quarter, while its main competitor seems less aggressive in pricing due to low profitability,\u201d analysts added.\n\nAnalysts believe Supermicro\u2019s near- to mid-term outlook is unclear due to potential AI server order uncertainties. These stem from new procurement decisions by leading customers and the transition between Nvidia\u2019s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, which may influence SMCI as customers lean towards adopting Blackwell GPU solutions.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNomura sees limited upside for SMCI stock, cuts rating\n\nZelenskiy returns to Washington, to say thanks, build relationships\n\nExclusive-China dials up scrutiny of Big Four audit firms after Evergrande probe, sources say\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Reasons Super Micro Computer Stock Is Still a Great AI Play",
        "content": "While the market is obsessing over chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), there are other semiconductor and hardware companies to look into that have solid exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. One of them is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI).\n\nThe hardware firm specializes in various products and equipment for data centers, which have seen in an explosion of growth over the past decade. If you have been reading about the deployment of AI algorithms, data centers are a critical component of that. With that said, below are three reasons SMCI stock remains a great stock play on AI.\n\nSMCI\u2019s Edge: Quickly Deploying AI Products\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence careened into the social zeitgeist in late 2022 with the public release of OpenAI\u2018s ChatGPT. The power and depth of this generative AI platform and others that spawned after its release incited a rise in investment into AI-enhanced products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo deploy such technologies, however, advanced infrastructure solutions are required. That\u2019s where a relatively small company like Super Micro Computer comes in. Founded in the early 1990s, Super Micro has spent years designing server products and network devices to make data centers efficient nexuses of processing power.\n\nClose ties with chipmaker Nvidia have given Super Micro an edge on competitors like Dell (NYSE:DELL) and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPE) in terms of rapid deployment of AI products such as the high-power H100 and H200 GPUs as well as the GPU interconnects they necessitate.\n\nAnalysts have noted Super Micro\u2019s efficient production capabilities allow it to \u201cmanufacture, assemble, test and ship a server\u201d rack in just a few weeks. Market-watchers and analysts also credit the firm with having the \u201cwidest\u201d product portfolio, allowing it to quickly service enterprises that leverage new GPUs from Nvidia or its chip-making competitors.\n\nTo help facilitate power efficiencies for data centers, Super Micro offers best-in-class cooling systems, which help to offset the high temperatures that advanced AI chips tend to reach once in use.\n\nEarnings Marked By Strong Growth\n\nGiven Super Micro\u2019s unparalleled position in its respective end markets, the server hardware firm enjoyed strong earnings growth in recent quarters. The firm\u2019s second-quarter earnings print for fiscal year 2024, ended Dec. 31, reported quarterly revenue of $3.7 billion, representing growth of more than 103% on a year-over-year basis and 73% growth on a sequential basis. Demand for AI computer products as well as Super Micro\u2019s IT solutions propelled the firm\u2019s financial figures to historic heights.\n\nStory continues\n\nThird-quarter results for fiscal year 2024, which ended on March 31, were also astounding. Super Micro reported net sales of $3.8 billion, nearly tripling from the same period in 2023.\n\nWhile there is certainly a customer concentration risk for investors holding SMCI, the company\u2019s unfettered growth is jaw dropping.\n\nGreat Value Despite Gains\n\nNow it\u2019s time to run through Super Micro Computer stock\u2019s valuation metrics, and many investors might be surprised. Despite its share price skyrocketing nearly 250% in 2023, SMCI remains relatively undervalued to some other large tech firms, especially AI chipmakers like Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). In 2024, SMCI has risen 216%, yet its forward price-to-earnings ratio is around 26.3x forward earnings.\n\nIn a stock market where technology multiples have become increasingly stretched, Super Micro Computer stock does look like a bargain. With the AI craze unabated, Super Micro\u2019s top-line and earnings growth will likely continue to crush estimates, which could lead to more gains for current shareholders.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Is Most-Watched Stock Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) Worth Betting on Now?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this server technology company have returned +10.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, which Super Micro falls in, has gained 3.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Super Micro is expected to post earnings of $8.08 per share, indicating a change of +130.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +101.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $34.31 indicates a change of +44.1% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Super Micro is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.3 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +142.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.93 billion and $23.92 billion estimates indicate +109.7% and +60.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +200%. EPS of $6.65 for the same period compares with $1.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.89%. The EPS surprise was +15.05%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That\u2019s when Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell posted on X, \u201cWe\u2019re building a Dell AI factory with @nvidia to power @grok for @xai @elonmusk.\u201d Just the revelation that Dell is collaborating with the almighty Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is already huge news for Dell Technologies.\n\nAlso on June 19, Musk clarified in a X posting, \u201cTo be precise, Dell is assembling half of the racks that are going into the supercomputer that xAI is building.\u201d\n\nThen, that same day, Musk posted on X that \u201cSMC\u201d or Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) will build the other half of the AI-supercomputer racks.\n\nAt this point, if you envision a bright future for xAI and Grok, then you might be tempted to load up on Super Micro Computer stock.\n\nYou can do this if you\u2019d like, since an arrangement with Musk is usually great news. Yet, I encourage you to consider investing in Dell, as well.\n\nDell: From Underdog to AI Hero?\n\nMy objection to investing in Super Micro Computer right now is that the market already assigned a very rich valuation to the company. There\u2019s no underdog story here, since Super Micro Computer is already the top dog.\n\nIn contrast, Dell Technologies has been out of favor, and perhaps even a punchline, for years. After all, young people don\u2019t rely on PCs anymore. However, Dell\u2019s reinvention as a developer of AI-ready PCs means that the company can rise from the ashes in 2024.\n\nActually, the company is already rising and reclaiming some of its former glory. Dell stock\u2019s year-to-date rally has been impressive, but it\u2019s not overdone. The company could still be considered an underdog, or at least not a market darling yet, based on Dell\u2019s valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe can apply a couple of commonly cited metrics to support our point. On a trailing 12-month basis, Dell\u2019s GAAP price-to-earnings ratio is 28.27x. For comparison\u2019s sake, the sector median P/E ratio is 30.22x, and Super Micro Computer\u2019s P/E ratio is 46.18x.\n\nSome folks prefer to use the price-to-sales ratio instead of the P/E ratio, and that\u2019s not a problem. As it turns out, Dell Technologies\u2019 trailing 12-month P/S ratio is 1.1x, versus the sector median P/S ratio of 2.98x.\n\nMoreover, Super Micro Computer\u2019s P/S ratio is 3.8x. Thus, it\u2019s not difficult to determine which company involved in the Musk deal has the more attractive valuation.\n\nDell Stock: The Turnaround Story Is Just Getting Started\n\nDell Technologies still isn\u2019t a heavily favored technology company like Super Micro Computer or Nvidia are. Yet, the deal with Musk and xAI should put Dell in the limelight and bring some reluctant investors into the fold.\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock could also be worth buying if it comes down 20% or 30%. However, if you want to get involved in a turnaround story that\u2019s just getting started, you can buy Dell stock right now. It\u2019s a great way to get immediate AI-server industry exposure for your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying 2 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Many investors see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) as the quintessential artificial intelligence (AI) stock because its chips provide the computing horsepower needed to train the most advanced AI systems, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Tesla's full self-driving software.\n\nHowever, some hedge fund billionaires sold Nvidia stock during the first quarter, while purchasing shares of Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) and/or Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), two supercharged AI stocks with year-to-date returns of 59% and 198%, respectively.\n\nLouis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 2,006 shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 19%. Meanwhile, Bacon started a small position in Super Micro Computer. Israel Englander of Millennium Management sold 720,000 shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 35%. Meanwhile, Englander increased his positions in Palantir and Super Micro Computer by 4% and 235%, respectively. Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 2.9 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 68%. Meanwhile, Laffont increased his position in Palantir by 40%.\n\nTrades made by Israel Englander are especially noteworthy because Millennium Management handily beat the S&P 500 over the last three years , and it ranks as the second-best performing hedge fund of all-time as measured by net gains since inception. Here's what investors should know about Palantir and Supermicro.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir specializes in data analytics. Its software lets government and commercial clients integrate data, develop artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models, and build applications that lean on those data sets and models to improve decision-making. Palantir recently introduced its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a product that brings support for large language models and generative AI to its existing software.\n\nCertain industry analysts have praised the company for its technological prowess. Forrester Research ranked Palantir Foundry as the best AI/ML platform in a report published in July 2022. And Dresner Advisory Services ranked Palantir as a leader in the AI/ML and data science market in a report published in August 2023.\n\nHowever, other analysts are skeptical. Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital says conversations with industry observers and company employees have led to the conclusion that Palantir does not offer \"anything truly differentiated when it comes to generative AI.\"\n\nPalantir reported reasonably good financial results in the first quarter, beating estimates on the top line and meeting expectations on the bottom line. Its customer count increased 42% to 554, and the average existing customer spent 11% more. In turn, revenue increased 21% to $634 million, the third consecutive sequential acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings increased 60% to $0.08 per diluted share.\n\nStory continues\n\nCFO Dave Glazer said the commercial segment benefited from \"unprecedented demand driven by momentum from AIP.\" However, the stock still slipped 7% following the first-quarter report because management guided for full-year revenue growth of 20%, implying a slight deceleration in the coming quarters. Analysts anticipated full-year revenue growth of 22%.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Palantir to grow adjusted earnings per share at 22% annually through 2026. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 97 times earnings look very expensive. Investors should be cautious with this stock. Personally, I plan to avoid Palantir until earnings growth accelerates or the valuation improves.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs high-performance computing platforms for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its portfolio includes servers and storage systems, ranging from individual devices to full rack solutions. Its products can be optimized for use cases like artificial intelligence and 5G infrastructure, and they feature chips like Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and Intel central processing units (CPUs).\n\nImportantly, Supermicro is the market leader in AI servers due to manufacturing prowess and its building-block approach to product development. To elaborate, nearly half of its workforce are engineers, and it handles most research and development internally. \"Our engineering aptitude, coupled with our internal manufacturing capability, enables rapid prototyping and product roll-out.\"\n\nAdditionally, Supermicro's modular product design reduces time to market, and affords clients flexibility in designing custom solutions. It can \"quickly assemble a broad portfolio of solutions by leveraging common building blocks across product lines.\" In other words, Supermicro can rapidly integrate the latest CPUs, GPUs, and memory into preassembled server chassis, such that it often beats competitors to market by two to six months.\n\nIndeed, Supermicro \"anticipates being first-to-market in deploying full rack clusters featuring Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.\" That is advantageous because businesses are eager to purchase AI hardware, so they are turning to the server maker that brings computing products to market at the fastest clip. As a result, Supermicro's AI server market share is expected to reach 23% by the end of 2024, up from 10% at the beginning of the year.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 48% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 47 times earnings look very reasonable. Indeed, it gives a PEG ratio -- the price-to-earnings ratio divided by the forecasted earnings growth -- of roughly 1. For context, using the same methodology, Palantir currently has a PEG ratio of 4.4.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "1 Phenomenal Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "content": "The pace of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption has only accelerated over the past year and has shuffled the ranks of some of the world's largest companies, with several household names vying for bragging rights. Microsoft currently leads the pack, having unseated Apple, each with a market cap of roughly $3.4 trillion. Nvidia's rise through the ranks has been breathtaking to behold, having nearly tripled over the past year to take the third spot at $3 trillion. Several other major purveyors of AI, namely Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, boast valuations of between $1.3 trillion and $2.3 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of just $49 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like sacrilege to propose that Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, might be headed for the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating adoption of AI has increased the need for servers capable of running and training AI systems, and the company's long track record of success makes Supermicro a clear candidate for inclusion in this elite fraternity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFlexible server options\n\nWhile Supermicro has made a splash in recent years, investors might be surprised to learn the company has been creating customized servers for more than three decades. The accelerating adoption of generative AI shone a spotlight on the under-the-radar server maker, bringing it out of the shadows.\n\nSupermicro's claim to fame is the company's highly customizable building-block architecture, which helps the company provide server solutions for customers of all sizes and shapes. Furthermore, Supermicro's long focus on energy efficiency has taken on greater significance as cost becomes a factor. It also offers a variety of free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air-cooling technologies, giving each customer just what they're looking for.\n\nThe company has partnerships with all the leading chipmakers, giving it access to the most in-demand AI processors. This includes strong working relationships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\n\nThis approach has served the company well. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 200% year over year to $3.85 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $6.65 jumped 308%. Management is guiding that its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year guidance to revenue of $14.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $23.69, which would represent growth of 109% and 100%, respectively.\n\nManagement reports that Supermicro is growing at nearly 20 times the industry average, which clearly shows the company is taking market share from the competition. Analysts at Bank of America agree, suggesting Supermicro will increase its market share from 10% last year to 17% by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nSupermicro is one of the premier names in the AI server market. The company's agility has been paramount in taking share from its rivals, as its building-block server architecture means it has something for everyone. Supermicro has also established critical partnerships with the chipmakers that supply the company with the most requested processors, giving it ample supply to meet the accelerating demand.\n\nDespite those advantages, it will still be some time before Supermicro ascends the ranks to become a trillionaire. According to Wall Street, Supermicro is poised to generate revenue of $14.9 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $305 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\n\nIt's important to put this in context: The company is ramping up its production capabilities just to be able to generate sales of $25 billion annually, so a nearly 20-fold increase in revenue is still off in the distant future.\n\nIf the company were able to keep up its triple-digit year-over-year growth rate, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap by 2029. However, keeping up that frantic pace of growth for five years would be unparalleled for a well-established company. Yet, even if we cut its growth rate in half, Supermicro could hypothetically reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\n\nWhile that might sound far-fetched, the evidence suggests it's more likely than you might think. BofA analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya posited the AI data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the coming three years, and by taking share from its rivals, Supermicro's revenue could \"grow even faster.\"\n\nHe's not the only one who thinks the data center upgrade cycle is about to take off. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes the installed base of data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years to support the accelerating adoption of AI.\n\nSo if Supermicro is successful in capturing even a small part of that fast-growing market, the path to the $1 trillion club will be paved with profits.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 AI Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Palantir 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Palantir Technologies' (NYSE: PLTR) stock price has rallied about 50% this year as the data analytics company dazzled the bulls with its accelerating revenue growth and soaring profits. Its revenue rose 17% in 2023, and it expects 20%-21% growth in 2024 as its government business stabilizes and its U.S. commercial business accelerates. It's also stayed profitable for six consecutive quarters, and analysts anticipate 71% earnings growth this year.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Palantir to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 56%. That rosy outlook, along with Palantir's growth potential in the AI market, drove its stock higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut Palantir's stock isn't cheap right now at 21 times this year's sales, and it could struggle to maintain those premium valuations if the macro and competitive headwinds throttle its near-term growth. So if you're worried the stock will lose its luster again, you should check out two less valuable AI companies that might just be worth more than Palantir in three years: Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU).\n\nWhat do these two AI companies do?\n\nSuper Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, produces high-performance, liquid-cooled servers for demanding data center tasks. It generates about half of its revenue from dedicated AI servers, and its long-term partnership with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's new data center GPUs before many of its top competitors. Bank of America expects its share of the dedicated AI server market to grow from 10% to 17% over the next three years.\n\nBaidu owns the largest online search engine in China. It also owns a majority share of iQiyi, one of the country's leading streaming video platforms, the Apollo software platform for autonomous vehicles, and the Baidu AI Cloud platform. It generates most of its revenue from online ads, but it's been diversifying that core business with Managed Business Pages (which empower it to manage a client's entire brand presence within its ecosystem) to reduce its dependence on traditional search and display ads. It's also beefing up its mobile app with more tools and expanding its non-marketing (cloud, AI, and other) division to reduce its exposure to the macro-sensitive advertising market.\n\nWhy could these two companies become more valuable than Palantir?\n\nSupermicro and Baidu could become more valuable than Palantir because they both look cheaper relative to their estimated sales growth over the next three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompany Market Cap Price-to-Sales Ratio (Current Year) Estimated Revenue CAGR (Next 3 Years) Palantir $57.6 billion 21.3 20% Supermicro $49.6 billion 3.3 58% Baidu $31.0 billion 1.6 6%\n\nData source: Yahoo Finance, Marketscreener.\n\nIf Palantir maintains its lofty price-to-sales ratio through 2026, it could be worth $80.6 billion in a bull case scenario by 2026. But if the macro or competitive headwinds unexpectedly curb its growth, its price-to-sales ratio could easily be cut in half.\n\nIf Supermicro matches analysts' expectations and simply maintains the same price-to-sales ratio over the next three years, it could be worth about $93 billion by 2026. It should fetch an even higher valuation if it's finally revalued as a higher-growth AI stock instead of just a legacy server maker like Dell Technologies.\n\nBaidu's recent growth has been throttled by competitive and macro headwinds in China, but its valuation is being severely compressed by the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. If those tensions ease, we might see Baidu's stock trade at about 4 to 5 times its forward sales again -- as it did about four years ago. If Baidu merely matches analysts' estimates and trades at about 4 times sales by 2026, it would be worth $88 billion. But that's a base case scenario: it could be worth a lot more if its new cloud and AI investments pay off and significantly boost its sales again.\n\nBut are Supermicro and Baidu better buys than Palantir?\n\nWe should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they indicate that Palantir's stock is more richly valued than Supermicro and Baidu. Benjamin Graham said: \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\" I believe Palantir is still in the voting phase as investors pay a premium for its AI-driven features, but Supermicro and Baidu have advanced into the weighing phase -- so they could both outperform Palantir over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

This company also operates in the AI space and has seen earnings climb -- and this player actually benefits from growth of Nvidia and other chip designers.\n\nCould this Nvidia- and market-beating stock offer investors a repeat performance in the second half? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nServing AI data centers\n\nThe player that's wowed the market in recent times actually has been around for quite a while -- more than 30 years to be exact. I'm talking about Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of servers, workstations, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment crucial to the operations of AI data centers. Supermicro's revenue progressively rose over the years, but the AI boom marked a clear turning point, helping sales and net income to skyrocket.\n\nEarlier this year, Supermicro even reported its first $3 billion quarter -- that was the company's annual revenue level as recently as 2021.\n\nSupermicro has benefited from demand for top AI chips because customers generally need not only a chip but a variety of equipment -- and the company integrates these chips into its products. So when Nvidia or Intel, for example, launch a new chip, this creates demand for Supermicro's products too. To maximize the benefit, Supermicro works hand-in-hand with these companies, monitoring their development pipelines so that it can immediately include their innovations in its equipment.\n\nAnd Supermicro's \"building blocks\" process -- with most of its products sharing common parts -- also makes it easy to quickly produce equipment tailored to customers' needs. All of this has helped the company grow five times faster than its industry over the past 12 months.\n\nThere's reason to be optimistic this will continue because AI market growth is in its early days. Analysts predict today's $200 billion market will reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade -- and this should translate into sustained demand for Supermicro's products.\n\nStory continues\n\nA new growth driver\n\nOn top of this, Supermicro's direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology may serve as a new growth driver for the company. AI data centers generate a tremendous amount of heat, and this situation only will worsen as workloads intensify.\n\nBut Supermicro's DLC technology solves this problem, and customers now are taking notice. Supermicro's DLC solutions, increasing from zero market share to less than 1% in the company's 30-year history, could take as much as a 30% share over the next couple of years, The Taipei Times reported, citing the company's chief executive officer Charles Liang.\n\nAll of this means Supermicro's spectacular growth may be far from over, and in the second half of this year, Nvidia's release of its game-changing new architecture -- Blackwell -- and chip could offer the equipment maker a new boost. Supermicro recently offered a sneak peek of its Blackwell products and says it's focused on developing new generative AI and inference-optimized systems accommodating the market leaders' latest chips.\n\nCould Supermicro beat Nvidia?\n\nNow, let's get back to our question: Could Supermicro continue to beat Nvidia and the general market in the second half? I think it's very likely this equipment giant will outperform the market, thanks to its growth prospects and position in the hot area of AI.\n\nAs for surpassing Nvidia's gains, it's possible. In spite of Supermicro's first-half increase, the company trades at a significant discount to the chip designer -- about 24x forward earnings estimates versus 46x for Nvidia. At the same time, the earnings-per-share growth estimate of 62% for the coming five years for Supermicro tops average estimates of 46% for Nvidia.\n\nThese points could attract investors and help Supermicro soar in the second half. But even if this top equipment company doesn't offer us a repeat performance in the coming months, that's OK. Supermicro still has what it takes to deliver earnings growth and share performance over the long term, and that's great news for investors today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Generative AI Sales Could Soar 2,040%: My Pick for the Best AI Stock to Buy Now (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) uses large language models and other machine learning models to create text, images, video, audio, and computer code. Use cases range from digital assistants that improve worker productivity to intelligent avatars that make video games more lifelike.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence expects generative AI revenue to exceed $1.3 trillion in 2032, up from $63.5 billion in 2023.\u00a0Put differently, Bloomberg believes spending across generative AI hardware, software, and services will surge 2,040% over the next nine years.\n\nSome analysts see an even bigger market. For instance, McKinsey & Company research suggests generative AI will eventually contribute $7.9 trillion annually to the global economy. Opportunities like that come along rarely, so investors should position their portfolios accordingly.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is a logical stock to own. In fact, I think most investors should have some exposure to the chipmaker. But Nvidia is by no means the only company that will benefit, and owning a single AI stock is a poor strategy. Here's why I think Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is the best AI stock to buy now.\n\nNvidia dominates the market for artificial intelligence processors\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) have long been the gold standard in accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence. The spotlight has certainly intensified over the past year, given that Nvidia's revenue and net income have grown at a triple-digit pace for four consecutive quarters. But investors should understand that Nvidia did not stumble mindlessly into its recent success.\n\nNvidia has dominated the data center GPU market for nearly two decades, and the company has been setting performance records at the MLPerfs -- objective benchmarks that measure how quickly AI systems can perform AI training and inference tasks -- since those tests were created in 2018.\u00a0One reason for that success is the CUDA programming language, which lets Nvidia GPUs (originally built for computer graphics) accelerate other data center workloads.\n\nNvidia introduced CUDA in 2006, and the platform has since expanded to include hundreds of frameworks and software libraries that streamline data preparation, model training, and AI application development. No other chipmaker has a supporting software ecosystem that is remotely comparable, so Nvidia has naturally emerged as the leader in AI processors. To quote The Wall Street Journal, \"Nvidia chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe problem (if there is one) is valuation. Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually over the next three to five years. If that number is divided into its current price-to-earnings ratio of 74, the result is a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 2.2. That is not exorbitant. In fact, that multiple is a discount to the three-year average of 3.1, so risk-tolerant investors should consider buying a small position today.\n\nHowever, I think Super Micro (also called Supermicro) is the better buy right now because the stock is much cheaper, yet the company stands to benefit greatly as businesses invest in generative AI hardware.\n\nSupermicro is gaining share in the artificial intelligence server market\n\nSupermicro builds accelerated computing platforms. Its portfolio spans individual servers and storage systems to full-rack solutions purpose-built for enterprise and cloud data centers. The company works closely with partners like Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices to equip its hardware with the latest chips.\n\nSamik Chatterjee at JPMorgan Chase sees Supermicro as the \"leading company in the AI compute market.\" More importantly, Supermicro is quickly gaining market share. The company accounted for 10% of AI server sales through the quarter ended in December, but Tom Blakely at KeyBanc says that figure could reach 23% this year. He also believes Supermicro has \"competitive moats that should sustain if not expand this share in coming years.\"\n\nBlakely is referring to internal manufacturing capabilities and a unique building-block approach to product development. Engineers comprise about half of Supermicro's workforce, and the company handles most research and development internally (in Silicon Valley). In turn, Supermicro can quickly and efficiently bring new products to market, and its modular approach only enhances that ability.\n\nSpecifically, Supermicro is often first to market with new technologies because it can \"quickly assemble a broad portfolio of solutions by leveraging common building blocks across product lines.\" In other words, the company can quickly outfit partially preassembled servers with the latest central processing units (CPUs), GPUs, memory, and interconnects, such that it often beats its competitors to market.\n\nCEO Charles Liang recently highlighted that advantage: \"We provide optimized AI solutions at scale, offering a time-to-market advantage and shorter lead times over our competition.\"\n\nSupermicro trades at a more reasonable valuation than Nvidia\n\nThe number of annual AI server shipments is expected to increase sixfold between 2023 and 2028, according to 650 Group.\u00a0Supermicro is well positioned to benefit as demand increases, given its market leadership, which itself is supported by internal engineering capabilities and a unique approach to product development.\n\nWall Street expects Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 48% annually over the next three to five years. If that number is divided into its current valuation of 47 times earnings, the result is a PEG ratio below 1. To be clear, Supermicro is not a hidden gem. In fact, it was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 during the first half of 2024.\u00a0But its valuation is very reasonable, especially compared to Nvidia's PEG ratio of 2.2.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The stock market hasn't been slowing down this year after a strong performance in 2023. The S&P 500 continues to break records and has risen by nearly 15%\u00a0year to date. Investors continue to rake in some tremendous profits from many great investments.\n\nThree of the best-performing stocks on the index have already more than doubled in value this year. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Vistra (NYSE: VST) have all been soaring. Here's a look at their returns, why they've been rallying, and whether they're still good buys right now.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer: 194%\n\nThe best-performing stock on the S&P 500 this year has been Super Micro Computer, also known as Supermicro. The stock has been a big play because of its role in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company provides server and storage services that are essential for businesses investing in AI and building the necessary infrastructure to support next-generation technologies and complex AI models.\n\nBusiness has taken off for Supermicro due to the soaring demand for its products and services. Over the trailing 12 months, the company has generated more than $11.8 billion in revenue. That's more than double the $5.2 billion in sales it posted for all of fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022). The sheer growth the company has achieved is why the company has been a hot buy with growth investors. While some companies may talk up their AI-fueled opportunities, the proof is in the results with Supermicro.\n\nWith the stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 22 (based on analyst estimates), it's arguably one of the better-priced AI stocks out there. It's not too late to buy this surging stock, as the hype around AI could drive its share price even higher in the second half of the year.\n\n2. Nvidia: 151%\n\nAfter a monstrous year in 2023, when its share price soared by nearly 240%, Nvidia's stock has continued to be a red-hot buy for AI investors this year as its valuation has topped $3 trillion. And it's hard to blame them, either, given the company's results. With limited competition to worry about in the AI chip market, Nvidia's results have been phenomenal.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, for the period ending April 28, its top line totaled $26 billion and was up 18% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Compared to the same period last year, the growth rate was a staggering 262%, which means sales were more than 3.5 times what they were in the prior-year period.\n\nThe company says it is seeing accelerating demand for its products and services. With AI touching just about every industry in the world, it's hard not to like Nvidia's long-term growth prospects. At a forward P/E of 47, it's a pricier option than Supermicro, but its price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.4 suggests it may not be that overpriced.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's high valuation could limit its gains this year, although I still expect it to rally in the weeks and months ahead due to its strong results. As long as you're willing to hold the stock for the long term, it still may not be too late to buy the stock.\n\n3. Vistra: 127%\n\nVistra isn't in the business of selling AI chips or servers, but the energy company can still indirectly benefit from the growing popularity of generative AI. As AI use ramps up, energy needs will also increase. With Vistra investing in alternative energy sources, it's in a good position to meet those needs while also being a more diversified energy stock.\n\nIn March, the company completed an acquisition of Energy Harbor, making it a bigger player in nuclear energy. CEO Jim Burke says the deal \"represents our commitment to leading a responsible transformation of the country's energy supply to greener energy sources through the expansion of our zero-carbon generation portfolio.\"\n\nOver the past four quarters, Vistra has posted a profit of $598 million on revenue totaling $13.4 billion. Its forward P/E multiple of 18 looks attractive, and what's even better is its incredibly low PEG ratio of 0.75, indicating that this can still be an exceptional investment for growth investors and that there's still room for it to rise further in value this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is an amazing fast-casual restaurant stock. The company perfectly positioned itself as an alternative to a slew of burger joints by offering custom-made burritos and burrito bowls consisting of fresh ingredients \u2013 nothing is ever frozen.\n\nThat\u2019s why Chipotle grew to over 3,400 locations. And unlike many other chains, Chipotle doesn\u2019t sell franchises. All of its locations are owned and operated by the company, so Chipotle can do a better job in maintaining quality and standards.\n\nAnd if you thought Chipotle stock was too expensive to buy without fractional shares, think again. The company in late June executed a 50-for-1 stock split so shares of CMG stock are just over $60.\n\nThat makes them far more accessible to retail investors and it\u2019s much easier to make options trades with CMG stock as well.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up 14.1% from a year ago.

The company also sells modules, which are extensions that customers can add to customize their platforms and increase protection.\n\nModules include endpoint security, data security, IT operations, threat intelligence and more.\n\nCrowdStrike says 65% of its customers purchase and use at least five modules, making it a lucrative business model.\n\nRevenue for the company\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $921 million, up 33% from a year ago. Subscription revenue was $872.2 million, up 34% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nCRWD stock is up 51% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the king of streaming services, ranking No. 1 as the biggest paid-for streaming company on the planet (it trails only YouTube, which is free to watch and ad-free with a premium subscription).\n\nNetflix currently has 269.6 million paid subscribers \u2013 a number that increased dramatically last year when the company dumped its longtime password-sharing program and began charging customers an $8 surcharge to grant access to an account outside of the household.\n\nThe decision was controversial with customers, but wildly effective. Paid memberships are up from 232.6 million a year ago because people find value in Netflix\u2019s content.\n\nRevenue of $9.3 billion in the first quarter was up 14.8% from a year ago, and Netflix forecast additional growth to $9.49 billion when it reports Q2 earnings in mid-July.\n\nNFLX stock is up 40% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) proves that you don\u2019t have to be a tech company to be an A-rated stock.\n\nThe California-based company sells kitchenware and home furnishings, operating under the brands that include Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm.\n\nIn addition to retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K., Williams-Sonoma franchises brands to third parties that operate in the Middle East, Mexico and the Philippines.\n\nThe company is also in the process of a 2-for-1 stock split. Shareholders as of June 27 will receive the split through a stock dividend that will be issued on July 8; shares will then start trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 9.\n\nBut if you missed the split, there\u2019s still plenty of reasons to have WSM stock. The company saw revenues drop in the first quarter to $1.66 billion from $1.75 billion a year ago.\n\nBut it was also more efficient, with profits of $802 million up from $675 million; net earnings of $265.6 million versus $156.5 million a year ago, and earnings per share of $4.07 versus $2.35 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nWSM stock is up 39% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had LONG position(s) in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.\u00a0Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had a LONG position in NVDA.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, Super Micro Computer, Coinbase, MicroStrategy and Marathon",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Super Micro Computer SMCI, Coinbase Global COIN, MicroStrategy MSTR and Marathon Digital MARA.\n\nA Powerful Investing Tool: Know a Stock's Relative Strength\n\nA recent post of mine on social media about relative strength received a lot of interest, so I figured that I would write a commentary about it. In the post, I illustrated the power of relative strength, or what I call RS, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve studied hundreds of indicators, both technical and fundamental, and nothing comes remotely close to relative strength (raw, not RSI).\"\n\nWhat Is Relative Strength?\n\nRelative Strength (RS) is a price-based analysis used by market technicians and traders to evaluate a stock\u2019s price performance versus the performance of a benchmark such as the S&P 500 Index, an industry group, or an underlying commodity.\n\nBefore I jump into the \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d of how I have successfully implemented relative strength in my investing career, there are three common misconceptions I want to debunk, including:\n\n1. RS is NOT a Signal: Relative strength is a secondary indicator, which means that I use it in conjunction with other analysis and will never take a trade based solely on RS.\n\n2. There are Many Ways to Use RS: Today, I will discuss how I use RS, but understand there are many methods and ways to utilize it. What works for me may not work for you. Nonetheless, perhaps by reading this article, you can grasp some \u201cgolden nuggets\u201d and learn to use RS within your investment framework or use a hybrid version of my approach.\n\n3. RS is Different From RSI: I implement what I call \u201craw RS,\u201d which is different from the popular Relative Strength Index (RSI) that many traders use. RSI is an oscillator, which I think has value, but that\u2019s for another time.\n\nHow RS is Like a Beach Ball Underwater\n\nThink of a stock as a beach ball and a poor (down) market as someone holding the beach ball underwater. In a down market, a stock that continues to bounce or resist the market weakness is worth watching further. Another way to think about RS is to think of a tennis ball versus an egg. When an egg hits the ground, it breaks (weak stock), and when a tennis ball hits the ground, it bounces (strong stock).\n\nWhy is Relative Strength such a Powerful Indicator?\n\nHistorically, roughly 75% of a stock\u2019s move is correlated with the S&P 500 Index. In other words, most stocks move up in bull markets and fall in bear markets. When a stock refuses to move lower in a downward market, the stock is sending out a big clue.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat will happen when the market steadies if you can\u2019t bring the stock down in a bearish market? In an overwhelming majority of instances, the stock that held up best during the market\u2019s downtrend dramatically outperforms. For this reason, it\u2019s best to look for relative strength when the market is weak because RS candidates will stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nRS Examples\n\nIn my personal investing framework, I utilize RS in various situations and for various timeframes. Here are three real-world examples from my trading history.\n\nBear Markets Breed Opportunity: Super Micro Computer\n\nThe best time to look for long-term RS opportunities is within a bear market. New, inexperienced investors tend to get frustrated and give up during bear markets. Conversely, savvy investors understand that bear markets present easily identifiable extremes.\n\nFurther, history proves that even the most bear markets eventually recover and can provide rich opportunities. The year 2022 was one such example. As inflation soared, interest rates rose, and war broke out in Europe, the Nasdaq 100 ETFsuffered its worst bear market in years, falling more than 30%.\n\nHigh-valuation, fast-moving, growth-oriented stocks such as Nvidia were slammed as investors went full \u201crisk-off.\u201d However, in Q4 2022, Super Micro Computer, a high-octane growth stock, printed fresh 52-week highs while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit 52-week lows. Sure enough, after stocks bottomed, SMCI became a leading stock and has provided multi-bag gains since.\n\nThe beauty of RS is that investors did not have to understand that \u201csmart money\u201d was betting SMCI would be a leader in the coming Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution. Instead, investors merely had to notice that the stock was exhibiting standout relative strength.\n\nPrice Action Versus News\n\nAnother powerful way to use RS is to evaluate how a stock acts relative to how it \u201cshould\u201d be acting. In June 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Coinbase Global with operating its crypto asset trading platform as an unregistered exchange. As expected, shares dove on the news, losing 17% for the week. However, over the next two weeks, COIN recuperated 14% of those gain, which was a sign of relative strength. Over the next three weeks, the stock would rise 69%.\n\nRelative Strength Versus a Commodity or Industry\n\nMy most recent windfall trade attributed to RS was in the crypto sector. When trading a stock based on RS, looking at the stock in a vacuum is not enough. Instead, one should evaluate how the stock acts in relation to its industry peers and an underlying commodity.\n\nBitcoin fell 4.33% during the week of June 10th and 5.21% during the week of June 17th, dragging several Bitcoin proxies like MicroStrategy with it. However, Marathon Digital, a leading Bitcoin miner, rose 1.04% during the week of June 10th and lost a minuscule 1.34% the following week \u2013 exemplifying classic relative strength.\n\nWhen Bitcoin finally bounced more than 5% on July 1st, MARA broke out of a picture-perfect bull flag pattern and gained more than 14% in a single session.\n\nRS Tips & Tricks\n\nSort your watch list by % change on down days and focus on the stocks that hold up best. Contrary to popular belief, down markets are far more valuable than up markets. Observe the action in sister stocks and related commodities to understand your stock\u2019s strength better. Use RS to gain an edge and conviction, but also use it in concert with a full investing framework. Observe how a stock reacts in the wake of poor news. Poor news is bullish if a stock rises in the face of it.\n\nBottom Line\n\nRelative Strength, or RS, is the most powerful indicator I have studied throughout my investing career. Better yet, RS works off common sense, is easily observed, and will get you in the strongest stocks.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "The S&P 500 index is a prestigious club comprising 500 of the most prominent American companies. A company that joins the S&P 500 only does so after careful consideration by a committee that aims to ensure the index includes only the cream of the crop.\n\nBut even stocks in the S&P 500 aren't immune to adversity. Some S&P 500 companies are struggling even as the index sits near all-time highs. Some of these stocks are down from their former highs by as much as 43%.\n\nInstead of chasing what's hot, consider why these three struggling stocks made the S&P 500 in the first place. Their current struggles don't change the fact they are wonderful buy-and-hold candidates worth considering for your portfolio today.\n\n1. A strong play on artificial intelligence\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is one of the index's newest members; it was added to the S&P 500 just a few months ago. The company began in electronic components in the early 1990s, but its primary business today is building modular server systems for data centers. Companies without the know-how or desire to custom-build data centers can turn to Super Micro Computer for turnkey systems.\n\nDemand for artificial intelligence (AI) has corporations heavily investing in data centers, which helped accelerate Super Micro Computer's revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarters. The stock has been a winner, surging over 200% over the past year. However, shares have cooled and are now down 31% over potential concerns about how sustainable this growth is.\n\nWhile triple-digit growth won't last forever, the future remains bright. Experts anticipate sustained investments in data centers over the coming years, which should steadily boost Supermicro's business.\n\nSuper Micro Computer has noted it's taking market share, which underlines its strong reputation in the field. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by over 50% annually for the next three to five years. That makes the stock a potential bargain today at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 34.\n\n2. A legendary consumer staples name getting back on its feet\n\nMost consumers are familiar with Clorox(NYSE: CLX) and its various household products from brands like Clorox, Pine-Sol, Brita, Glad, Burt's Bees, and more. Consumers gravitate toward these products due to name recognition, and people routinely buy them. That makes Clorox a durable business that performs well in good and bad times.\n\nClorox's stock has been uncharacteristically volatile; shares are down over 40% from their highs, its steepest drop since the early 2000s.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, what happened? First, the stock did very well during the pandemic due to increased demand for disinfectant products. Shares surged to over 40 times earnings, a very steep price for a consumer staples stock.\n\nThen, hackers breached Clorox last summer, disrupting the company's operations. The attack hit Clorox's supply chain, hurting the company's ability to process and fulfill orders. The breach was the catalyst that began the stock's reversion to a more reasonable price.\n\nClorox is getting back on its feet. Analysts anticipate revenue growth beginning next year and earnings growth of 10% annually for the next three to five years. While a P/E ratio of 40 was nonsensical, today's forward P/E of 23 makes the stock a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\n3. A leader in renewable energy\n\nNextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE) is the world's largest producer of renewable energy and America's largest electric utility business. The company has benefited from broad growth of renewable energy in America over the past several decades. Renewable energy is still just over 20% of all electric power generated in the United States, leaving a lot of room to grow over the upcoming decades. The company is also a well-known dividend growth stock; management has raised the dividend for 30 consecutive years.\n\nEnergy and utility businesses require a lot of investment to build new capacity and maintain infrastructure, so NextEra relies heavily on borrowing money. Rising interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which is a headwind for NextEra's business and has cooled sentiment on the stock. Shares have fallen over 20% from their high, though they've already rebounded from as much as 40% down.\n\nShares are still reasonably priced at just over 20 times earnings, notably below its average P/E of 28 over the past decade. Investors can expect continued demand for renewable energy to fuel steady growth for NextEra, which has helped the stock outperform the S&P 500 for decades. NextEra is an excellent company that is trading at a solid price today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The AI sector has significantly boosted the tech industry, attracting investors with innovative technology advancements promising substantial returns. Stocks linked to generative AI have surged, potentially marking the start of a significant industry uptrend.\n\nInvesting in AI stocks remains viable despite recent surges. Spending on AI tech is projected to skyrocket, offering ample growth opportunities for new entrants in the market. For example, analysts fond of AI are now looking beyond giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThese three undervalued AI stocks I\u2019m about to discuss boast strong growth, key tech partnerships, and strategic acquisitions. Such factors place them in a unique position for tech sector prominence and potential high returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest and top-performing AI stock striding alongside Nvidia, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an AI stock to buy and hold. In 2023, the company\u2019s sales rose 37%. Forecasts suggest future revenue increases could come in around 110%, with earnings likely to surge more than 100% in 2024.SMCI holds a significant 10% share in the AI server market, poised to potentially increase to 17% as the market expands by 150%, per Bank of America.\n\nSuper Micro recently experienced a significant pullback after a volatile period in March and April, despite its remarkable rise of over 1,800% over the past two years. This downturn, though alarming to recent investors, might present an opportunity rather than a catastrophic decline. Concerns over AI demand and stock valuation drove some to sell, yet the fundamentals suggest potential for recovery.\n\nWith ongoing strong demand expected in AI, Super Micro\u2019s unique technologies like liquid cooling and modular server design could bolster its position in the data center market.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) excels in diverse sectors, notably AI with Microsoft Cloud and Copilot driving growth. These factors have allowed the company to see $35.1 billion in revenue in Q3 2024 alone. Analysts rate this stock as a strong buy with 11% upside, reflecting consistent market outperformance and a robust financial performance trend.\n\nRecently, IAS and Microsoft extended their partnership from 2020, focusing on post-bid brand safety, view-ability, and traffic measurement in Microsoft\u2019s ad tools. This allows advertisers to verify engagement and media quality using IAS metrics alongside Microsoft\u2019s audience data.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft also recently announced its 2024 Partner of the Year Awards, recognizing global contributions from its partners. Selected from 4,700 nominations across 115 countries, winners were celebrated across various industries. Nicole Dezen, Microsoft\u2019s chief partner officer, highlighted the record-breaking submissions, emphasizing collaboration\u2019s strength and community growth.\n\nOther category winners included EY, JourneyTeam, PwC, Lenovo, and Nvidia, with Dell Technologies, Elastic, KPMG, RSM, Softchoice, and Version 1 as runners-up. Nicole Dezen emphasized the awards\u2019 prestige, celebrating partners\u2019 exceptional contributions and impactful innovations in business transformation and social impact.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nCurrently expanding drastically in global data center footprint, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL)\u00a0 is one of the most promising AI companies to consider. With its strong financial standing, Oracle aims to capitalize more on the AI trend and plans to power its data centers with renewable energy in 2025. The company\u2019s impressive commitment to invest in its AI capabilities certainly places Oracle at the center of this discussion. At least, that\u2019s my view.\n\nOn June 27, ORCL saw double-digit gains after its Q4 earnings report. Although results came in below expectations, investors believe that the company\u2019s forward guidance will propel new cloud partnerships with big tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft.

        "title": "AI Stock Showdown: Dell vs. Super Micro Computer in the Race for Musk\u2019s Billions",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), a provider of artificial intelligence server infrastructure, became the market\u2019s new shiny metal object in 2024.\n\nThere are reasons to like Super Micro Computer, including an agreement to manufacture hardware for a well-known billionaire. However, it\u2019s problematic that Super Micro Computer stock is expensive and susceptible to a sustained pullback.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable if you\u2019re on the hunt for the \u201cnext\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, the market has already discovered and lionized Super Micro Computer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, there\u2019s another company and stock that provides excellent AI-server industry exposure. So, you don\u2019t have to invest in a richly valued market darling like Super Micro Computer.\n\nDon\u2019t Sleep on These Announcements\n\nYou might not think that brief postings on X (formerly known as Twitter) could have much importance. However, three X postings could have major implications for the generative AI market and for Super Micro Computer.\n\nJust to provide some background info, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk heads an AI startup called xAI. This new company is developing Grok, an AI chatbot that\u2019s supposed to rival OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nNot long ago, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) CEO Michael Dell stunned the tech world when he posted on X, \u201cWe\u2019re building a Dell AI factory with @nvidia to power @grok for @xai @elonmusk.\u201d This posting quickly garnered millions of views.\n\nThat same day, Musk offered some clarification in an X posting. He wrote, \u201cTo be precise, Dell is assembling half the racks that are going into the supercomputer that xAI is building.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Musk stated in posting on X that \u201cSMC\u201d or Super Micro Computer will build the other half the AI-supercomputer racks.\n\nHence, you might be tempted to load up on Super Micro Computer stock right now. After all, an agreement with Musk is generally great news, and Super Micro Computer could benefit greatly if xAI and Grok are highly successful.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s Not-So-Super Valuation\n\nBear in mind, even before Dell\u2019s and Musk\u2019s aforementioned social media postings, Super Micro Computer was already a market darling. The company\u2019s valuation suggests that some investors already pinpointed Super Micro Computer as the \u201cnext\u201d Nvidia.\n\nLet\u2019s do a side-by-side comparison to support our point. Super Micro Computer\u2019s trailing 12-month GAAP price-to-earnings ratio is 46.18x. For reference, the sector median P/E ratio is 30.22x, and Dell Technologies\u2019 P/E ratio is 28.27x.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019d prefer to use the trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio as your valuation gauge. That\u2019s fine, as Super Micro Computer\u2019s P/S ratio is 3.8x, versus the sector median P/S ratio of 2.98x.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Dell has a P/S ratio of 1.1x. So now, we\u2019re starting to get the impression that maybe Super Micro Computer isn\u2019t the business involved in the Musk deal that investors should be focusing on.\n\nHere\u2019s a Better Bet Than Super Micro Computer Stock\n\nSuper Micro Computer certainly isn\u2019t an underdog in 2024. The financial press already gave Super Micro Computer plenty of press coverage, and stock traders have quickly bid up the company\u2019s stock price. In contrast, Dell Technologies appears to be just starting on its long-term comeback.\n\nBoth companies will benefit from their arrangement with Musk and xAI, no doubt. Still, it\u2019s understandable if valuation concerns might dissuade you from buying Super Micro Computer stock right now.\n\nInstead, investors ought to consider buying Dell stock today. They might also think about taking a share position in Super Micro Computer if the price comes down 20% or 30%.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The pursuit of financial freedom and a 6-figure net worth is a goal shared by many. While there are numerous investment strategies available, stocks for building wealth have long been a powerful tool for wealth creation.\n\nThe key to successful investing lies in identifying companies that demonstrate strong growth potential, solid financial health, and a competitive edge. However, approaching the market by investing in individual stocks is not the only prudent strategy. Investors can leverage investment vehicles like mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for a more passive approach. But if you\u2019re willing to get your hands dirty and put in some extra work, there is certainly potential to outperform the market in the long term.\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the top 3 stocks for building wealth to reach the 6-figure net worth milestone by 2030!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a global leader in high-performance, high-efficiency server and storage hardware. The company will be a beneficiary of artificial intelligence (AI) tailwinds, as its infrastructure is crucial to accelerate AI workloads in the cloud.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s growth potential is underpinned by the increasing demand for data storage and processing power. Its products are used in data centers, enterprise IT, artificial intelligence, and 5G infrastructure. As more businesses move their operations to cloud environments, the need for robust server solutions will continue to rise. The company continues to gain market share in 2024, and remains the preferred storage and server provider for hyperscale cloud providers. In Q3 FY24, revenue increased a whopping 200% year-over-year to $3.85 billion. Additionally, earnings per share also skyrocketed 328% YOY to $6.56 per share, driven by strong demand for AI rack scale solutions. With the rapid growth of data centers globally, SMCI stock stands as one of the best stocks for building wealth.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), a leading cybersecurity giant provides a comprehensive suite of products and services to protect organizations from cyber threats. Its offerings include firewall protection, advanced threat detection, and cloud security solutions.\n\nThe increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks have heightened the demand for robust cybersecurity measures. Hackers are getting more savvy, and are going after the largest organizations that have access to large amounts of sensitive data. One notable attack in 2024 is the ransomware attack on UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), in which they had to pay a $22 million ransom to hackers. This unfortunate occurrence will position Palo Alto for continued growth given its strong reputation in the industry. Moreover, Palo Alto has demonstrated strong financial performance, with strong double digit revenue growth and impressive free cash flow. In its latest quarterly financial results, revenue increased 15% YOY to $2 billion. Additionally, EPS swelled 155% year over year to 79 cents per share. This makes PANW stock one of the top stocks for building wealth through 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nGodaddy (GDDY) GoDaddy website\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGodaddy (NYSE:GDDY) has established itself as a global leader in domain registration and web hosting services. The company\u2019s recent inclusion in the S&P 500 Index and its growing earnings and free cash flow are a positive sign for the future.\n\nGodaddy empowers individuals and small businesses to build an online presence. The company is no longer a one trick pony, as it has expanded its product offerings over the years. This includes website builders, e-commerce solutions, and digital marketing solutions for online business needs. Moreover, Godaddy\u2019s new Airo platform includes a full suite of AI tools for businesses. After delivering record revenue, earnings, and free cash flow in FY23, CEO Aman Bhutani continues to execute on strategic priorities. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue increased 7% YOY to $1.1 billion. Additionally, net earnings skyrocketed 749% year over year to $401.5 million, or $2.76 per share. Godaddy\u2019s focus on operational efficiency is steadfast, placing GDDY stock among the best growth stocks for building wealth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Turbocharged Growth Stocks Set to Soar 1,000% by 2026",
        "content": "Growth stocks are needle-movers of the broader stock market these days, so it is essential for your portfolio to have exposure to them. Anyone not keeping a pulse on growth stocks is likely underperforming the market by a good margin or losing out entirely.\n\nThat said, most growth stocks right now are trading at nosebleed valuations. These stocks have significant downside potential if the market decides to correct, and their upside potential is driven a lot by the broader market\u2019s momentum. However, there are many outliers, and I think many of them can deliver multibagger returns from their current valuations in the coming years. Here are seven to look into:\n\nSprout Social (SPT) hands holding smartphone with social media icons floating above it. brick wall background. Social Media Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSprout Social (NASDAQ:SPT) provides a platform for businesses to manage their social media presence. While the stock has been battered lately after a recent revenue miss, I believe the selloff is overdone, and Sprout Social remains poised for explosive growth ahead. It is now down around 75% from its peak.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn Q1 2024, Sprout delivered 28.7% year-over-year revenue growth to $96.8 million. The company also swung to profitability, posting adjusted EPS of 10 cents, which crushed estimates by 9 cents. However, its full-year 2024 outlook was mixed, with adjusted EPS of 45-46 cents, beating expectations but revenue guidance of $405-$406 million, slightly missing the $425.6 million consensus.\n\nDespite the near-term hiccup, I\u2019m convinced Sprout\u2019s best days lie ahead. People spend more time on social media than ever, and Sprout is perfectly positioned to help companies maximize their presence. The company\u2019s robust platform and AI capabilities give it a major competitive edge.\n\nAlthough growth may moderate temporarily, analysts still expect Sprout\u2019s earnings to quadruple between 2024 and 2028. With that level of profit expansion on tap, I believe Sprout could be a multibagger by 2026, even with a muted valuation multiple.\n\nShift4 Payments (FOUR) Illustration of phone with dollar sign and other graphics symbolizing fintech displayed on and around it, with a blue background. Fintech Stock Bargains. fintech stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ZinetroN\n\nShift4 Payments (NYSE:FOUR) is a leading provider of integrated payment processing and technology solutions. While the company missed on both revenue and earnings in Q1, I believe the long-term growth story remains intact.\n\nRevenue grew an impressive 29.32% YOY to $707.4 million, even though it fell short of estimates by $43.6 million. Shift4 is one of the fastest-growing fintech companies out there, with a three-year revenue CAGR of over 50%. Analysts are projecting a robust 41% sales growth for the full year 2024.\n\nStory continues turbocharged growth stocks: FOUR revenue chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe earnings miss of 8 cents, with EPS coming in at 54 cents, is certainly disappointing. However, most fintech stocks are trading at depressed valuations in the current market environment, and I believe Shift4 is no exception. The company has been aggressively pursuing M&A, spending over $1 billion on acquisitions since 2021. This has resulted in goodwill ballooning.\n\nWhile this M&A strategy does introduce some risk, it\u2019s also been a major growth driver. Shift4\u2019s three-year total asset CAGR stands at an impressive 23.51%. In my view, the market is not giving the company enough credit for its strong growth trajectory.\n\nSnap Inc (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) operates as a camera and social media company. In my view, SNAP stock is one of the most underestimated names in the market right now, and it has explosive potential ahead.\n\nI believe Snap is poised for a major recovery, similar to the impressive turnaround META pulled off from 2022 to today. That\u2019s because Snap has been rapidly improving its fundamentals and has substantial room to boost profits going forward.\n\nRevenue growth accelerated to an impressive 21% YOY in Q1, up sharply from just 5% the prior quarter. Meanwhile, Snap\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) has remained relatively stagnant for years \u2013 but that\u2019s precisely why I see immense untapped potential here. SNAP EPS estimates chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWe could witness an explosive comeback if Snapchat can successfully grow this key ARPU metric and drive earnings higher in the coming years. Snap\u2019s brand-safe environment and continued ad platform innovation position it well to capture rising demand.\n\nBesides, you should consider the looming possibility of a TikTok ban. Given the significant audience overlap between the two platforms, this could drive floods of Gen Z and Millennial users onto Snapchat.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) makes servers and storage solutions for data centers. The company is at the forefront of the AI revolution, and its stock could potentially soar much higher if the AI mania continues. In Q3 2024, Supermicro achieved record-breaking revenue of $3.85 billion, a staggering 200% increase YOY. Non-GAAP earnings per share also skyrocketed 308% to $6.65.\n\nThese impressive results reflect the strong demand for Supermicro\u2019s plug-and-play AI solutions. CEO Charles Liang highlighted that the company continues to face some supply chain challenges due to new products requiring key components. However, the AI tailwinds appear to be overpowering these headwinds for now.\n\nSupermicro\u2019s stock has been consolidating for about four months after an explosive rally. I believe if the AI hype train keeps chugging along, we could see the stock break out to new highs. The valuation of 35 times forward earnings and three times sales is not excessive for a company growing at a triple-digit pace.\n\nThat said, investors should be aware that much of Supermicro\u2019s upside potential is tethered to the sustainability of the AI boom. The stock could face a steep selloff if the AI narrative shifts or interest fades. But for now, I believe the risk/reward looks attractive for this AI hardware pure play.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) ecommerce company nogin, NOGN stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) operates a B2B e-commerce platform connecting suppliers and retailers of large parcel products. Despite its misleading name, this company\u2019s business is growing at a breakneck pace, putting even many cloud companies to shame. In Q1 2024, GigaCloud nearly doubled its revenue YOY to $251 million, marking its fifth consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nWhat\u2019s powering this explosive trajectory? GigaCloud\u2019s highly robust technology suite transforms how B2B buyers and sellers of oversized items connect and transact globally. Its supplier-filled retail model streamlines the entire supply chain journey. Strategic acquisitions of Noble House and Wondersign are further diversifying GigaCloud\u2019s already impressive product and service offerings.\n\nGCT stock has delivered a blistering 339% return over the past year, although shares have traded sideways since February. I believe GigaCloud could be poised for another major breakout if it continues to prove to investors that it can maintain this growth pace.\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) provides financial services and mobile payments solutions for businesses and individuals. The company just reported impressive Q1 2024 results, with EPS of 85 cents, beating estimates by 12 cents, and revenue of $5.96 billion, surging 19.4% YOY.\n\nBlock is one of the fastest-growing fintech companies in the market, and its depressed valuation looks too compelling to pass up at current levels. Despite drastically improving its fundamentals, SQ stock has traded sideways over the past two years. SQ revenue EPS estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nEPS is projected to double within the next four years. You\u2019re essentially paying a mere 12 times 2026 estimated earnings at the current stock price.\n\nMoreover, Cash App achieved 49% year-over-year gross profit growth, driven by strong momentum in Cash Card. With Cash App\u2019s MAUs reaching 57 million, I believe there\u2019s still a massive runway ahead for further monetization.\n\nThe stock won\u2019t stay undervalued for long, as the market eventually realizes this fintech juggernaut\u2019s immense profit potential.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) designs and manufactures premium smart electric vehicles in China. This company was on fire just a year ago, smashing earnings estimates and rewarding workers for outperforming delivery targets. However, the tables have turned swiftly for Li Auto in 2024. The stock has plummeted 44% year-to-date after the company lowered delivery guidance and missed Q1 estimates, with EPS of 17 cents falling short of expectations by 3 cents. Revenue also disappointed, coming in at $3.54 billion and missing projections by over $250 million despite still growing an impressive 30.75% YOY.\n\nWhile the near-term picture looks grim, I believe the intense selling pressure on LI stock has been overdone. This company remains one of the most popular EV brands in China and recently posted strong delivery numbers that hint at a potential turnaround. Li Auto delivered 47,774 vehicles in June, up 46.7% compared to last year. This brought Q2 deliveries to 108,581, a 25.5% YOY increase. As of June 30, Li\u2019s cumulative deliveries reached 822,345 vehicles, ranking it first among emerging Chinese EV makers.\n\nI\u2019m optimistic that Li Auto could engineer a significant rebound. The company is insulated from Chinese EV tariffs and has ambitious international expansion plans. If Li can continue executing and regain its prior momentum, the stock looks poised for a sharp recovery.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Up 194.5% YTD: Is it Worth Buying?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer SMCI shares have skyrocketed 194.5% year to date, outpacing the Zacks Computer \u2013 Storage Devices industry and S&P 500 index, which have returned 84.3% and 16.1%, respectively. This impressive performance can be largely attributed to the company's solid position in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure market, which as per a Precedence Research report, is expected to witness a CAGR of 27.5% from 2024 to 2033.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer has been capitalizing on the current AI boom on the back of robust demand for its server and storage solutions. Especially, growing OEM component orders are leading to a spike in the uptake of its AI servers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, its diversified business model, which encompasses Graphics Processing Units (GPU), AI, core computing, storage, 5G, edge computing and Internet of Things solutions, is helping the stock grow.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer remains optimistic about its robust pipeline of new products as well as existing products. It raised its guidance for fiscal 2024 revenue from fiscal year from $14.3-$14.7 billion to $14.7-$15.1 billion in its third-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SMCI\u2019s fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $14.93 billion, indicating 109.7% growth year over year.\r\n\r\nThe company expects fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $23.29-$24.09. The consensus mark for the same is pegged at $23.82, which has been stable over the past 30 days. The estimate indicates growth of 101.7% year over year.\n\nSMCI Year-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong Portfolio Aids Prospects\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s solid traction across top-tier data centers, emerging cloud service providers, enterprise/channel and edge/IoT/telecom customers, owing to its robust Total IT solutions portfolio is driving its prospects.\n\nStrength in Total IT Solutions Super Micro Computer\n\nImage Source: Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer is at the forefront of the current AI revolution. It is riding on its diversified AI portfolio and strong AI integrations into its storage systems.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that AI is accelerating the need for liquid cooling, Super Micro Computer has invested heavily in high-quality, optimized Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) solutions for high-end applications.\r\n\r\nIt has recently added three new manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley to support the growth of AI and enterprise rack-scale liquid-cooled solutions and capitalize on the rising demand for liquid-cooled data centers.\r\n\r\nThe company is experiencing solid adoption of its Rack-Scale PnP Total AI solutions, which is contributing well to its server and storage revenues. It expects 5,000 racks capacity per month by the end of this year. Super Micro Computer is currently on track to produce more than two thousand DLC racks per month of AI servers, with production volumes ramping up steadily.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across its H100-based systems and AI inferencing systems is another positive.\n\nStory continues\n\nPartnerships Drive Momentum\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s strategic partnerships with NVIDIA NVDA, Intel INTC and Advanced Micro Devices AMD are playing a vital role in driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nIn fiscal 2023, Super Micro Computer announced more than 50 products supporting Intel\u2019s new Sapphire Rapids data center CPU. Its product portfolio was also enhanced to support AMD\u2019s Genoa data center CPU.\r\n\r\nSMCI\u2019s robust portfolio of infrastructure solutions for 5G and telecom workloads, on the back of its strong partnership with NVIDIA, remains a major positive. It is also benefiting from strong momentum across the NVIDIA GPU product lines.\r\n\r\nMany Super Micro Computer servers are explicitly designed for high-performance NVIDIA GPUs for AI processing, such as the very high-density 4U-8GPU systems, the Intel CPU-based SYS-421GE-TNHR2-LCC, and the AMD CPU-based AS -4125GS-TNHR2-LCC.\r\n\r\nTo further capitalize on the growing proliferation of AI, Super Micro Computer has deployed NVIDIA HGX H100 SuperCluster solutions to deliver enhanced experience to its customers.\r\n\r\nThe company recently unveiled Rack Scale Plug-and-Play Liquid-Cooled AI SuperClusters for NVIDIA Blackwell and NVIDIA HGX H100/H200. By optimizing with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, SMCI strives to offer global manufacturing capacity with world-class efficiency to customers across various industries.\r\n\r\nSMCI is now deepening its focus on developing new generative AI and inference-optimized systems based on the next-generation NVIDIA H200, B100, B200, GH200 and GB200 GPUs, as well as Intel\u2019s Gaudi2/3 and Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 MI300X/A GPUs.\n\nConclusion\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s long-term prospects are likely to benefit from its significant investments in production, operations, management software, AI portfolio, cloud features and customer service, which are expected to bolster its customer base in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nHowever, near-term macroeconomic uncertainties and supply chain challenges, especially in DLC-related components, remain concerns for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Increasing competition from original design manufacturers like Foxconn, Quanta Computer, and Wiwynn, among others, poses a threat to SMCI\u2019s market position. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nMoreover, SMCI is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 35.02X compared with the industry\u2019s 22.2X and higher than the median of 27.27X, reflecting a stretched valuation. Hence, investors looking to buy the stock should wait for a better entry point.\n\nSMCI\u2019s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 3, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Vertiv VRT, Super Micro Computer SMCI and Eaton ETN.\n\nReap Data Center Gains with These 3 Stocks\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) remains a hot market topic, with investors continuing to seek ways to obtain exposure. The theme has undoubtedly been one of the strongest we've seen in years, with many stocks benefiting, namely large-cap technology.\n\nAnd for those seeking exposure, particularly concerning the data center angle, several stocks, including Vertiv, Super Micro Computer and Eaton, provide just that.\n\nFor those with an appetite for AI exposure through the data center angle, let's take a closer look at each.\n\nVertiv Raises Outlook\n\nVertiv provides services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial facilities with a portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services. The stock sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the revisions trend notably positive for its current fiscal year.\n\nShares yield a modest 0.1% annually, undoubtedly on the lower end of the spectrum. Nonetheless, the company's cash-generating abilities have seen a boost amid heightened demand, providing it the flexibility to potentially increase payouts in the future. Adjusted free cash flow of $101 million throughout its latest quarter jumped 300% year-over-year.\n\nThe company's growth profile remains bright, underpinned by its Style Score of 'A' for Growth. Consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggest 38% EPS growth on 13% higher sales, with next year's expectations suggesting an additional 30% earnings growth on a 12% sales bump.\n\nVertiv upped its current year sales outlook following its latest set of quarterly results, further confirming the robust demand being witnessed.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Posts Strong Sales Growth\n\nSuper Micro Computer is the premier provider of advanced Server Building Block Solutions for 5G/Edge, Data Center, Cloud, Enterprise, Big Data, HPC, and Embedded markets worldwide. The company's earnings outlook remains bullish, helping the stock find its way back into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nShares trade at an elevated 34.6X forward 12-month earnings multiple, reflective of investors' high growth expectations. The company is expected to deliver just that, as Zacks Consensus estimates for its current fiscal year suggest 100% EPS growth on 11% higher sales.\n\nSMCI's sales growth has been remarkable, posting triple-digit percentage year-over-year growth rates in back-to-back releases.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares have faced a bumpy road over the last three months, losing roughly 20% compared to a +5.9% gain from the S&P 500. The adverse price action likely reflects some profit-taking after an unbelievable run, with its current bullish earnings outlook set to provide the fuel needed to regain its mojo.\n\nEaton Reports Quarterly Records\n\nEaton is an intelligent power management company that provides products for the data center, utility, industrial, commercial, machine building, residential, aerospace, and mobility markets. The stock sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting positively across the board.\n\nConcerning its latest quarterly release, Eaton posted EPS of $2.40 and sales of $5.9 billion, which reflected Q1 records for the company. Notably, its twelve-month rolling average of orders in Q1 was up 8% organically, with highlighted strength in the data center market.\n\nFor those with an appetite for income, shares currently yield 1.2% annually, with the company's 5.4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate also reflecting a shareholder-friendly nature. It's worth noting that Eaton recently boosted its quarterly payout by 9% back in March of this year, and impressively, the company has paid a dividend on its shares every year since 1923.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe AI trade continues to grip investors, with many seeking exposure. It's easy to understand why there's such excitement surrounding the topic, as the technology is expected to boost productivity and provide meaningful operational efficiencies for businesses.\n\nAnd for those interested in the data center angle, all three stocks above deserve a watchlist spot.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Are you wondering how fast you can turn a $1,000 investment into a million? Three years? Five years? The Rule of 72 tells us that at a 20% CAGR (which is already outstanding), it would take almost 39 years. The real question is, which stocks do you need to get there? If we consider how the market has moved, it\u2019s clear that high-potential tech stocks offer some of the fastest growth due to the nature of most businesses.\n\nSo, today, we will look at the tech stocks that have the potential to help turn $1,000 into $1M. To get my list, I used the criteria below:\n\nBuy a rating from analysts, Positive YTD price percent change, Positive growth in earnings and revenue in the last annual report.\n\nI then sorted my list based on the highest to lowest YTD performance. This ensures that I capitalize on the leaders with the qualities to sustain them in the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd so, here are my results.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeing at the forefront of the AI revolution raises investor expectations. We have a Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The company\u2019s enterprise-level application-optimized servers and long-standing partnership with Nvidia as a provider of AI servers have significantly fueled its recent growth and investor hopes.\n\nThe company has significantly benefitted from the current boom with the continued development and adoption of AI, IoT, and cloud computing. Super Micro recently announced that it would be adding three new facilities in Silicon Valley to support this growth further.\n\nSuper Micro\u2019s Q3\u201924 financials reported strong numbers. Net sales significantly increased to $3.85 billion from $1.28 billion YOY, and EPS hit $7.13 from a mere $1.61. If things continue to go as most investors expect, we could see a follow-through from its FY\u201923 record revenue growth of 37% and 127% in EPS YOY.\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that SMCI stock is up 187.04% YTD and has a consensus strong buy rating.\n\nIf you want to jump onto the AI boom with high-potential tech stocks, then SMCI is for you.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nA leader in nanomanufacturing solutions, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a tech company that specializes in three main segments:\n\nApplied Global Services: provides optimization and performance solutions via upgrades, automation software and other products. Semiconductor Systems: offers equipment used for integrated circuits and semiconductor chip making. Display and Adjacent Markets: LCD, OLED and display manufacturing technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is currently expanding its portfolio of patterning solutions to address the requirements of the \u201cAngstrom era\u201d chips.\n\nApplied Materials also reported decent numbers on its Q2\u201924 financials. Its revenue remained stable at around $6.65 billion YOY, while its quarterly EPS increased 11% to $2.06.\n\nThe company remains optimistic about Q3FY\u201924, projecting revenue of approximately $6.65 billion and EPS from $1.83 to $2.19. This forecast aligns with the company\u2019s consistent growth trajectory, shown by its 3% YOY revenue increase and 9% earnings growth in FFY23\n\nAltogether, AMAT stock is up 52.87% YTD, and analysts continue to rate it as a strong buy thanks to the demand for AI, IoT, and electric vehicle demand. Applied Materials presents an opportunity worth exploring for investors seeking high-potential tech stocks to turn $1,000 into $1,000,000.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top tech firms in infrastructure software and semiconductor solutions, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) offers its enterprise clients various cyber security, distributed software, and product licenses. Its acquisition of the software company VMWare has increased its footprint even further as an enterprise software provider.\n\nThe company is seeing positive momentum in gaining more partners through its Broadcom Advantage Partner Program for VMware Cloud Service Providers.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s Q2\u201924 financials rewarded its investors with another impressive quarter. Revenue was 43% higher YOY, driven by strong AI demand and VMware adoption. The company also reported a net income of $2.1 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of $7.4 billion.\n\nThis strong performance has compelled the company to raise this year\u2019s expected revenue to $51 billion. At the same time, adjusted EBITDA is projected at 61% of revenue.\n\nGiven Broadcom\u2019s outstanding outlook and performance, it is no surprise that Wall Street analysts consistently rate the company as a strong buy. Such remarkable performance rightfully commands the attention of investors alike. AVGO stock is up 47.92% YTD, making it one of the best high-potential tech stocks today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "How This Chip Company Outperformed Nvidia in the First Half",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is in full swing, and the big winner of that revolution is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nWell, maybe it's the second-biggest.\n\nNvidia is no doubt the most-in-focus company in the world right now. Its GPUs are in hyper-demand as companies race to deploy AI. Certainly, Nvidia has been the biggest winner of the popular \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nHowever, one AI beneficiary actually outpaced Nvidia in the first half to lead the entire S&P 500 index.\n\nSuper Micro Computer rides Nvidia's coattails to lead the market\n\nThe best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year wasn't Nvidia, but rather Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Supermicro returned a whopping 188% in the first half of the year, versus just 150% for Nvidia, dividends included. Not only that, but while Nvidia ended the quarter near year-to-date highs, Supermicro was actually significantly higher earlier in the half, reaching a year-to-date gain as large as 331% at one point in mid-March! SMCI Year to Date Total Returns (Daily) Chart\n\nHow did Supermicro pull it off? It's actually for the same reasons Nvidia continued to take off: torrid artificial intelligence-related growth. Actually, one could say Supermicro, as a server-maker, rode a growth wave on Nvidia's back, as demand for Supermicro's AI servers, which make up over 50% of its revenue and mostly contain Nvidia GPUs, took off. So Supermicro's AI-fueled growth was likely due to essentially reselling Nvidia chips, with a small markup, indicated by Supermicro's relatively low 15.5% gross margins last quarter.\n\nNvidia also actually posted higher revenue growth than Supermicro, at 262% growth in Q2, versus \"just\" 200% growth for Super Micro Computer last quarter.\n\nHowever, the stock market isn't always exactly correlated with financial results, as we've seen. So, now did Supermicro's stock manage to pull off such a feat? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStarting from a lower valuation\n\nWhile business performance over the long term is the key determinant of long-term performance, valuation also matters, especially in the short-term. And as we can see, Supermicro was starting from a much lower valuation this year.\n\nOn Jan. 1, Supermicro traded around 25 times earnings, while Nvidia traded at 65 times earnings. Yet during the quarter, Supermicro's valuation expanded to around 45 times earnings -- an 80% increase -- while Nvidia's P/E ratio expanded to 72 -- a mere 8% increase. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nMeanwhile, both companies saw their future earnings estimates rise, and by roughly the same amount through the first half, with each stock seeing its forward earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts one year out increasing by about 80% to 90%.\n\nStory continues SMCI EPS GAAP Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe earnings estimate increases were driven by stellar earnings and expectations from both companies during the quarter. Supermicro's estimates got a big boost early in the year when it greatly increased its forward guidance on its February earnings call. And while earnings estimates continued to rise even after its May 1 earnings report, the stock sold off. This was perhaps due to the prior quarter setting such a high bar of expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia continued to rise as torrid growth posted in both February and May continued to defy the skeptics. However, as the company was already suffering from high expectations coming into the year, it didn't rally quite as much after its February earnings, leaving \"room\" to surprise after its May earnings.\n\nThus, the outperformance from Supermicro largely comes down to starting expectations.\n\nValuation matters\n\nTrying to parse any lesson here is really splitting hairs, as both stocks have outperformed handily, and for the same reasons. However, one lesson to draw is that valuation matters. If a company is a great company but already trades at a high valuation, it may not rise as much as a company that might not be quite as good, but is able to outperform starting expectations by a greater degree.\n\nThink of it like a point spread in football. Market valuations are essentially \"point spreads\" on stocks. You only win a bet if your team wins the game and beats the point spread. Similarly, if your team loses but by less than others think, you still win the bet.\n\nOne of the greatest growth investors of all time, Phil Fisher, once said, \"Every significant price move of any individual common stock in relation to stocks as a whole occurs because of a changed appraisal of that stock by the financial community.\"\n\nAs AI enthusiasm takes hold and many tech stocks climb to very high valuations, this is something to keep in mind as expectations seem to have gone higher and higher for AI winners this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

Sales growth is forecasted to remain robust, with the $14.9 billion Zacks Consensus Sales estimate for its current fiscal year suggesting a 110% climb year-over-year.\n\nCharles Liang, CEO of Supermicro, was positive on the latest set of results, stating, \"Strong demand for AI rack scale PnP solutions, along with our team's ability to develop innovative DLC designs, enabled us to expand our market leadership in AI infrastructure. As new solutions ramp, including fully production ready DLC, we expect to continue gaining market share. As such, we are raising our fiscal year 2024 revenue outlook from $14.3 to $14.7 billion to a new range of $14.7 to $15.1 billion.\"\n\nRevenue expectations moved accordingly following the release, up a staggering 94% overall over the last year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank \u2013 one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.\n\nThe top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.\n\nSuper Micro Computer would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance is a retail drugstore chain that sells prescription and non-prescription drugs. The company also sells general merchandise products, including household items, convenience and fresh foods, personal care, beauty care, photofinishing, and candy.\n\nAnalysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's outlook, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nIn addition, the company is in the Zacks Retail \u2013 Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 1% of all Zacks industries.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the company.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance\n\nWBA shares have faced consistent pressure year-to-date, down more than 50% and widely underperforming. A recent set of weak quarterly results caused a post-earnings share plunge, with the company falling short of EPS expectations but delivering a modest sales beat.\n\nWBA lowered its outlook following the release, explaining the knee-jerk reaction that followed.\n\nCEO Tim Wentworth acknowledged the weaker-than-expected results, stating, \"We continue to face a difficult operating environment, including persistent pressures on the U.S. consumer and the impact of recent marketplace dynamics which have eroded pharmacy margins. Our results and outlook reflect these headwinds, despite solid performance in both our International and U.S. Healthcare segments.\"\n\nShares yield 8.3% annually now following the steep decline, though it's critical to note that investors should remain on the sidelines until the company's earnings picture shifts positively and it provides further guidance on its strategic initiatives.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMargin pressures and lowered guidance paint a challenging picture for the company's shares in the near term.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook.\n\nFor those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) \u2013 these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nTotal U.S. Drilling Rig Tally Falls: Here's What It Means\n\nIn its weekly release,\u00a0Baker Hughes Co. stated that the U.S. rig count was lower than the prior week's figure. The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.\n\nBaker Hughes' data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the week-ago figure indicates the demand trajectory for the company's oilfield services from exploration and production companies.\n\nRig Count Data in Detail\n\nTotal U.S. Rig Count Falls: The number of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 581 in the week ended Jun 28, lower than the week-ago count of 588. The current national rig count also declined from the year-ago level of 674, reflecting the fact that there has been a slowdown in drilling activities. Some analysts see this downside as a sign of increased efficiency among shale producers, who may need fewer rigs. However, there are doubts among a few about whether certain producers have sufficient promising land for drilling.\n\nOnshore rigs in the week that ended on Jun 28 totaled 560, lower than the prior week's count of 567. In offshore resources, 21 rigs were operating, which was flat with the week-ago count.\n\nU.S. Oil Rig Count Declines: The oil rig count was 479 in the week ended Jun 28, lower than the week-ago figure of 485. The current number of oil rigs \u2014 far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 \u2014 was also down from the year-ago figure of 545.\n\nU.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Falls: The natural gas rig count of 97 was lower than the week-ago figure of 98. The count of rigs exploring the commodity was also below the year-ago week's tally of 124. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 94% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.\n\nRig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 18 units, lower than the week-ago count of 19. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 563 was down from the prior-week level of 569.\n\nRig Count in the Most Prolific Basin\n\nPermian \u2014 the most prolific basin in the United States \u2014 recorded a weekly oil and gas rig count of 305, which was lower than the week-ago figure of 308. The count is also below the prior-year level of 341.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $80-per-barrel mark, highly favorable for exploration and production operations. Although the commodity pricing scenario is handsome, there has been a slowdown in drilling activities, which may continue as upstream players are prioritizing stockholder returns rather than boosting output.\n\nAmid the backdrop, investors seeking medium to long-term gains may keep an eye on energy stocks like Diamondback Energy, Inc. and Matador Resources Co..\n\nDiamondback Energy, a leading pure-play Permian operator, reported ongoing enhancements in the average productivity per well in the Midland Basin. The exploration and production company expects to maintain growth in production volumes, benefiting from favorable commodity pricing conditions. FANG, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), also has an investment-grade balance sheet. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nMatador Resources recently entered into a $1.91 billion agreement to expand its footprint in the prolific Delaware Basin. With the deal expected to close in the late third quarter of 2024, the #3 Ranked company is projected to have more than 190,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin on a pro forma basis. Consequently, the company estimates that its production will exceed 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, positioning it for significant growth and enhanced operational scale.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "3 Mega-Cap Chip Stocks That Could Make Major Moves Soon",
        "content": "We all know that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top choice among for investors looking at chip stocks in this market. However, this company is far from the only company that stands to benefit from AI-related tailwinds and surging long-term demand expectations.\n\nPlenty of other chip stocks have emerged as beneficiaries of the recent hype. And as AI technology improves daily, more infrastructure is needed to support the developers and corporations building the applications.\n\nFor those looking at mega-cap chip stocks, and other related companies that could benefit from these trends, examine three stocks worth keeping an eye on now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper MicroComputer (NASDAQ:SMCI), a leader in IT solutions for AI, Cloud, Storage and 5G/Edge, is expanding in Silicon Valley to meet rising demand for liquid-cooled data centers. The goal of the company\u2019s new campuses is to streamline global delivery of plug-and-play liquid-cooled solutions. This will enhance AI workload capabilities while cutting energy use and operational costs significantly.\n\nThe management team continues to emphasize SMCI\u2019s cutting-edge generative deep learning and AI inference platforms, enhanced by liquid-cooled technology. With rising interest in energy-efficient Direct Liquid-Cooled solutions, Super Micro Computer to innovates with its modular systems for AI and HPC industries. The company foresees liquid-cooled data centers increasing from historically minimal levels to 15%\u201330% of all installations within two years. This will position SMCI as a leader with superior efficiency and lower operational expenses versus conventional air-cooled setups.\n\nThe company saw its stock price soar nearly fourfold in the past year on strong growth in data center products. In Q3 of 2024, revenue reached $3.9 billion and net income $402 million. For Q4 of 2024, the market expects a $5.1 billion revenue, with a full year revenue projection of $14.7 billion.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) An AMD sign on a CPU package. AMD Stock\n\nSource: Tobias Arhelger / Shutterstock.com\n\nChallenging Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) comes in second in the AI chip market. AMD is also turning into a giant AI semiconductor company. It is gaining trust from other big tech companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This led to an 80% increase in data center revenue last March. The growth stems from an emerging AI product lineup.\n\nRecently, AMD launched its MI325X AI accelerator chip, offering 30% more bandwidth and double the memory of comparable Nvidia products. AMD plans to match Nvidia\u2019s pace in releasing next-gen AI tech.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf tempted to buy shares of this underappreciated growth company, down over 30% from its March high, analysts support your choice. With a consensus price target of $190.02\u201420% above the current price\u201435 of 49 analysts rate it a strong buy. Expect volatility and potentially more downside, but the company\u2019s long-term potential remains promising. I think at current levels, AMD stock presents a significant opportunity.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother crucial AI player is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). The company has enabled Nvidia to produce powerful chips. In fact, Nvidia\u2019s Hopper uses TSM\u2019s 4N process and its Blackwell AI processors will use the 4NP process. Aside from that, IntelCorporation (NASDAQ:INTC) plans to use TSM\u2019s 3mm line for their notebook processes.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, INTC manufactures its own chips. But, it has fallen behind in developing advanced ones, thus relying on TSMC. Advancing toward 2nm process nodes, Taiwan Semiconductor continues to see high demand from Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm and other mega-cap tech companies. This demand continues to spur high factory utilization rates. Further, it\u2019s likely continue to do so over the long-term.\n\nThe market expects more growth from TSM stock, projecting a 21% increase by 2029. The company\u2019s earning per share growth estimates are very optimistic, with analysts expecting a 23% and 25% increase for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Given the big potential in AI, Taiwan Semiconductor is a company long-term investors may want to consider right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Down 33% from its 52-week high, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock is a screaming buy at current levels.\n\nDespite the pullback and volatility seen in SMCI stock during the just completed second quarter, the company\u2019s share price is up 188% year to date, making it the best performing stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nNot even Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has performed better than Super Micro Computer. Making the gains even more impressive is the fact that Super Micro Computer\u2019s stock only joined the S&P 500 on March 18 this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer was added to the benchmark index following a rally that saw its share price increase tenfold over the past 18 months. At the start of 2023, SMCI stock was trading for less than $85 per share.\n\nToday, the stock is changing hands at $820. While the share price has pulled back from its all-time high of $1,229 reached in March shortly after joining the S&P 500, it likely won\u2019t be long before the stock is rallying again.\n\nExceptional Growth\n\nSuper Micro Computer makes data centers that power artificial intelligence models and applications. To say that the company\u2019s products are in high demand is an understatement.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s market capitalization has soared from $4.50 billion at the end of 2022 to $45 billion today as its sales and profits have grown exponentially.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials and its stock really took off in spring 2023 after the company announced a strategic partnership with leading AI microchip designer Nvidia.\n\nFor this year\u2019s first quarter, Super Micro Computer reported 200% annualized revenue growth and raised its forward guidance. It\u2019s a sign of how lofty expectations have gotten around the company and its stock that the 200% sales growth missed Wall Street\u2019s targets.\n\nHigh Expectations for SMCI Stock\n\nThe maker of high-efficiency servers reported first-quarter EPS of $6.65 compared to $5.78 that was expected among analysts.\n\nRevenue for Q1 came in at $3.85 billion, up 200% year-over-year, but still below the $3.95 billion consensus expectation on the Street. In the previous fourth quarter of 2023, Super Micro Computer reported 103% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nThe company raised its forward guidance, saying it now expects fiscal 2024 revenue of $14.70 billion to $15.10 billion, up from a previous outlook of $14.30 billion to $14.70 billion. The new guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 582% at the midpoint.\n\nAnalysts had expected fiscal 2024 revenue of $14.60 billion. Management noted on their earnings call that some supply chain issues they encountered earlier this year have improved and should be better moving forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore Upside Ahead\n\nAnalysts largely remain bullish on Super Micro Computer stock.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Super Micro Computer Stock Now?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), a company that's been around for 30 years, soared into the spotlight only in recent times. The company makes equipment such as servers, workstations, and full rack scale solutions -- and these and other items are in high demand thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) customers.\n\nAs a result, earnings went from slow progression several years ago to high growth over the past few years. And Supermicro's share performance followed, soaring more than 4,000% in just five years. The S&P 500 even invited Supermicro into the index in the first half of the year -- proof the company has made it into the elite group of players driving growth.\n\nSo Supermicro has become pretty successful, but considering the steep share price gains, is it too late to invest in the stock now? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGrowing faster than its industry\n\nFirst, let's take a look at how Supermicro's business took off as the AI boom accelerated. A key reason for the company's growth, which has been more than five times faster than its industry over the past 12 months, has to do with its ability to quickly deliver customized products to customers.\n\nSupermicro does this by working hand in hand with the world's top chip designers, including Nvidia, so that when they launch a new chip, Supermicro can immediately integrate it into its products. Also, the company's products use many of the same components, making it easy and fast to build new systems and tailor a platform to a customer's needs.\n\nThis has helped Supermicro grow revenue from about $3 billion in 2021 to that amount in just one quarter earlier this year. Return on invested capital also has soared, showing the company is benefiting from its investments. SMCI Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nLooking ahead, there's reason to believe Supermicro's growth and popularity among customers will continue, for a few reasons. The company has seen sustained record demand for its full rack scale solutions incorporating chips from Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices. Nvidia's upcoming launch of its new Blackwell architecture and other releases from these companies should keep this momentum going.\n\nA new growth driver\n\nAnd Supermicro's development of direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology may finally pay off. The intense operations in AI data centers generate high levels of heat, and this problem is set to worsen as the technology accelerates. DLC addresses the issue, which means Supermcro's work in this area could offer it a new growth driver.\n\nAbout 15% of racks shipped this year will include DLC, and that will increase to 30% next year, The Register reported, citing a speech by Supermicro CEO Charles Liang at the Computex event. And here too, Supermicro is able to achieve the speed customers like. Liang said lead time on orders has declined to two to four weeks -- that's down from as much as a year, according to the newspaper.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Supermicro has ramped up manufacturing, adding, for example, a new facility in Malaysia focused on high volume at a lower cost structure. The addition of this site will increase the company's total revenue capacity to beyond $20 billion.\n\nToo late to buy?\n\nNow, let's get back to our question: Is it too late to get in on Supermicro after its enormous gain in recent years? A look at valuation shows us that Supermicro trades for 34x forward earnings estimates, down from a peak of more than 45 earlier this year.\n\nIt's also important to consider that the AI market is forecast to grow to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade, up from about $200 billion today. This implies we're still in the early stages of the AI story.\n\nSo, yes, if you bought shares of Supermicro a few years ago, you made a great move. But if you didn't, it isn't too late to benefit from this company's growth -- because there's likely a lot more ahead, considering all the points I mention. And that's why Supermicro still makes a fantastic AI growth buy for the long-term investor right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Top S&amp;P 500 Stocks With Room to Run: SMCI, NVDA, MU",
        "content": "Wall Street rallied in the first half of 2024, driven by an artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy and a less hawkish Federal Reserve.\n\nA blistering rally among tech stocks led by Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Micron Technology, Inc. MU helped the broader S&P 500 to close in the green in the first two quarters and squash recession fearmongering.\n\nS&P 500 Notches Double-Digit Gains\n\nThe S&P 500 scaled northward in the first half of 2024 and ended tantalizingly close to its all-time closing high. The S&P 500 was just 0.5% below its record close on June 18 in the last trading session. However, the index climbed more than 4% in the second quarter, following a superb gain of 10.2% in the first three months.\n\nThe S&P 500 soared 11.3% in the first half, significantly more than its historical average gain of 4.7% since 1953, per Bespoke Investment Group. In comparison, the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded a paltry gain of 3.5%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Propelled the S&P 500 Higher?\n\nThe S&P 500 shrugged off apprehensions about geopolitical turmoil and pricey valuations. Instead, the index rallied on interest rate cut optimism and an AI boom.\n\nInflationary pressure loosened its tight grip on the economy, with the Fed\u2019s favored inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, remaining unchanged in May, a tell-tale sign that price pressures are receding.\n\nTherefore, it is widely expected that the central bank will be less aggressive and trim interest rates as early as fall, which unquestionably bodes well for the stock market. This is because, in a low-interest rate environment, consumer outlay increases, borrowing costs decrease and the economy strengthens.\n\nNonetheless, the unquenchable demand for AI models has mostly driven growth-oriented tech stocks higher and has been the major driving force behind the S&P 500\u2019s stupendous gains.\n\nTech Stocks Lead the Race\n\nThe Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) was one of the top gainers among the S&P 500 sectors, up an encouraging 17.5% year to date.\n\nTech stocks, in particular, advanced by leaps and bounds, banking on countless AI-driven technological developments. AI is expected to revolutionize business methods and create an affable business environment.\n\nSuper Micro, NVIDIA & Micron Stock Price Gains the Most\n\nAmong the tech stocks, Super Micro Computer, NVIDIA and Micron Technology have surged the most, up 188.2%, 149.5% and 54.1% so far this year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a major producer of dedicated AI servers, whose diversified business model is helping the stock grow. Its partnerships with NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD to access data center GPUs are helping Super Micro Computer to expand its business.\n\nSuper Micro Computer currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 9.4% over the past 60 days. SMCI\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is a whopping 101.7%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA has been a market darling for quite some time as the company continues to register eye-popping growth in recent quarters. NVIDIA enjoys an economic moat as it dominates the GPU market, while its data center business skyrocketed 427% to $22.6 billion in the last fiscal quarter.\n\nNVIDIA, at present, has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 12.1% over the past 60 days. NVDA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is a solid 106.2%.\n\nMaker of computer memory chips, Micron Technology also saw its shares scale upward due to an uptick in demand for its products for applications in new AI server chips. Substantial demand for Micron\u2019s high-bandwidth memory and high DRAM prices are lifting the company\u2019s share prices.\n\nPresently, Micron Technology has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 25.3% over the past 60 days. MU\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is a promising 124.5%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Top-Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks of 1H Set to Shine Further",
        "content": "The S&P 500 closed the first half of 2024 with a strong gain of 14%. Though the gain was below the level seen in the bumper first half of 2023, it represents one of the strongest performances for the first six months of a year since the late-1990s dot-com bubble. The broad market index achieved 31 records in the first six months with analysts expecting more records later in the year.\r\n\r\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) craze, rate-cut bets and strong corporate profit growth were the biggest catalysts driving the stocks higher. Investors can consider some of the best-performing stocks of the first half that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting continued outperformance. These stocks also have a double-digit expected earnings growth for the current fiscal year. Some such stocks are Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Vistra Energy Corp. VST, Constellation Energy Corporation CEG and Eli Lilly and Company LLY. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is the biggest engine of growth for the S&P 500, accounting for 31% of the weightage in the index. About 60% of the gains were driven by \u201cmega-cap\u201d tech companies \u2014 NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Apple. NVIDIA alone accounted for 31% of the market\u2019s first-half advance. With the latest surge, NVIDIA, Apple and Microsoft are in the race to become the world\u2019s most valuable company and hit a market capitalization of $4 trillion on surging enthusiasm over AI capabilities. This technology-driven momentum is expected to continue at least through the summer.\r\n\r\nIn the latest FOMC meeting, U.S. policymakers penciled in just one rate cut for this year and projected four cuts for 2025. The Fed altered language in its statement, noting there has been \u201cmodest further progress toward the committee\u2019s 2% inflation objective.\u201d Previously, the statement pointed to a \u201clack\u201d of further progress. Low rates reduce the cost of borrowing, often needed to finance the expansion of companies, thereby driving growth in the economy. It typically reduces the attractiveness of fixed-income investments like bonds, leading investors to seek higher returns in the equity markets.\r\n\r\nEarnings are expected to remain robust for the second quarter. Per Zacks Earnings Trends report, second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 index will be up 8.3% from the same period last year on 4.6% higher revenues. This is the highest quarterly earnings growth pace since 9.9% growth in the first quarter of 2022 and would follow 6.7% earnings growth on 3.2% revenue gains in the first quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nFurther, a strong first half for the S&P 500 Index historically bodes well for the rest of the year. Since the early 1950s, when the index climbs more than 10% through June, it rises by a median of roughly 10% in the second half, per data compiled by Bloomberg. However, elevated valuations, the U.S. presidential election in November and uncertainty about the path of interest-rate cuts will weigh on stocks in the second half of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst-Half Outperformers\n\nSuper Micro designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture. The stock skyrocketed 188.2% in the first half. Super Micro has an estimated earnings growth rate of 44.1% for the fiscal year (ending June 2025). It sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Momentum Score of B.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing units. The stock saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 3 cents for the fiscal year ending January 2025 over the past month and has an estimated growth rate of 106.1%. Shares of NVDA rose 149.5% in the first half. NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of A.\r\n\r\nVistra Energy is an energy company that offers electricity and power generation, distribution and transmission solutions. The stock surged 123.2% in the first half. It saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for this year over the past 30 days, with an estimated growth rate of 10%. Vistra Energy has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of B.\r\n\r\nConstellation Energy generates and markets electricity. It sells natural gas, renewable energy and other energy-related products and services. The stock jumped 71.3% in the first half. Constellation Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 52.7% for this year and a Zacks Rank #2.\r\n\r\nEli Lilly is one of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies and boasts a diversified product profile, including a solid lineup of new successful drugs. The stock gained 55.3% in the first half. Eli Lilly has an estimated earnings growth rate of 115.3% for this year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 1, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Super Micro Computer SMCI and Broadcom AVGO.\n\nThese A.I. Stocks Have Fallen: Time to Buy?\n\nLarge-cap technology stocks, particularly those associated with the AI trade, have faced considerable pressure over the last week or so, perhaps raising the eyebrows of many investors.\n\nMore specifically, beloved Nvidia, Super Micro Computer and Broadcom have all seen their shares dive, as we can see illustrated in the chart below that tracks performance from last Friday, June 21.\n\nThe price action raises a valid question \u2013 is this a temporary blip, reflecting an opportunity for those waiting on the sidelines? Let's take a closer look.\n\nNvidia's Data Center Continues to Break Records\n\nNvidia's Data Center sales have been a focal point amid the AI frenzy, which have shown unbelievable growth over the last year as companies race to scoop up chips. Concerning its latest period, Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion once again blew away our consensus estimate and reflected another quarterly record.\n\nThe company's unbelievable growth has also kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 43.0X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\n\nIt's worth noting here that NVDA shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully.\n\nDespite the adverse price action, the positive story surrounding the stock remains the same. Analysts' revisions remain positive across the board, keeping the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Positive earnings estimate revisions paired with a sound valuation picture will help the stock regain its footing, and the recent dip looks to be an opportunity.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Reclaims Key Level\n\nSuper Micro Computer shares have been notably hot in 2024, gaining nearly 200% and representing the top-performing S&P 500 stock. The company is a leading provider of application-optimized, high-performance server and storage solutions that address various computational-intensive workloads, explaining the robust demand being witnessed.\n\nThe company earnings picture remains bright, with revisions remaining steady over the last few weeks and reflecting notable bullishness from analysts overall. Growth is expected to remain robust, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 100% EPS growth on 110% higher sales.\n\nShares trade at a 24.3X forward 12-month earnings multiple, showing a premium relative to historical levels but still reflecting a considerable discount from highs of 54.7X in 2024. The steeper multiple reflects investors' expectations, with the current 0.4X PEG ratio also sitting at a sound level.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's worth noting that shares have reclaimed the 50-day moving average, a level that's previously caused shares to face resistance recently.\n\nBroadcom Posts Record AI Revenue\n\nBroadcom is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company's recent set of quarterly results brought post-earnings fireworks, with record revenue from AI products of $3.1 billion pleasing investors.\n\nFollowing the print, the company raised its current-year sales outlook, with free cash flow of $5.3 billion also jumping 18% year-over-year. AVGO has long been considered a cash-generating machine, allowing it to grow its dividend payouts consistently over the years.\n\nAnalysts took note of the favorable quarter, raising their earnings outlooks accordingly across the board. Shares trade at a 28.9X forward 12-month earnings multiple, steeply above the five-year median but nicely beneath 2024 highs of 42.0X.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile several large-cap technology stocks involved with the AI trade have faced pressure over the last week, all three companies above continue to sport bullish earnings outlooks, with revisions remaining stable.\n\nNothing has fundamentally changed behind the story, with market participants likely taking profits after their strong runs. All remain bullish, with earnings estimate revisions confirming the positive business trends being witnessed.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Insiders At Super Micro Computer Sold US$25m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "content": "Over the past year, many Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nView our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Super Micro Computer\n\nThe Founder, Charles Liang, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$13m worth of shares at a price of US$252 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$819, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 0.9% of Charles Liang's stake.\n\nAll up, insiders sold more shares in Super Micro Computer than they bought, over the last year. The average sell price was around US$315. It's not particularly great to see insiders were selling shares at below recent prices. But we wouldn't put too much weight on the insider selling. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nI will like Super Micro Computer better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this freelist of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nInsiders At Super Micro Computer Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Super Micro Computer. Specifically, Lead Independent Director Tally Liu ditched US$420k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nDoes Super Micro Computer Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Super Micro Computer insiders own about US$6.8b worth of shares (which is 14% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Super Micro Computer Tell Us?\n\nAn insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But it is good to see that Super Micro Computer is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example, Super Micro Computer has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about.\n\nBut note: Super Micro Computer may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Stock Is Up 190% So Far This Year. Can the Growth Continue in the Second Half of 2024?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has become one of the more dramatic and surprising companies in the stock market over the past year. The company existed for decades in obscurity, and its stock gained little traction for years after its 2007 initial public offering (IPO).\n\nHowever, a key partnership with Nvidia has changed the game for Supermicro (as the company is commonly called). Consequently, its stock is up 190% in the first half of this year. With its massive gains, investors are right to ask whether that momentum can continue through the second half of 2024.\n\nThe state of Supermicro\n\nSupermicro is a technology hardware company known for producing energy-saving, environmentally friendly tech products for the cloud, metaverse, and other applications. Its servers have gained the most attention, particularly those equipped with Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Thanks to this partnership, its profits and stock price have grown exponentially.\n\nAs recently as four years ago, its stock traded for about $24 per share. This year, its recent growth has been so dramatic that analysts predict nearly $24 per share for Supermicro's net income! Not surprisingly, such improvements have led to a 3,400% gain in the tech stock's price since 2020. SMCI Chart\n\nA Market.us study seems to confirm this trend. It predicts that the AI server industry will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30% through 2033, transforming what was a $31 billion industry last year into one worth $430 billion by 2033.\n\nCan the growth continue?\n\nEven the most dedicated Supermicro bulls should not expect another 3,400% gain over the next four-and-a-half years. While an additional 190% gain in six months is far from guaranteed, that move is not out of the question when one looks at the financials. In the nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), its net sales of $9.6 billion rose 95% from year-ago levels. Its cost of sales grew at a slightly faster 102%.\n\nConsequently, its net income of $855 million grew 92% over the same period. Also, with consensus estimates pointing to a 102% increase in net income for the fiscal year, its earnings are rising fast enough for the stock to maintain a rapid growth pace.\n\nAdditionally, despite surging profits and massive stock price growth, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 47 and its forward P/E ratio is 36. This is less than some of the faster-growing tech stalwarts such as Nvidia and Amazon, indicating it could sustain the multiple expansions needed to take the stock price much higher, possibly enough to maintain the current growth pace for another six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro in the second half of 2024\n\nGiven its business and financial conditions, a 190% gain for the second half of this year is a plausible scenario. Admittedly, the market makes no guarantees, and ultimately, investors should not expect a 190% move higher by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, demand for the company's servers is likely to continue rising, possibly enough to sustain near triple-digit revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nAt its current valuation, a 190% increase in the stock price would give it an expensive, but not record-breaking P/E ratio. Hence, even if it falls short of that ambitious goal, Supermicro could still deliver significant returns for the rest of the year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Down 30% From Its All-Time High, Should You Buy Artificial Intelligence (AI) Superstar Super Micro Computer?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) was one of the most prominent artificial intelligence (AI) investments of the year, rocketing over 300% higher from the start of the year to mid-March. Since then, the stock declined around 30% and has stayed fairly steady since the end of March.\n\nSo, should investors consider an AI stock that has been successful but has been sitting dormant for a while? After all, it was one of the best-performing stocks in the market to start the year.\n\nSupermicro is in a far more competitive space than Nvidia\n\nSuper Micro Computer (often called Supermicro) builds servers and data center components. This industry is clearly benefiting from the AI arms race, which is essentially the same trend driving Nvidia higher. As a result, investors saw this as a second chance to get in on Nvidia after they missed the move in 2023 (even though Nvidia is up over 150% in 2024 so far).\n\nIf you had that idea on New Year's Day and put it into action the following trading day, you'd still be beating Nvidia. But with Nvidia's steady rise, that may not last for long. SMCI Chart\n\nBut why has Supermicro been so stagnant for so long? A lot of it has to deal with high expectations. After Nvidia posted multiple consecutive quarters of revenue tripling, investors expected Supermicro to post similar figures, as it is affected by the same trend.\n\nHowever, that was a flawed analysis, as the industry that Supermicro competes in is far more competitive. With competition from heavy hitters like Dell and Hewlett Packard, Supermicro has its work cut out for it. The primary differentiating factor for Supermicro is how customizable it makes its servers, as they can be tailored for any workload or size.\n\nThis still makes Supermicro a top pick in the space, but it doesn't make it the cheapest.\n\nAnother factor for Supermicro comparatively slower growth is that the largest customers may be building some of their servers in-house. While they still source some components from Supermicro, it's not the same as if they were buying everything from the company.\n\nWith all of these factors adding up to not meeting the incredibly high expectations, reality set in, and investors sold off the stock from its highs. But have they gone too far?\n\nThe stock is still valued highly\n\nIn its earnings report for the fiscal third quarter of 2024, ending March 31, management reiterated its long-term goal of generating $25 billion in annual revenue. Considering its guidance for fiscal year 2024 revenue of $14.7 to $15.1 billion, Supermicro still has a ways to go.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut what if it did achieve that goal?\n\nIf Supermicro could generate $25 billion in annual revenue at its current profit margin (10.5%), then it would produce a hypothetical $2.63 billion in annual earnings.\n\nNow, if we divide its current market cap by that earnings figure, we would get its price-to-earnings (P/E) valuation. That calculation yields a P/E of 18.8, which isn't a bad price for a stock. At the height of Supermicro's price in mid-March, that calculation yielded a P/E of 25.6, which is far higher.\n\nSo, is this a price worth paying? I'd say no. For this projection to hold water, everything must go right and be sustained. Any deviation to the downside renders this analysis void and would make it a bad investment. With so little margin for error, I will pass on Supermicro stock, even though the company may continue to succeed.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Many investors flocked toward artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past years to capitalize on the growth of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT. That bullish stampede drove many tech stocks higher -- even as inflation, high interest rates, and other macro headwinds battered other less-resilient sectors.\n\nBut as the first half of 2024 ends, some investors might be wondering if the historic AI rally will run out of steam. I think investors should be a bit more selective with their AI stocks, but three of the most obvious plays -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- are still worth buying. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is the largest producer of discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) in the world. It once generated most of its revenue from the PC gaming market, but its data center GPU sales skyrocketed over the past two years to become its largest business segment.\n\nThe growth was entirely driven by the rapid expansion of the AI market since Nvidia's high-end GPUs are widely used to accelerate machine learning and AI tasks. All of the world's top generative AI companies -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google -- currently use its GPUs.\n\nNvidia now controls 88% of the discrete GPU market, according to JPR, and the market's demand for its chips continues to outstrip its supply. As a result, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 98% and 109%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 (which ends next January). Its stock still looks reasonably valued at less than 50 times forward earnings and could head even higher as the AI market expands.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer, also known as Supermicro, carved out its own niche by producing high-performance, liquid-cooled servers for demanding tasks. That's why it wasn't too surprising when Nvidia partnered with the company a few years ago and granted it access to its high-end data center GPUs before many of its larger competitors.\n\nNvidia's support enabled Supermicro to claim a 10% share of the dedicated AI server market. Bank of America expects it to grow its slice to 17% over the next three years as the broader market expands 150%.\n\nSupermicro already generates about half of its revenue from AI servers, but that percentage should keep rising as it gains ground against bigger server makers and diversifies its business with new AI servers powered by Advanced Micro Devices' cheaper chips.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect Supermicro's revenue and earnings to grow 110% and 102%, respectively. Those are incredible growth rates for a stock that trades at just 23 times forward earnings, so it could still have plenty of room to run.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft became a growth stock again over the past decade as it expanded its cloud-based services and Azure -- which became the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS). It also became the largest investor in OpenAI and subsequently integrated the start-up's generative AI tools into Azure, its Bing search engine, and its other cloud-based services.\n\nThe expansion of that AI ecosystem boosted Azure's growth and widened its moat against Google in the search and advertising markets. It also acquired Activision Blizzard last year to strengthen its Xbox gaming business and lock more gamers into its subscription-based Game Pass and Cloud Gaming ecosystems.\n\nMicrosoft's broader diversification makes it a balanced way to profit from the growth of the cloud, AI, and gaming markets. Analysts expect the company's revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 14% and 13%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 (which ends next June). Its stock might not seem cheap at 34 times forward earnings, but its strengths should justify its higher valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "1 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Soars 70%, According to Loop Capital",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is in full swing, and according to one Wall Street analyst, things don't appear to be slowing down any time soon for one extremely well-positioned company.\n\nWhile most investors are gravitating toward chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) at the moment, AI is and will continue to mint other market winners as well.\u00a0In fact, one S&P 500 AI company has outperformed even Nvidia this year. And despite this stock's impressive 2024 run, one Wall Street analyst predicts another 70% surge.\n\nSuper Micro Computer has beaten Nvidia and is ready for a liquid cooling breakout\n\nThis year, server-maker Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has already surged 212%, handily outperforming Nvidia's impressive 149% year-to-date gain.\n\nSupermicro has undoubtedly benefited handily from a close partnership with Nvidia as a preferred server partner. However, the company has also been gaining market share thanks to its in-house engineering prowess.\n\nSupermicro's strategy of building servers out of \"building block\" pieces allows for fast, large-scale customization while also saving customers money. With the building block architecture, parts of a server are easily swapped and upgraded rather than having to replace the whole unit.\n\nMoreover, the building block architecture and close relationship with Silicon Valley tech companies generally allow Supermicro to custom-build servers faster than rivals. With so many companies falling over themselves to build advanced AI infrastructure as quickly as possible, it's no wonder customers are flocking to Supermicro's solutions. SMCI Chart\n\nIn addition, Supermicro's longtime ethos of resource-saving, energy-efficient design has come to the fore in the age of AI. AI chips require a tremendous amount of energy and must dissipate lots of heat. To help further lower energy costs, Supermicro is now rolling out its own direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology.\n\nDLC technology has been around for decades. However, because it's an added cost and can take a long time to deploy in a data center, it has garnered only around 1% of the data center market.\n\nHowever, AI servers are becoming extremely energy-intensive and will soon require DLC as opposed to air-cooled racks. DLC data centers limit the need for extensive air conditioning systems, saving both energy and space within the data center and thereby allowing even denser server clusters.\n\nFrom its mere 1% market share, CEO Charles Liang expects a wave of DLC deployments to make up 15% of Supermicro racks this year and 30% next year. According to Liang, Supermicro can deliver DLC solutions within weeks today, and DLC deployment can help reduce data center power usage by up to 40%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, despite the company's 200% revenue growth last quarter, DLC's benefits to customers should help keep up the company's hypergrowth and margins for the foreseeable future. Is Super Micro Computer going to $1,500 per share? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLoop Capital thinks Supermicro is going to $1,500\n\nOver the past few years, Supermicro has routinely trounced even the most bullish analyst expectations. But with this year's admission to the S&P 500 Index, many more Wall Street analysts have begun covering the stock.\n\nOne of the most bullish is the technology-centered research shop Loop Capital. In April, Loop analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on Super Micro Computer from $600 to $1,500 per share.\n\nExplaining the increase, Baruah correctly noted that Supermicro has developed a reputation as \"an increasing leader in the need for both complexity and scale\" for AI deployments. Furthermore, Baruah sees Supermicro's speed and agility as a key factor, elaborating, \"While it's not truly possible to know the magnitude of these wins or timeframe of deployments, there has been a general industry dynamic of standing up deployments faster as opposed to slower.\"\n\nTo obtain his valuation, Baruah sees Supermicro earning between $50 and $60 in fiscal 2026, ending in June of 2026, on revenue of between $30 billion and $40 billion. That compares with estimates for nearly $15 billion in revenue and $24 billion in fiscal 2024, which ends today, June 30.\n\nWith that type of growth and earnings power, Baruah thinks Supermicro can retain a 25 to 30 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, even in 2026. So, 30 times $50 or 25 times $60 gets one to his $1,500 target.\n\nSupermicro could be more advantaged than Nvidia\n\nWhile Nvidia is the king of AI chips today, the company is also due to receive an onslaught of competition from other processor companies and cloud giants' custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). However, Supermicro's servers can house any kind of AI chip.\n\nThus, Supermicro should see continued growth and share gains no matter which AI chip wins the day or even if the wins are spread out among several chipmakers. That makes the stock a solid buy today, even after its impressive year-to-date gains.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Is Up 149% This Year. Here Are 2 Stocks That Could Outperform It the Rest of 2024.",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to own in the artificial intelligence (AI) race so far. The company's revenue has tripled year over year in recent quarters, sending the stock up 149% in the first half of 2024.\n\nAt these lofty share prices, Nvidia's valuation looks stretched. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio was less than 30 to start the year, but it now trades at a more expensive 45 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. Nvidia might experience enough growth to push the stock higher, but there's also a chance that near-term demand is already baked into the share price, which could limit the stock's gains through the end of the year.\n\nThe good news is that Nvidia isn't the only AI stock beating the market. Nvidia has benefited from tight supply of AI chips, but as supply improves, it could drive more demand for AI servers, and the stocks of these companies trade at more reasonable valuations, which could set up superior returns in the near term.\n\nHere are two AI server stocks that could outperform Nvidia for the rest of the year.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has outperformed Nvidia in 2024, up 188%. It sells rack-mount systems for data centers. Because of its exposure to the broader demand for AI chips, Supermicro (as it is also known) is a solid alternative to Nvidia.\n\nSupermicro sells into several markets, including 5G connectivity and edge computing. But demand for its plug-and-play rack systems that feature data center chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are key drivers of its growth right now. Revenue surged 200% year over year last quarter, which mirrors Nvidia's growth.\n\nSelling server systems is a competitive market, but it's encouraging to see Supermicro growing faster than the industry. It maintains close relationships with suppliers like Nvidia, which helps the company deliver innovative solutions before competitors. It's currently pushing the adoption of direct liquid cooling solutions, which it has developed for years, to better manage the heat generated from AI computing systems.\n\nIf it continues to outpace the rest of the server industry, the stock could have substantial upside. Wall Street analysts expect Supermicro's earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 46% over the next several years -- higher than the 33% estimate for Nvidia.\n\nMoreover, Supermicro stock also offers better value than Nvidia. Its current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 35 -- lower than the 45 forward P/E multiple for Nvidia. Investors are getting more earnings growth for a lower price with Supermicro -- a recipe for superior returns.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Dell Technologies\n\nDell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) shares are up 80% year to date, but the company's shares could outperform Nvidia for the rest of the year due to accelerating demand for the company's AI servers.\n\nDell generates most of its revenue from client solutions, which include sales of PCs, but infrastructure solutions is its fastest-growing business, with revenue up 22% year over year last quarter. AI server shipments more than doubled over the year-ago period. Over the last year, revenue from AI servers exploded from zero to $1.7 billion, and it's just getting started.\n\nSales of AI servers are weighing on Dell's gross margin, but the robust revenue growth expected in the AI server business could support substantial earnings growth to send the stock higher over the next few years.\n\nThe company's AI server backlog grew approximately 31% in the last quarter to $3.8 billion. That increase might reflect new business from Tesla, according to Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani. Dell seems to be in a strong competitive position, as the analyst believes that Dell won a larger amount of server business with the electric vehicle maker than Supermicro.\n\nWall Street analysts project earnings to grow 12% annually over the next several years, and those estimates might increase further once Dell's PC business recovers. The stock's forward P/E of 18 looks attractive against the potential for accelerating earnings growth and could provide superior returns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Elon Musk Just Gave Super Micro Computer and Dell Investors a Reason to Cheer",
        "content": "One of the biggest themes in the markets for the last two years has been artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNaturally, famed entrepreneur Elon Musk has found himself at the center of the AI revolution -- and he just gave investors a big reason to seriously consider both Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nLet's explore how Musk is working with these AI leaders, and assess if these stocks are good buys right now.\n\nWhat did Elon Musk just say?\n\nIn addition to running Tesla and social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk is also managing an AI start-up, called xAI.\n\nxAI is building a chatbot called Grok, and is aiming to compete with the likes of OpenAI. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI but abandoned the project back in 2018. Since his departure, Musk has gotten into many publicized tiffs with OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, over safety concerns and how AI should be used in society.\n\nIn early June, Musk revealed that xAI will be utilizing a series of AI chips from Nvidia. The entrepreneur followed up this announcement with another exciting development.\n\nSMC\n\n-- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 19, 2024\n\nNamely, Musk took to X to tell investors and AI enthusiasts that xAI will be partnering with Dell and Supermicro to build its AI infrastructure such as server rack solutions and factory architecture.\n\nHow Dell and Supermicro stand to benefit\n\nAI has many different components. One of the biggest bellwethers for AI at the moment are specialized chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are used to train large language models and other computing functions to develop generative AI applications.\n\nRight now, Nvidia is the undisputed leader of AI chips -- owning an estimated 80% share of the market.\n\nHowever, deploying chips into machine learning models and other use cases is only part of the broader equation. Companies such as Dell and Supermicro specialize in a different area within the chip realm.\n\nBoth Dell and Supermicro are major players in AI infrastructure solutions. Essentially, both companies specialize in designing integrated systems architecture, server racks, and storage clusters for data centers.\n\nConsidering xAI just raised $6 billion in funding back in May, Dell and Supermicro appear well positioned to benefit from AI tailwinds as xAI moves swiftly to catch up with the competition. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDell, Supermicro, both, or neither?\n\nOn the surface, owning different businesses across the semiconductor landscape might be a good idea. AI is still in its infancy, and there are many different applications among chip companies that are playing a role in the technology's development.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith that said, a close look at valuation should shed some light on investing in Dell and Supermicro in particular. DELL PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple for Dell and Supermicro over the last few years. While neither stock looks cheap, Dell is clearly trading at a noticeable discount to Supermicro. With that said, Supermicro's premium is arguably warranted considering how fast the company is growing.\n\nMoreover, one of my biggest knocks against Supermicro has been that the company relies heavily on business from Nvidia -- a dynamic that could hurt the company in the long run as more companies design competing chips.\n\nNow, with a nod of approval from Musk and xAI, I'm more optimistic about Supermicro's prospects of branching out and earning meaningful business from new customers in the AI space.\n\nAt the end of the day, allocating a portion of your AI holdings to both Dell and Supermicro could be a good idea for long-term investors. If I had to just choose one company, I think Dell is the better value compared to Supermicro based on its lower P/E and diversified business. Considering Supermicro is still relatively small, I think its valuation needs to continue normalizing before it looks like a bargain opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "These AI Stocks Have Fallen: Time to Buy NVDA, SMCI, AVGO?",
        "content": "Large-cap technology stocks, particularly those associated with the AI trade, have faced considerable pressure over the last week or so, perhaps raising the eyebrows of many investors.\n\nMore specifically, beloved Nvidia NVDA, Super Micro Computer SMCI, and Broadcom AVGO have all seen their shares dive, as we can see illustrated in the chart below that tracks performance from last Friday, June 21. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe price action raises a valid question \u2013 is this a temporary blip, reflecting an opportunity for those waiting on the sidelines? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center Continues to Break Records\n\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center sales have been a focal point amid the AI frenzy, which have shown unbelievable growth over the last year as companies race to scoop up chips. Concerning its latest period, Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion once again blew away our consensus estimate and reflected another quarterly record.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company\u2019s unbelievable growth has also kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 43.0X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that NVDA shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite the adverse price action, the positive story surrounding the stock remains the same. Analysts\u2019 revisions remain positive across the board, keeping the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Positive earnings estimate revisions paired with a sound valuation picture will help the stock regain its footing, and the recent dip looks to be an opportunity. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSuper Micro Computer Reclaims Key Level\n\nSuper Micro Computer shares have been notably hot in 2024, gaining nearly 200% and representing the top-performing S&P 500 stock. The company is a leading provider of application-optimized, high-performance server and storage solutions that address various computational-intensive workloads, explaining the robust demand being witnessed.\n\nThe company earnings picture remains bright, with revisions remaining steady over the last few weeks and reflecting notable bullishness from analysts overall. Growth is expected to remain robust, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 100% EPS growth on 110% higher sales.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares trade at a 24.3X forward 12-month earnings multiple, showing a premium relative to historical levels but still reflecting a considerable discount from highs of 54.7X in 2024. The steeper multiple reflects investors' expectations, with the current 0.4X PEG ratio also sitting at a sound level. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that shares have reclaimed the 50-day moving average, a level that\u2019s previously caused shares to face resistance recently. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBroadcom Posts Record AI Revenue\n\nBroadcom is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company\u2019s recent set of quarterly results brought post-earnings fireworks, with record revenue from AI products of $3.1 billion pleasing investors.\n\nFollowing the print, the company raised its current-year sales outlook, with free cash flow of $5.3 billion also jumping 18% year-over-year. AVGO has long been considered a cash-generating machine, allowing it to grow its dividend payouts consistently over the years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts took note of the favorable quarter, raising their earnings outlooks accordingly across the board. Shares trade at a 28.9X forward 12-month earnings multiple, steeply above the five-year median but nicely beneath 2024 highs of 42.0X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile several large-cap technology stocks involved with the AI trade have faced pressure over the last week, all three companies above \u2013 Nvidia NVDA, Super Micro Computer SMCI, and Broadcom AVGO \u2013 continue to sport bullish earnings outlooks, with revisions remaining stable.\n\nNothing has fundamentally changed behind the story, with market participants likely taking profits after their strong runs. All remain bullish, with earnings estimate revisions confirming the positive business trends being witnessed.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Reasons Why SMCI Stock Could Still Be a Buy",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock is having a moment. Over half the company\u2019s revenue comes from AI GPU platforms. Super Micro is a leading provider of AI technology, offering Direct Liquid Cooling systems that reduce cooling costs by up to 40% compared to air-cooled systems.\n\nSuper Micro recently expanded production in Malaysia, Taiwan, and Silicon Valley to meet demand, using next-gen Intel XEON and AMD Turin platforms. SMCI stock offers exposure to AI\u2019s hypergrowth trends for long-term growth investors.\n\nxAI Collaboration Benefits Super Micro\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and Super Micro Computer stocks surged on June 20 after Elon Musk announced they would supply servers for his AI startup xAI\u2019s supercomputer project.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFollowing Musk\u2019s announcement, Dell Technologies saw its shares rise by more than 5%, while Super Micro Computer experienced a notable increase of over 8% in recent trading sessions. This surge reflects investor optimism in the potential success of Musk\u2019s supercomputer initiative.\n\nNamed \u201cDojo,\u201d the $500 million project will be built in Buffalo, New York, with plans for another advanced supercomputer cluster at Tesla\u2019s Austin, Texas facility. These technologies aim to bolster Tesla\u2019s capabilities in computer vision and large language models, crucial for advancing robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\nEstablished in 2023, xAI sought to challenge AI leaders like Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Alphabet\u2019s Google. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, now directs his expertise and resources toward advancing xAI in the AI sector. Partnering with Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer ensures xAI\u2019s access to crucial hardware for its AI advancements.\n\nSMCI Has Great Growth Potential\n\nIn Q4 2023, Supermicro\u2019s revenue increased 37% and earnings rose 115%. AI server sales primarily drove this growth. The market predicts a 110% increase in revenue in 2024. Although the company faces challenges in gaming GPU sales and data center chip demand, with Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) influence, SMCI could still thrive.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia saw a 126% increase in data center GPU sales amid the growing generative AI market. Analysts are expecting a 98% increase for 2025, and I think SMCI stock is likely to continue to benefit from this optimistic outlook. The company is expected to see more growth, with revenue rising 58% until 2026.\n\nThat said, the company is capable of targeting a bigger share in the AI server market. If the company is able to grow its market share in this key high-growth market, while also growing margins over time from an improving mix, that\u2019s a strong bullish thesis to get behind.\n\nStory continues\n\nGreat Nvidia Influence\n\nSuper Micro Computer relies heavily on integrating Nvidia GPUs into its data center products. It functions as a key Nvidia partner, providing essential hardware and software for customer applications.\n\nRecently, SMCI unveiled its SuperCluster lineup capable of supporting 256 to 512 Nvidia H100 or H200 GPUs, tailored to various cooling needs and client specifications. These configurations, like a liquid-cooled setup with 512 H200 GPUs costing up to $40,000 each, could lead to significant expenses exceeding $20 million solely in GPU costs.\n\nDepending on demand, SMCI could become one of Nvidia\u2019s top clients in the coming decade. While SMCI may outperform Nvidia in the short term, both stocks remain attractive for long-term investors because of their distinct market focuses in AI.\n\nIts partnership with Nvidia for high-end GPUs is crucial, but it\u2019s also integrating AMD\u2019s GPUs to diversify and sustain sales growth independently of Nvidia\u2019s dominance.\n\nWhile Nvidia remains dominant in GPUs with 88% market share, Super Micro aims to leverage its partnerships for substantial market expansion.\n\nSMCI Stock Is a Buy In My Books\n\nSuper Micro has clearly appealed to investors holding Nvidia and other AI-adjacent stocks because of its strong position in the AI-friendly server market. With revenue and earnings projected to double in 2024 and potentially in future years, this is a stock that could certainly look cheap in a year or two down the road.\n\nI think there\u2019s a reason growth investors are piling into this name. Right now, alongside Nvidia, SMCI stock looks to be among the most sure bets investors with a short-term time horizon may want to consider for outperformance in this space.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Should Have Replaced Sirius XM Holdings in the Nasdaq 100 (Rather Than ARM)",
        "content": "When I\u00a0 first thought of the idea for this article, Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) was still a part of the Nasdaq 100, a collection of 100 of the largest non-financial stocks listed on Nasdaq. However, there was speculation certain companies were Nasdaq 100 stock candidates to replace the satellite radio business.\n\nSure enough, on June 13, Nasdaq announced that SIRI was out and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) was in. Sirius XM was ousted from the index because its market capitalization had fallen below 0.1% of the total market cap of the 100 companies.\n\nWith the addition-subraction move, the index\u2019s total market cap jumped by approximately $150 billion. It now sits at $26.03 trillion. This suggests that several other companies could be dropped from the index in the weeks and months ahead. Possible deletions include Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which is the smallest weighting in the index at 0.09%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith up to four stocks on the chopping block, here are my three Nasdaq 100 stock candidates.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is the largest of my three recommendations by market cap at $49.24 billion. Not only would it be a good stock candidate for the Nasdaq 100, it also could use a stock split with its shares up 194% in 2024, and trading above $840.\n\nAs Barron\u2019s pointed out in its coverage of the NASDAQ 100 in mid-June, Super Micro\u2019s huge gains in 2024 was a big reason for it being added to the S&P 500, so it\u2019s very possible the server maker could be next after ARM.\n\nWorking against Super Micro is the fact there are already 39 technology companies in the NASDAQ 100. If added, it would have a larger market cap than just 12 of them.\n\nWorking in its favor is the fact it\u2019s fairly popular with analysts. Of the 19 that cover its stock, 14 rate it a Buy, with a target price of $1,029.76, 23% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nAlso working in its favor: There are no computer hardware companies in the index. Of the five large-cap (over $10 billion) technology stocks trading on Nasdaq in the computer hardware industry, SMCI has the largest market cap.\n\nTractor Supply (TSCO) The exterior of a Tractor Supply (TSCO) store\n\nSource: James R. Martin/Shutterstock.com\n\nTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is a specialty retailer in Tennessee. I\u2019ve liked its business for a long time. As far back as September 2014, I discussed with InvestorPlace readers why the retailer, whose primary customer was, and still is, the gentleman farmer, was a great stock to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the time, it operated 1,300 stores in 48 states. Today, it operates 2,233 Tractor Supply stores in 49 states, plus 202 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in 23 states. In 2014, it had revenue of $5.71 billion, and $589.5 million operating income. In 2023, revenues and operating income were $14.56 billion and $1.48 billion, respectively, which works out to compound annual growth of 10.96% and\u00a0 10.77%.\n\nAs a result, its shares have a compound annual growth rate of 13.8% over the past 9.5 years. Including dividends, it has a 10-year annualized total return of 16.4%.\n\nNot too shabby.\n\nAnalysts are mixed about TSCO stock. Of the 33 that cover Tractor Supply, 16 rate at a buy, less than half the analyst coverage. Further, the target price of $278 is just 4% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not cheap right now with a price-to-sales ratio of 1.97x, its highest level since 2021. However, over the long term it\u2019s proven to be a winner.\n\nFerrovial (FER) A series of roads and overpasses connect in an aerial view.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe smallest of three NASDAQ stocks by market cap is Ferrovial (NASDAQ:FER), the European-based infrastructure operator. The company operates toll roads, airports, and builds infrastructure worldwide.\n\nFounded in 1952, the company began work on railway projects in Spain. In 1958, Renfe, the Spanish railway company, awarded Ferrovial the contract to build an 18-mile railway link between Las Rosas and\u00a0 Chamart\u00edn, in Madrid.\n\nAn example of its work is the 407 ETR toll highway in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada. It built the 67-mile toll road and owns 43.23% of the 407 ETR Concession Company Limited, which operates it.\n\nIn June 2022, the company\u2019s Airports business acquired the rights to design, build, and operate the new Terminal One at New York\u2019s JFK airport. It has a lease through 2060.\n\nOf the 10 companies in the index from the Industrials sector, none represents the infrastructure industry. There are 23 Industrials companies trading on Nasdaq with a market cap over $10 billion. It has the 11th largest at $27.34 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks Ready to Get a Boost From Elon Musk\u2019s Grok",
        "content": "The AI wars are heating up, and Elon Musk has joined the race. Grok, X\u2019s chatbot, is his answer to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. While Musk has long touted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of the top AI stocks due to its self-driving technology, his attention has turned to Grok.\n\nIn May, xAI announced a series B round raising $6 billion from Saudi Arabian Prince Al Waleed bin Talal, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and others. These funds allow xAI to fast-track its upgrade of Grok to keep up with ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude.\n\nA portion of these funds will go toward employees. With Big Tech companies and startups scrambling for competent engineers, AI talent wars have escalated. It\u2019s now common for compensation for a top AI engineer to exceed $1 million annually.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe remaining funds will go toward infrastructure, such as AI servers, storage and networking. These AI stocks are key suppliers to the xAI Grok project. They will benefit from the increase in capital expenditure by xAI.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the leading provider of AI chips, anyone developing large language models and AI chatbots must build on Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) infrastructure. Musk has relied on the semiconductor\u2019s giant chips for Tesla\u2019s AI projects. Once again, he will resort to Nvidia\u2019s hardware to power Grok.\n\nAccording to the Information, xAI acquired over 20,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs in 2023 to train its Grok 2 model. However, the chatbot still lags behind the latest GPT 4o or Claude 3.5 performance. Therefore, Elon Musk must invest more in hardware and training to make xAI one of the top AI companies.\n\nMusk estimates that a future iteration, Grok 3, would need more resources, upwards of over 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs to train the model. Truly, these are very expensive chips, costing about $30,000 each. Therefore, orders from xAI will be a huge boost for Nvidia\u2019s revenues.\n\nGoing forward, Nvidia will remain one of the top AI stocks. Its advantage in AI chips at the moment is almost unassailable. It announced the next generation AI chip architecture Blackwell in March at the GTC conference, with deliveries later this year. Ultimately, companies that want to dominate in the AI era want the best hardware \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother immediate beneficiary of Grok\u2019s spending is Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL). The company is well-positioned in the AI server market to meet the needs of cloud service providers and startups like xAI. The latest disclosure that it will assist in powering Grok makes it one of the top AI stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDue to its engineering advantage and technical differentiation, DELL has emerged as a leader in the AI server market. Customers like Grok favor its customizable solutions that deliver end-to-end solutions. Dell Technologies offers a wholesome AI server solution that includes design, integration, deployment, optimization and support services.\n\nOn June 20, Elon Musk disclosed that DELL was one of the suppliers that will assemble its AI servers. In a post on X, the billionaire disclosed that Dell Technologies was making half of the racks that will go into xAI\u2019s supercomputer. In a follow-up, Michael Dell teased the AI factories they were building in partnership with Nvidia.\n\nLastly, besides Grok, Dell Technologies has hundreds of AI server clients. These customers have outstanding orders that guarantee demand into 2025, making Dell Technologies one of the top AI stocks for 2025. Morgan Stanley thinks DELL\u2019s AI server momentum will accelerate, driving a $200 price target in the bullish case.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been one of the top AI stocks. Although the stock has retreated from its highs above $ 1,200, it is still up by 196% YTD as of this writing. And the gains are far from over since it will enjoy a boost from Grok.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, xAI is building an AI factory to power the latest Grok model. Super Micro Computer is one of the AI stocks that are well-positioned to profit. Particularly, it has a competitive advantage in AI servers with liquid cooling at scale and can ship over 2,000 AI server racks a month.\n\nSo, it came as no surprise when CNBC reported that Super Micro Computer would also supply xAI. It can customize AI server racks to application-specific platforms in accordance with customer needs. Furthermore, its fully functional plug-and-play systems are what xAI needs to scale Grok\u2019s training quickly.\n\nConsidering this revenue boost, Super Micro Computer isn\u2019t done with its rally and has more upside. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) expects the company to profit from strong demand from tier-2 cloud service providers and sovereigns. Their $1,090 price target presents over 25% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 AI Data Center Stocks With Room to Roar",
        "content": "Over the past year, some of the top AI data center stocks have been about as hot as the GPU makers themselves. Booming demand for AI computing brings forth greater demand for AI chips, which, in turn, means more AI-ready data centers are going to need to be constructed.\n\nIndeed, many investors have recognized that data center stocks are a more \u201cdownstream\u201d way to play the AI boom.\n\nThat\u2019s why data center companies like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) have been able to come from seemingly out of nowhere in just the past year and a half. The growth to be had in the data center plays has been scorching, and it\u2019s really tough to tell when the tides will reverse until the GPU makers themselves exhibit some form of weakness.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this piece, we\u2019ll check out three data center stocks that have been exhibiting volatility but may be far from rolling over.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, we have the great Super Micro Computer, which began looking \u201ctoppy\u201d after the rocky sell-off it suffered back in March and April. After doubling up many times over in the past two years (shares up over 1,800% in that span), such a double-digit percentage plunge is surely startling for latecomers to SMCI stock.\n\nIn the grander scheme of things, though, this pullback may be more of an opportunity than a \u201crun off the cliff\u201d moment, especially as some investors sell over the fear of sheer volatility and the potential bear-case scenario downside if AI demand were suddenly to run into a wall.\n\nUnless you believe the AI boom is well past mid-cycle, perhaps the stock chart itself is the primary source of anxiety because the valuation does not look all too outlandish at these levels. With the potential for AI demand to stay strong in the second half, SMCI stock may still have what it takes to recover from a multi-month period of painful price action.\n\nLooking ahead, expect Super Micro to double down on what differentiates itself from the pack. Whether it\u2019s the liquid cooling tech to take the heat off blistering-hot GPUs or the Super Micro\u2019s \u201cbuilding block\u201d architecture of designing servers, the data center firm seems to have a moat that\u2019s quite wide.\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nVertiv (NYSE:VRT) is another digital infrastructure play that\u2019s been on a blistering run, just like Super Micro.\n\nYear to date, VRT stock hasn\u2019t been nearly as hot as SMCI, up just over 100% versus SMCI stock\u2019s nearly 200% gain. Despite trailing Super Micro in performance, Vertiv still looks considerably more expensive at 38.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) versus 22.9 times for Super Micro.\n\nStory continues\n\nVertiv stands to benefit from the same AI tailwinds as Super Micro Computer, but with a more diversified business that spans well beyond the data center, Vertiv may be better able to hold its own in the face of a mid-cycle AI chip demand cool-off, which will happen at some point.\n\nAdditionally, thermal management stands out as a competitive differentiator, according to analysts over at Oppenheimer. If you seek diversification and AI data center upside, perhaps the premium on VRT stock is worth paying.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) is a sizeable tech juggernaut that has been \u201cflooring it\u201d when it comes to data center expansion. The company is reportedly constructing 100 new data centers worldwide while expanding upon 66 existing ones. As a large $383 billion company with deep pockets, Oracle has the financial firepower to make a really deep dive into this AI boom.\n\nMore intriguingly, the company also has what it takes to power all of its data centers with 100% renewable sources of energy by 2025. That\u2019s a seriously impressive renewable energy promise and one that could help separate it from the pack. Indeed, if there\u2019s a firm that could hit the ambitious target, it\u2019s Oracle.\n\nCombined with Oracle\u2019s cloud and AI tech talent and Oracle may be the top blue-chip way to play the data center boom for the long term. At 22.2 times forward P/E, ORCL stock certainly looks like one of the cheapest of the pack.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "There\u2019s no bad time to buy A-rated stocks. But if you want to be richer than you are now, one of the best things you can do for yourself this June is to invest in A-rated stocks and watch the returns come in.\n\nWhen I\u2019m talking about A-rated stocks, of course, I\u2019m referring to the rankings assigned to all stocks by the Portfolio Grader. Stocks get \u201cA\u201d ratings based on their earnings performance, growth history, analyst sentiment and momentum.\n\nYou have a much better chance to make money with A-rated stocks than with those that have a poor rating, so I always use the Portfolio Grader as a tool when I\u2019m looking at new stocks, or when its time to rebalance my portfolios.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJune is the perfect time for this exercise. We are approaching the end of the second quarter, which is an ideal time to check on your portfolio to see how it\u2019s performing compared to the general market.\n\nJune is also a time where many companies announce quarterly earnings and issue or reaffirm guidance for the rest of the year. That\u2019s important information for any investor, especially for those of us looking at A-rated stocks.\n\nThe stock market continues to be strong this year, carried primarily by tech stocks.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to lose out on the opportunities that the markets offer this June, so I encourage you to review your holdings versus the Portfolio Grader and look to optimize your holdings. If you\u2019re looking to make a change, these seven stocks are ideal selections.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times over the course of the last year I led off a series of recommendations with the semiconductor maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). But if you\u2019re a skittish investor, you may be nervous about the recent dip this company saw.\n\nDon\u2019t be.\n\nFollowing another great earnings report and the company\u2019s successful 10-for-1 stock split, Nvidia extended its mammoth run to a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion and was briefly the No. 1 company in the world in terms of market capitalization.\n\nBut then we saw a dip \u2014 roughly 13% over three trading sessions, and some people started saying that the NVDA bubble was finally popping.\n\nThey were wrong \u2014 NVDA is already climbing its way back up. And Nvidia hardly represents a bubble. This is a company that makes that powerful semiconductors that handle the most complex computer operations, including machine learning, generative artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.\n\nNvidia has a massive market share in making these chips, with even better products in the workflow to be released over the next few quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s why analysts from Bank of America and Jefferies are still touting NVDA stock, and why you\u2019re going to see Nvidia continue to gain new highs in 2024.\n\nNVDA stock is up 154% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome company has to make the server infrastructure that allows companies who are buying up NVDA chips to package them together and so they can run generative AI.\n\nThat\u2019s where Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), or Supermicro, comes in.\n\nSMCI took a hit recently as its stock price fell from nearly $1,200 to less than $800. But the stock is already rebounding, helped in no small part by Nvidia\u2019s strength and the bullish sentiment that surrounds it.\n\nThe company is also making some key moves, such as collaborating on building a large AI data center in Japan, and it\u2019s work into building \u201cDirect Liquid Cooling\u201d servers that would offer energy cost and environmental advantages over those that utilize traditional fan-based cooling systems.\n\nIf you\u2019re kicking yourself for not buying SMCI when it was under $800, don\u2019t fret. This company has a long path ahead of it and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it go back over $1,000 and re-challenge its previous highs.\n\nSMCI stock is up 196% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nI love a good stock split, because they instantly increase the liquidity of a stock by making shares more affordable.\n\nThe share price decreases as the total number of shares increase, so while an individual investor still has the same position in the company, the number of shares they have increase.\n\nFor example, when Nvidia had a share price of $1,200 and did its 10-for-1 split, an investor with a single share of NVDA stock suddenly had 10 shares valued at $120 each.\n\nThat brings us to Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), which more than topped Nvidia\u2019s trick. Chipotle just completed an amazing 50-for-1 split, bringing the share price from $3,283 to roughly $65.\n\nBut if you had a single CMG share, you now have 50 of those beauties, and you know the price is going to be climbing again.\n\nChipotle is one of the best restaurant stocks on the planet, with more than 3,400 locations dishing out its freshly made Tex-Mex fare.\n\nSecond-quarter results won\u2019t be out until late July, but the company had a solid first quarter with revenue of $2.7 billion rising by 14.1% from a year ago. Chipotle also reported that comparable restaurant sales were up an impressive 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%.\n\nCMG stock is up 45% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the owner of some of the most popular social media and advertising platforms on the planet, including Instagram, Facebook, Threads and WhatsApp.\n\nWhile many call Meta purely a social media company, it will always be an advertising powerhouse in my book \u2014 especially considering that it saw roughly 98% of its revenue come from advertising in the first quarter.\n\nMeta\u2019s advertising is so popular because they do it right. Meta has amassed an amazing amount of data about its users, including hobbies and interests, locations and their social networks. They use that information to allow advertisers to precisely target offerings to the people who are most likely to buy a product.\n\nMeta is also making an effort in the AI world with Meta AI, a large language model that would be capable of answering queries, solving problems and performing other functions on Meta\u2019s platforms.\n\nMeta will continue to be a workhorse for your portfolio. The stock is up 44% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThat brings us to Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), which is truly a legacy technology company. The company made its name as a manufacturer of computers laptops and mobile devices, but its future is in AI as well.\n\nNvidia has a key partnership with Dell, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang touts that Dell\u2019s large server business makes it easier for companies to get into AI.\n\nDell and Nvidia are working hand-in-hand to create an AI factory that would help xAI, the artificial intelligence venture fronted by Elon Musk, create an AI supercomputer to power the Grok chatbot, among other things.\n\nMusk says that Dell will assemble half the racks that are going to be used for the xAI supercomputer. Supermicro is also involved in the effort.\n\nAll this will be important for Dell stock moving forward. DELL is up 83% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) The Netflix (NFLX) logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.\n\nSource: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust a few years ago, I think it would have been fair to have legitimate concerns about Netflix.\n\nThe company seemed to have hit a wall \u2014 subscription growth was weak, other streaming services were taking off, stripping Netflix of some of its most popular content (such as the Star Wars franchise, the Marvel franchise and hit sitcoms like Friends and The Office).\n\nBut wow, did Netflix turn things around, or what?\n\nThe biggest move that it made was ending the password-sharing practice that Netflix had long turned a blind eye to. It recognized that its platform was still desirable, and that people were willing to pay for it.\n\nSo it instituted an $8 surcharge for people who were sharing their accounts with someone outside of their platform \u2014 kids in college, former roommates and ex-romantic partners, for instance.\n\nThat left customers with the choice of paying the surcharge or allowing those external household members to get their own accounts. Both decisions are a win for Netflix.\n\nEarnings in the first quarter showed revenue of $9.3 billion, up from $8.1 billion a year ago. Global streaming paid memberships hit 269.6 million, up 16% from a year ago, and net income was $2.06 million, up from $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNetflix is still special and still growing, and it\u2019s the premiere streaming service on the market. The stock is up 38% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) isn\u2019t a tech stock, but its made what may be one of the most popular breakthroughs of the decade. The biotech company created a drug that\u2019s approved by the Food and Drug Administration to help people lose weight.\n\nZepbound is an injectable drug that won FDA approval in November 2023 and is geared to the 42% of the U.S. population that are classified as obese. The drug in Zepbound, tirzepatide, is also used in another highly successful Lilly product called Mounjaro, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhile Lilly is now pouring billions of dollars into expanding its manufacturing facilities to produce Zepbound and Mounjaro, the company has another amazing drug around the corner.\n\nAn FDA panel voted unanimously in favor of the company\u2019s\u00a0donanemab drug, which would be used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. The full FDA still needs to give final approval, but that\u2019s fully expected to happen soon.\n\nThese catalysts make LLY stock a must-own for 2024.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw Super Micro Computer (SMCI) ending at $831.16, denoting a -1.42% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.16%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.04%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.49%.\n\nThe server technology company's shares have seen a decrease of 3.61% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 5.94% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.22%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Super Micro Computer will be of great interest to investors. On that day, Super Micro Computer is projected to report earnings of $8.08 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 130.2%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $5.3 billion, indicating a 142.58% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $23.82 per share and revenue of $14.93 billion, indicating changes of +101.69% and +109.66%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Super Micro Computer. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. At present, Super Micro Computer boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, Super Micro Computer is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 35.4. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 27.02.\n\nInvestors should also note that SMCI has a PEG ratio of 0.68 right now. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Computer- Storage Devices industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.54.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer- Storage Devices industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

        "content": "Most investors gravitate toward the\u00a0Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 when they think about stock market indices, but it is also worth considering Russell 2000 stocks to buy. Some stock screeners let you shortlist stocks from either of these indices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, not every stock screener lets you filter\u00a0Russell 2000 stocks.\n\nThe Russell 2000 is filled with lesser-known stocks. In some cases, it\u2019s best off, as a bunch of the stocks in the Russell 2000 are losing value. The index is flat year-to-date and has only gained 30% over the past five years. It\u2019s a low bar to clear for many stocks, and most of the Russell 2000 stocks don\u2019t hit the mark.\n\nHowever, some stocks in the index crush the stock market and still have reasonable valuations.\u00a0Super MicroComputer (NASDAQ:SMCI) was in the Russell 2000 before it was added to the S&P 500. That stock is up by more than 4,000% over the past five years, and a few stocks in the Russell 2000 ended up with quadruple-digit gains within a few years. Here are the three Russell 2000 stocks to buy:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is flat year-to-date but has gained 55% over the past year. The search engine marketing tool is a popular resource for many small businesses, content creators, and corporations. The firm has roughly 112,000 paying customers who have subscription plans.\n\nMost of Semrush\u2019s revenue is recurring. Annual recurring revenue came to $354.2 million in Q1 2024, which is up by 21% year-over-year. Revenue also increased by 21% year-over-year to reach $85.8 million for the quarter. The company uses artificial intelligence to strengthen its core product and to incentivize current customers to upgrade their plans. Semrush anticipates 20% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2024. Based on guidance, full-year revenue growth should range from 19% to 20%.\n\nSemrush recently became profitable and delivered a\u00a0GAAP net income of $2.14 million, compared to a net loss of $9.86 million in the same quarter last year. Rising profits should lead to a more attractive valuation for long-term investors.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.\n\nSource: Funstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) enjoyed quite the run during the pandemic but remains more than 80% removed from its all-time high. While the 5-year chart and a 27% year-to-date loss don\u2019t look promising, Upwork may be on the way to a recovery.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a 31 P/E ratio and is delivering higher profits. Revenue increased by 19% year-over-year in the\u00a0first quarter, while\u00a0net income was up by 7% year-over-year. Profit margins should expand considerably in the upcoming quarters since Upwork\u2019s advertising segment is growing faster than any other part of the company\u2019s business. Upwork also surpassed 100,000 active Freelancer Plus subscriptions, which\u00a0represents a 76% year-over-year improvement.\n\nStory continues\n\nRemote work is here to stay, and more people want flexibility with how and when they work. Upwork offers that flexibility by connecting freelancers with job opportunities. The freelance marketplace stands to benefit greatly as more people pick up side hustles and seek ways to work from home.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is one of the Russell 2000 stocks that has comfortably outperformed the stock market. It demonstrates what can happen if investors dig deeper into the index and find promising opportunities. Shares are up by 46% year-to-date and have soared more than 1,300% over the past five years.\n\nElf Beauty won\u2019t remain in the Russell 2000 for long, as it will\u00a0join the Russell 1000 on June 28th. The cosmetics firm produces beauty products that use cruelty-free ingredients, and it\u2019s been a big hit with Gen Z. The company recently reported 71% year-over-year net sales growth in Q4 FY24 and gained market share for the 5th consecutive year. Elf Beauty also had its 21st consecutive quarter of net sales growth.\n\nLeadership indicated that Elf Beauty\u2019s high growth should continue into fiscal 2025, and Wall Street analysts also seem optimistic about the stock. Elf Beauty is currently rated as a\u00a0Strong Buy, and the highest price target of $250 per share suggests a potential 23% upside.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in ELF.

        "title": "3 Amazing Growth Stocks That Turned $30,000 Into More Than $1 Million in 10 Years",
        "content": "Investing in tech stocks yielded some magnificent, life-changing returns for investors. And specifically, companies with exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) performed exceptionally well in recent years. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) generated more than 30x returns in a span of just the past 10 years. Here's how much a $30,000 investment into these stocks a decade ago would be worth today, and why they could still be good buys right now.\n\nNvidia: $8.1 million\n\nA $30,000 investment into chipmaker Nvidia back in 2014 would be worth more than $8.1 million now. That amounts to an astonishing return of around 27,000%. Shares of Nvidia have been taking off in the past few years due to the rapid emergence of AI models and chatbots, which it is poised to help grow with its AI chips.\n\nAs a leading company and the brand that's most recognizable with AI these days, Nvidia benefited the most from the growing excitement in tech. A particularly strong segment of its business is in data centers. In its most recent quarter, which ended on April 28, that segment generated $22.6 billion in sales, which soared 427% when compared to the prior-year period. Nvidia's overall sales growth of 262% has already been incredible, but its data center numbers stand out even more.\n\nBetween gaming, data centers, automotive revenue, and other opportunities, this is a business that still has much more room to get bigger. While Nvidia is at a $3 trillion market cap and is trading at more than 70 times earnings, given its dominance in AI, it can still be a good stock to buy and hold. But with an already large market cap, investors should be careful to temper their expectations for the AI stock. It would be extremely difficult for it to replicate the type of returns it has generated over the past 10 years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices: $1.2 million\n\nAnother chipmaker to make this list is Advanced Micro Devices, better known as AMD. Although it hasn't been generating as impressive numbers as Nvidia has, its returns have still been phenomenal over the years.\n\nAMD's business is much smaller than Nvidia's and its chips aren't in as high demand as Nvidia's are, at least not yet, as AMD has been a slower in launching AI-powered chips than its rival. During the first three months of the year, AMD reported $5.5 billion in net revenue, which rose by a fairly modest 2% year over year. And while the business is profitable, its margin has recently been in the single digits, whereas Nvidia's is well above even 40%.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors haven't been as bullish on AMD and while it has been a hot buy over the years, it hasn't spiked as drastically as Nvidia has in the past few years due to AI. It's a good growth opportunity for the business, but it isn't leading to a surge in sales, for now, anyway. CEO Lisa Su, however, believes there's still a lot of room to achieve better results in the future. \"Moving forward, we are well positioned to continue driving revenue growth and margin improvement while investing in the large AI opportunities ahead,\" she said in the company's first-quarter earnings release.\n\nAt a much smaller market cap of $260 billion, AMD is a potentially underrated AI stock to buy; it's up just 9% this year. For investors who are willing to be patient, AMD could be a good buy as it's still a top chip company and although it may not be doing as well as Nvidia, with a more modest market cap, it may have more room to generate larger returns down the road.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: $1.06 million\n\nThe last AI stock to round out this list is Super Micro Computer, often referred to as just Supermicro. The company's server and storage system solutions are pivotal for companies looking to ramp up their infrastructure and strengthen their AI capabilities. As with Nvidia, the past few years have been particularly strong for the stock.\n\nBusiness has been booming for Supermicro with sales growth of over 200% in its most recent quarter (which ended on March 31) as its top line jumped from less than $1.3 billion a year ago to nearly $3.9 billion. It has also generated some decent 10% margins during the period. For the full fiscal year, which ends in June, it expects its top line to come in at around $15 billion, which would be more than 4 times the $3.6 billion it posted for fiscal 2021.\n\nAt a market cap of just over $50 billion, Supermicro isn't nearly as large of a stock as Nvidia or AMD. Its valuation is arguably also the most attractive, at a price-to-earnings multiple of 50. For AI investors, this may be a good growth stock to consider buying as companies will need data centers and better infrastructure as they develop their AI capabilities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Executed a 10-for-1 Stock Split. 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could be Next.",
        "content": "Nvidia stock soared to record highs following its 10-for-1 split. Following that increase, it became the stock with the world's largest market cap. Another chip giant, Broadcom, is far from such an achievement but has shot higher since announcing its own split.\n\nGiven those reactions, such a move could be next for other AI stocks that announce stock splits. The question for investors is which stocks will make such a move. While the answer to that question remains to be seen, a similar increase could happen for the following stocks:\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) should emerge as a stock-split candidate. Despite a worldwide reach and a stock that has traded since 2007, it was a server manufacturer largely unknown outside its industry.\n\nThat changed when it and Nvidia announced a partnership. Consequently, Supermicro stock has outperformed Nvidia's over the last year. SMCI Chart\n\nThe increase briefly took its share price above $1,000 in March, and despite the surge, it could be undervalued.\n\nThanks to revenue growth estimated to reach 110% this year, analysts forecast nearly $24 per share in net income. That is quite a feat, considering that its share price was $24 as recently as four years ago.\n\nDespite that increase, Supermicro's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 52, which is a low valuation given the growth rate. That growth and the possible catalyst of a lower nominal share price after a split could be what Supermicro needs to keep moving higher.\n\nASML\n\nASML(NASDAQ: ASML) remains a relatively unknown semiconductor stock. Nonetheless, it is one of the most crucial chip companies because it builds the most advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines.\n\nHence, manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung need its machines to make their cutting-edge chips.\n\nMoreover, countries want to move more manufacturing away from Taiwan, the island that produces about two-thirds of the world's chips. That fear has led to tens of billions in subsidies going into ASML's industry.\n\nThe AI-driven demand for chips has become a boon to ASML as chip fabricators scramble to increase capacity. Investors looking to capitalize on the AI boom have bid its stock price higher, and it is up more than 430% over the last five years, taking its stock price to around $1,050 as of this writing.\n\nThe run-up has taken the P/E to a lofty 54. Nonetheless, the demand for EUV machines likely means its long-term growth continues, and a split in the near future improves the chances of ASML moving higher in the short term as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAs one of the largest cloud providers, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) plays a key role in running AI applications. It was one of the companies that built an alliance with OpenAI, whose ChatGPT platform makes it a more crucial AI company.\n\nThat led investors to bid the stock price higher by more than 30% over the last year, giving Microsoft the world's largest market cap for most of the year.\n\nAmid its rising value, the company still trades at around $450 per share, which might not inspire most companies to split shares in today's market.\n\nHowever, investors often forget that it is one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Since that is a price-weighted index, a higher nominal price gives Microsoft a disproportionate influence over the Dow. Thus, the index tends to pressure its members to split their stocks when the price becomes high.\n\nGiven the bump that benefited Nvidia and Broadcom, such pressure could be a blessing in disguise. A stock split could give Microsoft investors a reason to bid its stock higher despite its 39 P/E ratio, possibly meaning a split will happen sooner rather than later.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

Super Micro stock was up a jaw-dropping 318% year to date in mid-March.\n\nThe IT solutions provider isn't just enjoying a great year; it's had a fantastic decade. Ten years ago, Super Micro Computer's market cap was less than $1.2 billion. It reported revenue of $1.16 billion in the previous fiscal year with a profit of only $21.3 million.\n\nToday, Super Micro Computer's market cap tops $49.3 billion. Wall Street expects the company to generate revenue of nearly $15 billion in its fiscal year ending June 30.\n\nWhat put the \"super\" in Super Micro Computer this year\n\nWhy is Super Micro Computer stock performing so well in 2024? In large part, for the same reason it soared 246% last year: surging demand for servers and storage systems driven by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSuper Micro's success has gone hand-in-hand with Nvidia's. In its latest quarter, the company saw record demand for its AI rack scale direct liquid cooling (DLC) systems, including those running Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). Super Micro was the first to market development for Nvidia's GH200 (Grace Hopper) and GB200 (Blackwell) platforms.\n\nIt also helped that Super Micro Computer was added to the S&P 500 index in March. As a result, all mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the S&P 500 had to buy shares of Super Micro.\n\nThere has been only one development that has weighed on Super Micro's soaring share price. On March 19, the company announced a public stock offering of 2 million shares. Although it's not surprising that Super Micro took advantage of its tremendous share price gains to raise money, the move diluted the value of existing shares.\n\nIs Super Micro Computer stock still a smart pick?\n\nThe AI boom shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Nvidia's executives disclosed that the demand for its forthcoming Blackwell GPUs is through the roof -- a great sign for Super Micro.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo is Super Micro Computer stock still a smart pick after its sizzling gains? Valuation could become a problem if the demand for AI systems slows. Cautious investors will probably be better off looking elsewhere.\n\nHowever, Super Micro's forward earnings multiple around 26 isn't too steep considering the company's growth prospects over the next few years. Aggressive investors with long-term perspectives could still profit from the S&P 500's top stock of 2024 so far.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 26, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Micron Technology Inc. MU, Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, Dell Technologies Inc. DELL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nCatch These 5 Big Fish at Next Dips for Long-Term Gains\n\nWall Street is set to close a successful first half of 2024 after an impressive 2023. Aside from large-cap stocks, mid caps have also performed well year to date. Though the rally is primarily driven by generative artificial intelligence (AI), several old-economy stocks have also flourished.\n\nThe bull run is expected to continue in the second half supported by a resilient U.S. economy, a declining inflation rate, solid earnings results, and Fed\u2019s indication of at least one rate cut of 25 basis points this year and a full 1% cut in the benchmark interest rate in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, several stocks with strong exposure to AI, have skyrocketed year to date. These stocks have helped the broad-market index \u2014 the S&P 500 \u2014 to post 31 all-time highs this year and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to surge nearly 18.5% after jumping 43.4% in 2023. Both indexes are currently trading near their all-time highs.\n\nA section of market participants is now skeptical about the continuity of the AI frenzy and the price momentum of these high-flying stocks. I believe a lot more is yet to come for these tech heavyweights and every dip in these stocks will be a good entry point for long-term gains.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s tremendous performance, many financial experts started claiming that U.S. markets are overvalued. Concerns regarding the overvaluation of stocks, especially technology stocks, have stuck around since the beginning of this year.\n\nOn Jan 5, I wrote that buying on the dip would be the best strategy this year. (Read: Best Investment Strategy for 2024: Buy on the Dip). In the first half, this strategy has proven right. Every dip in stocks, especially in tech giants, has resulted in more aggressive returns in a short span. This trend is likely to last in the second half, too.\n\nTop Picks\n\nHere, I have selected five U.S. behemoths with robust upside left for the long term. Every dip in their stock prices should call for a prudent buy to maximize long-term returns.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is expected to benefit in two ways. Demand for its Hopper chips remains strong owing to the significant adoption of generative AI and an industry-wide shift from central processors to NVDA-made accelerators. On the other hand, demand is likely to outpace supply, resulting in price hikes for NVIDIA chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis undisputed global leader in the generative AI chipset developer space is aggressively differentiating its products. On May 22, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company\u2019s next-generation AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, would be the next driver. These chips will be available in data centers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nOn Jun 2, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called \u201cRubin.\u201d The Rubin architecture will have new GPUs to launch AI systems, CPUs and networking chips. Rubin is set to be introduced in 2026. NVIDIA will introduce an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nNVDA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 92.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe company currently has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 37.6%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 18.4%.\n\nThe stock price has soared more than 138.5% year to date. Despite this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 2.7% from the last closing price of $118.11. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $69-$200. Thus, every dip has a strong upside potential. Finally, NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. has been benefiting from the enormous growth of AI applications that boosted demand for its high bandwidth memory chips. MU is a major producer of memory chips used in NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs. MU is benefiting from improved market conditions, robust sales executions and strong growth across multiple business units.\n\nMicron Technology anticipates the pricing of DRAM and NAND chips to increase, thereby improving its revenues. The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI servers, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supply. Also, 5G adoption in IoT devices and wireless infrastructure will spur demand for memory and storage.\n\nMicron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 58.9% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.4% over the last seven days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 69.6%.\n\nThe stock price of Micron Technology has climbed 62.9% year to date. Notwithstanding this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 7.3% from the last closing price of $139.01. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $100 -$225. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. has benefited on the back of robust demand for severs powered by high-end generative AI chipsets. SMCI designs, develops, manufactures, and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.\n\nAn astonishing rise in demand for high-performance rack servers boosted SMCI\u2019s top and bottom lines. The company makes servers using NVIDIA processors. Super Micro Computer is positioned as a leading provider of one-stop-shop, high-performance rack servers capable of powering advanced AI applications.\n\nSMCI\u2019s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI\u2019s Server Building Block Solutions provide benefits across many environments, including data center deployment, high-performance computing, high-end workstations, storage networks and standalone server installations.\n\nSMCI has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 60.1% and 44.1%, respectively, for next year (ending June 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 18.5% over the last 60 days.\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 52.4%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 7%.\n\nThe stock price has skyrocketed 191% year to date. Yet, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 8.3% from the last closing price of $826.98. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $285-$1,500. Super Micro Computer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2).\n\nDell Technologies Inc. has expanded its AI offerings in partnership with NVIDIA with \"new server, edge, workstation, solutions and services advancements.\" On May 20, DELL announced the new Dell PowerEdge XE9680L server, which \"offers direct liquid cooling and eight NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs for fast processing in a compact form factor.\"\n\nDELL is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers driven by the ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications. DELL\u2019s PowerEdge XE9680 AI-optimized server is in demand. Strong enterprise demand for AI-optimized servers is aiding DELL.\n\nDell Technologies has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.4% and 9.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.8%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 27.7%.\n\nThe stock price of this Zacks Rank #1 company has jumped 79.9% year to date. Despite this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 10% from the last closing price of $137.56. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $97-$186.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive for AMZN.\n\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN\u2019s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home offerings are tailwinds. The advertising business is also pretty robust. AMZN enjoys a strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are its other positives.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.3% over the last 60 days.\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 29.6%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 48.2%.\n\nThe stock price of Amazon.com has surged 22.2% year to date. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 16.9% from the last closing price of $185.57. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $140-$246. The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #3. However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2).\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Prediction: After Nvidia and Broadcom Stock Splits, This Artificial Intelligence Stock Will Be Next",
        "content": "Stock splits have taken the market by storm, with a broad range of companies announcing these operations to lower high-flying share prices. This is good news in general, showing these players and the market have been doing well. And the operations themselves are positive because they make it easier for a wider range of investors to buy the particular stock.\n\nThe tech world has leaped to center stage in this movement, with artificial intelligence (AI) giants Nvidia and Broadcom announcing 10-for-1 stock splits in recent times. Nvidia completed its operation on June 7, and Broadcom is set to execute its split next month. This is as shares of both companies soared well beyond $1,000, a price that -- even if valuation looks reasonable -- may represent a psychological barrier for some investors.\n\nNow, investors are looking ahead and wondering which other top-performing technology stocks may join the stock split party. My prediction is an equipment maker, one that has seen revenue soar thanks to AI demand, may be next to launch a split. And the announcement could even come during that company's upcoming earnings report. Let's check out this potential stock split winner. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA stock trading for more than $800\n\nThe company I'm referring to is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of servers, workstations, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment needed in AI data centers. Super Micro shares have soared more than 4,000% over the past five years, reaching more than $800 today. They actually surpassed $1,000 earlier this year but have since come down from those record levels.\n\nWe can't look to Super Micro's past actions for clues about whether it may split its stock, as the company's situation several years ago is much different from its situation today. The equipment maker has never launched a stock split -- but a split wasn't necessary throughout most of Super Micro's 30-year history, because for much of that time, the stock traded for less than $20 a share.\n\nOver the years, Super Micro steadily grew its revenue, but it only truly took off as the AI boom gathered momentum. Demand for Super Micro's products soared, and this resulted in the company reporting its first $3 billion quarter this year -- that was the amount of revenue it generated in a full year as recently as 2021.\n\nToday, it's logical to imagine Super Micro's stock continuing its gains and even returning to $1,000 and beyond as this AI growth story continues. The company said in recent earnings reports that demand for its full rack scale systems, including top chips from Nvidia and other market giants, has remained at record levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nA $1 trillion AI market\n\nAnd this movement probably isn't over -- for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, the actual AI market is in the early days of its growth story, with analysts predicting an increase from $200 billion today to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. Second, Super Micro works closely with Nvidia and other chip leaders to immediately integrate their latest innovations in its products. And since Super Micro's products share many common parts, building and customizing can be done rapidly -- something customers appreciate.\n\nFinally, Super Micro offers products equipped with its liquid cooling technology, an extremely important feature for AI data centers due to the heat created by AI processes. Super Micro chief executive Charles Liang, speaking at the recent Computex event, said he expects 15% of the company's shipped racks this year to include liquid cooling, and that number should increase to 30% by next year, according to The Register.\n\nSo revenue has soared at Super Micro, and the future looks bright, offering the shares reason to head higher. And this means it's the perfect moment for the company to announce a stock split, a move that allows investors with smaller budgets to invest without relying on fractional shares. Nvidia and Broadcom, when announcing their splits, both said their motive was to make it easier for employees and others to buy their shares.\n\nAnd if Super Micro announces a split, the move also shows management is confident in the company's future -- and in the share price's potential, from the new lower level, to take off once again.\n\nShould you buy Super Micro or wait?\n\nConsidering all of this, as an investor, should you buy Super Micro now, or wait to see if my prediction is right and the company announces a split?\n\nThough a potential split is positive, it isn't a catalyst for share price moves and doesn't change anything fundamental. The company's market value and valuation remain the same -- so if you wait for a potential stock split, the per-share price would be lower, but you won't necessarily be getting a bargain. As we see in the case of Nvidia, the stock is more expensive today than it was prior to its recent stock split.\n\nSo this means if you want to benefit from the Super Micro story, there's no reason to wait for a potential stock split to buy. Now is a great time to get in on this AI growth stock and hold on for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Wall Street is set to close a successful first half of 2024 after an impressive 2023. Aside from large-cap stocks, mid caps have also performed well year to date. Though the rally is primarily driven by generative artificial intelligence (AI), several old-economy stocks have also flourished.\n\nThe bull run is expected to continue in the second half supported by a resilient U.S. economy, a declining inflation rate, solid earnings results, and Fed\u2019s indication of at least one rate cut of 25 basis points this year and a full 1% cut in the benchmark interest rate in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, several stocks with strong exposure to AI, have skyrocketed year to date. These stocks have helped the broad-market index \u2014 the S&P 500 \u2014 to post 31 all-time highs this year and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to surge nearly 18.5% after jumping 43.4% in 2023. Both indexes are currently trading near their all-time highs.\n\nA section of market participants is now skeptical about the continuity of the AI frenzy and the price momentum of these high-flying stocks. I believe a lot more is yet to come for these tech heavyweights and every dip in these stocks will be a good entry point for long-term gains.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s tremendous performance, many financial experts started claiming that U.S. markets are overvalued. Concerns regarding the overvaluation of stocks, especially technology stocks, have stuck around since the beginning of this year.\n\nOn Jan 5, I wrote that buying on the dip would be the best strategy this year. (Read: Best Investment Strategy for 2024: Buy on the Dip). In the first half, this strategy has proven right. Every dip in stocks, especially in tech giants, has resulted in more aggressive returns in a short span. This trend is likely to last in the second half, too.\n\nTop Picks\n\nHere, I have selected five U.S. behemoths with robust upside left for the long term. Every dip in their stock prices should call for a prudent buy to maximize long-term returns.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is expected to benefit in two ways. Demand for its Hopper chips remains strong owing to the significant adoption of generative AI and an industry-wide shift from central processors to NVDA-made accelerators. On the other hand, demand is likely to outpace supply, resulting in price hikes for NVIDIA chips.\n\nThis undisputed global leader in the generative AI chipset developer space is aggressively differentiating its products. On May 22, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company\u2019s next-generation AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, would be the next driver. These chips will be available in data centers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Jun 2, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called \u201cRubin.\u201d The Rubin architecture will have new GPUs to launch AI systems, CPUs and networking chips. Rubin is set to be introduced in 2026. NVIDIA will introduce an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nNVDA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 92.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.7% over the last 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company currently has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 37.6%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 18.4%.\n\nThe stock price has soared more than 138.5% year to date. Despite this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 2.7% from the last closing price of $118.11. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $69-$200. Thus, every dip has a strong upside potential. Finally, NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. MU has been benefiting from the enormous growth of AI applications that boosted demand for its high bandwidth memory chips. MU is a major producer of memory chips used in NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs. MU is benefiting from improved market conditions, robust sales executions and strong growth across multiple business units.\n\nMicron Technology anticipates the pricing of DRAM and NAND chips to increase, thereby improving its revenues. The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI servers, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supply. Also, 5G adoption in IoT devices and wireless infrastructure will spur demand for memory and storage.\n\nMicron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 58.9% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.4% over the last seven days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 69.6%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock price of Micron Technology has climbed 62.9% year to date. Notwithstanding this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 7.3% from the last closing price of $139.01. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $100 -$225. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. SMCI has benefited on the back of robust demand for severs powered by high-end generative AI chipsets. SMCI designs, develops, manufactures, and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.\n\nAn astonishing rise in demand for high-performance rack servers boosted SMCI\u2019s top and bottom lines. The company makes servers using NVIDIA processors. Super Micro Computer is positioned as a leading provider of one-stop-shop, high-performance rack servers capable of powering advanced AI applications.\n\nSMCI\u2019s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI\u2019s Server Building Block Solutions provide benefits across many environments, including data center deployment, high-performance computing, high-end workstations, storage networks and standalone server installations.\n\nSMCI has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 60.1% and 44.1%, respectively, for next year (ending June 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 18.5% over the last 60 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 52.4%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 7%.\n\nThe stock price has skyrocketed 191% year to date. Yet, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 8.3% from the last closing price of $826.98. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $285-$1,500. Super Micro Computer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2).\n\nDell Technologies Inc. DELL has expanded its AI offerings in partnership with NVIDIA with \"new server, edge, workstation, solutions and services advancements.\" On May 20, DELL announced the new Dell PowerEdge XE9680L server, which \"offers direct liquid cooling and eight NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs for fast processing in a compact form factor.\"\n\nDELL is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers driven by the ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications. DELL\u2019s PowerEdge XE9680 AI-optimized server is in demand. Strong enterprise demand for AI-optimized servers is aiding DELL.\n\nDell Technologies has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.4% and 9.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.8%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 27.7%.\n\nThe stock price of this Zacks Rank #1 company has jumped 79.9% year to date. Despite this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 10% from the last closing price of $137.56. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $97-$186.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive for AMZN.\n\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN\u2019s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home offerings are tailwinds. The advertising business is also pretty robust. AMZN enjoys a strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are its other positives.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.3% over the last 60 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 29.6%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 48.2%.\n\nThe stock price of Amazon.com has surged 22.2% year to date. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 16.9% from the last closing price of $185.57. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $140-$246. The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #3. However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Brown Capital Management, an investment management company, released its \u201cThe Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund\u201d first quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The Small Company Fund returned 0.48%, significantly underperforming the Russell 2000 Growth index\u2019s 7.58% return. Following the release of the inflation report in February, the Small Company Fund experienced underperformance as investors shifted away from high-growth companies, impacting their valuations. In addition, check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nThe Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund highlighted stocks like Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), in the first quarter 2024 investor letter. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) develops and manufactures high-performance server and storage solutions. The one-month return of Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) was -5.46%, and its shares gained 265.65% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On June 24, 2024, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock closed at $826.98 per share with a market capitalization of $48.425 billion.\n\nThe Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund stated the following regarding Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"We are benchmark-agnostic, so we spend our time researching current or potential EGCs, not analyzing indexes. However, this quarter there was inescapable attention on one AI-related company, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), which makes servers that hold Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) graphics processing units. Pundits wondered if Super Micro was the next AI \u201cmeme stock\u201d set to soar like Nvidia. Super Micro\u2019s stock price was up 255% in the first quarter and indeed is up a jaw-dropping 848% in the last year. Importantly, Super Micro is in the Russell 2000\u00ae Growth index, and alone accounted for over a third, or 2.82%, of the index\u2019s 7.58% total return this quarter. However, Super Micro is not a company we could have ever owned. The company generated more than $7 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year, far above our current maximum revenue threshold. In fact, when the company came public in March 2007, it was already too large for our portfolio. Now, the company is so large that it moved into the S&P 500 index at the end of the first quarter. Nevertheless, not owning Super Micro was the largest detractor to our performance versus the index this quarter, comprising more than one-third of our underperformance. This, to us, is a reminder why an index is not always an accurate gauge of our short-term performance.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA team of technicians in a server room, testing and managing the newest server solutions.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc.

        "content": "While the Nasdaq composite has delivered a total return of about 20% this year, there are certain Nasdaq stocks for long-term growth that industry analysts consider primed for future success.\n\nLet\u2019s go through some of these three Nasdaq stocks revolutionizing their respective industries, and how experts gauge their long-term performance.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the leading player in the robotics market right now. The company leverages its GPU technologies and advanced AI capabilities to drive innovation across industries such as gaming, automotive, high-performance computers, and robotics.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIts Omnivers platform delivers the capabilities that enable creators, professionals, developers, and even students globally to build, operate, and connect metaverse applications. Within the platform, developers can develop, train, and test robotics using the built-in NVIDIA accelerated libraries and application frameworks, as well as other available AI models.\n\nBut that is not all, NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX\u2122 is a dream come true for gamers, providing next-level fast and clear graphics that make gaming livelier. The company has also invested heavily in automotive design resources and AI experience. All of which are accessible on its Omniverse platform. Leading in almost all futuristic industries, such as AI and robotics, it is no surprise that NVIDIA just surprised Apple as the highest-valued company globally.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s EPS for the 12 months ending April 30, 2024, hit $1.71, a 790.1% increase YoY. It\u2019s market cap also hit this $3 trillion dollar mark, which puts it in swiping distance of becoming the stock market\u2019s largest company.\n\nAnalysts don\u2019t expect NVIDIA to slow down any time soon, with the recent announcement that it intends to collaborate with numerous automotive manufacturers to integrate its automotive feature, DRIVE Orin, into next-generation vehicles, adding to its prospect as a Nasdaq long-term growth stock.\n\nPinduoduo Holdings (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPinduoduo Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is a Chinese online retailer originally focusing on agricultural products. The company has, however, diversified to a full-scale retail platform that allows all kinds of products.\n\nYou probably know Pinduoduo through its e-commerce platform, Temu, which has shaken online retail fabric with ridiculously cheap products shipped directly from sellers in China. Temu\u2019s business model is disruptive in that it removes the inline intermediaries and instead connects sellers and buyers directly, enabling sellers in China to ship directly to buyers in the United States.\n\nStory continues\n\nTemu is not a fad, even if its cheap products put the company\u2019s business model and sustainability into question. Removing the intermediaries and the ability for sellers and customers to connect directly on the platform improves the customer experience from whatever angle you look at it, whether you consider improved communication, tracking of orders, or even price negotiations. It has brought the time-tested Chinese-style bargain e-commerce to this other side of the world.\n\nIt is no wonder PDD stock has been among the best growth stocks recently. The company\u2019s revenue grew by 131% YOY to hit $11.99 billion, surpassing estimates by over 1.41 billion. The stock has also seen over 5.7% increase in the last quarter.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is one of the tech companies riding high on the AI frenzy and making significant gains out of it. The company provides high-performance servers and storage solutions for its clients, leveraging AI technology to meet the rising demand for server and cloud storage.\n\nThe company is significantly investing in expansion to new areas of computing technology, with its Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) technology poised to meet the increasing demand for high-performance computing environments.\n\nSMCI stock prices currently stand at a whopping $905.26, tripling within a year, and industry analysts agree that the company may even leap by 300% by 2026. The company revenue has also seen over 200% surge YoY to 3.85 billion and an EPS of $6.65, a staggering 308% increase. With these statistics, SMCI is one of the Nasdaq stocks for long-term growth and one to put your money on if you want to reap smart in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Drops 6.5%, Dragging Artificial Intelligence Stocks Lower",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) trade took a turn for the worse on Monday as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares dropped as much as 6.5%, dragging the entire AI market with it.\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) fell as much as 8.5%, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) was down 3.8% at its low today. The three AI stocks were down 4.9%, 7%, and 3.2%, respectively, at 11:30 a.m. ET. There isn't any specific news about AI, but investors have a lot on their minds about the future demand for the chips driving AI today.\n\nNvidia insiders are selling in droves\n\nOn Friday, Nvidia insiders, including CEO Jensen Huang, announced massive stock sales beyond just tax sales related to stock options and warrants. Huang reported he sold 240,000 shares on the open market on Thursday and Friday, totaling $31.6 million for just those two days.\n\nIn June alone, Huang has already sold nearly $95 million of stock as he's been touting the growth potential for AI long term. Numerous other executives have also reported large stock sales on the open market.\n\nInsider sales can be an indication they are less bullish on a stock, which is why this is notable.\n\nIs the bubble popping?\n\nAs impressive as AI demand has been, the valuations of Nvidia and Super Micro Computer in particular have hit crazy levels. You can see below that Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is still over 70 and its price-to-sales (P/S) multiple is 37.6. Super Micro Computer isn't quite as expensive, but it's still priced for perfection. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nInvestors must consider how much growth is priced into AI stocks right now and what the likelihood is that they will live up to that potential. Very few AI companies make money, so the money flowing to chips could slow down if those that are developing AI models and tools don't create business plans that make them sustainable in the long term.\n\nEarnings come into focus\n\nInvestors are suddenly thinking about demand because we're only a few weeks away from the start of earnings season for the second quarter of 2024. That's when we'll hear about end demand and margins for tech companies building AI products, including those buying the most Nvidia chips.\n\nIf demand is strong, stocks could go up, but investors are taking money off the table for fear there could be some disappointing signs. And with stocks priced to perfection, even the smallest crack in the AI growth story could send them tumbling.\n\nIt's all up to Nvidia\n\nNvidia is the biggest name in AI, and its fortunes will drive Super Micro Computer and TSMC, which are suppliers to the company and beneficiaries from the overall growth in AI demand. If the market for Nvidia chips continues to grow, the other companies will have plenty of demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat I think the focus over the next month will be is the demand for AI products that companies have introduced and whether or not that will lead to more capital spending. If not, there could be a pullback in orders in the future, and that could put both revenue and margin projections into question.\n\nThese high valuations and lack of AI business models are why I'm avoiding AI stocks today. The risk is simply too high for the observable reward right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this server technology company have returned +2.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. The Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, to which Super Micro belongs, has gained 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nSuper Micro is expected to post earnings of $8.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +130.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +101.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $34.31 indicates a change of +44.1% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Super Micro.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.3 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +142.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.93 billion and $23.92 billion estimates indicate +109.7% and +60.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +200%. EPS of $6.65 for the same period compares with $1.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.89%. The EPS surprise was +15.05%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 59% of the company",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Super Micro Computer's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 16 shareholders own 50% of the company Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 59% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Super Micro Computer.\n\nView our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Super Micro Computer?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Super Micro Computer. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Super Micro Computer's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Super Micro Computer. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are BlackRock, Inc. and Charles Liang, with an equal amount of shares to their name at 9.2%. Charles Liang, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chairman of the Board.\n\nLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Super Micro Computer\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Super Micro Computer, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$53b, and insiders have US$7.6b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Super Micro Computer is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is concerning...\n\nUltimately the future is most important.

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 In Right Now",
        "content": "This may be one of the best times ever to invest in technology stocks as we're facing a game-changing moment. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) is just getting started, and this technology has the potential to revolutionize our daily lives and how many businesses operate. The results could save time and money and even result in major transformations such as the discovery of life-saving medicines. Analysts predict the AI market, valued at about $200 billion right now, could reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nSo now is a great time to invest $50,000 across a basket of stocks present in the area of AI. (This should be part of a diversified strategy so I would only advise investing this entire amount in AI stocks if you already have built a solid portfolio including other industries and stocks. Otherwise, consider investing a smaller portion, according to your investment style, in the following stocks and the rest across quality players in other industries.)\n\nMost of the following AI powerhouses already are winning today -- one is a recovery play -- and they all might have a lot more to gain down the road. You could you, too, if you invest in them early on. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) may be the first stock many investors think of when someone mentions AI. That's because the company dominates the AI chip market, holding an 80% share, and this has helped Nvidia increase earnings in the triple digits in recent quarters.\n\nThe stock price has followed, climbing nearly 200% in the past year, but there's still room for this player to run over time thanks to its commitment to innovation. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) power critical AI tasks like the training and inferencing of models, and they are the fastest on the market. The company isn't standing still, though, and aims to update GPUs on an annual basis -- so Nvidia could stay far ahead of rivals for the long term.\n\nThe next catalyst for Nvidia is a big one, the launch of its Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever later this year. So right now is a great time to get in on this market giant.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is benefiting from AI in two ways. The e-commerce powerhouse has been using AI to streamline and generally improve its operations -- for example, determining the fastest delivery routes for packages. This can lower costs over time and boost earnings, and it also can keep customers coming back as they'll appreciate the optimized services.\n\nAmazon also is a leader in cloud computing, operating the Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, and here, its AI investments are already bearing fruit. AWS offers customers a variety of tools, from chips to a fully managed service featuring large language models to customize for any AI project. And this has helped AWS recently reach a $100 billion annual revenue run rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's important to remember that Amazon also has a long track record of earnings growth and delivers sales and net income in the billions of dollars. So, Amazon makes a solid buy for its long-term strength and AI potential ahead.\n\n3. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has been around for about 30 years, gradually growing revenue, but the business truly took off thanks to the AI boom. The company makes servers, workstations, and full rack scale solutions needed in AI data centers. This has helped Super Micro's earnings soar in recent years, and the stock price has followed.\n\nHere's why this should continue. Super Micro's strategy of working hand-in-hand with the world's top chipmakers allows it to immediately incorporate their chips into its products as soon as they launch. On top of this the company's product lines including many common parts, making the assembly of a customized product fast.\n\nThis speed should keep Super Micro's growth going -- and the company's liquid cooling technology is becoming a key growth driver too. Heat generation in AI data centers is a huge problem, but Super Micro's technology addresses it perfectly.\n\nAll of this makes Super Micro an AI winner today, and this success should continue well into the future.\n\n4. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) fell behind in the AI race over the past few years, but the stock could make a great recovery play right now. Especially since the company has reached an important turning point. Intel recently launched a new portfolio of AI products that could help it carve out a decent share in this market -- and demand is so high that there is room for more than one chip maker to excel.\n\nThe company launched the Gaudi 3 accelerator, one it says may outperform Nvidia's current GPU when it comes to inference and power efficiency -- and at a lower cost.\n\nIntel also may climb as it makes progress to become the world's second-biggest foundry by 2030. The company has opened its manufacturing network to others, meaning it will produce chips for these customers. This won't result in earnings growth overnight, but over the long haul, the results could be big. And that makes now a good time to bet on Intel's future.\n\n5. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) has been in the news lately because it announced a 10-for-1 stock split, set for July. But that isn't the reason to buy this semiconductor and networking giant. The reason to buy the stock has to do with the demand Broadcom is seeing from AI customers as well as growth from its recent acquisition of VMware. Broadcom reported a 43% increase in revenue in the recent quarter to more than $12 billion, and these two elements drove the gains.\n\nThe company makes thousands of products that you'll find anywhere from your smartphone to a data center. This has helped Broadcom grow earnings over time, but the great demand from AI these days could spur a new era of growth.\n\nIn the quarter, AI revenue soared 280% to $3.1 billion, and Broadcom predicts AI revenue will surpass $11 billion for the year. As Broadcom says, the networking of AI accelerators is difficult, but Broadcom has the technology to make it happen -- so there's reason to be optimistic about growth as the AI market develops. And that's why Broadcom is a buy before and after the upcoming stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons Super Micro Computer Could Outperform Nvidia This Year",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are two of the market's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, is a leading producer of dedicated AI servers. Nvidia is the world's largest producer of data center GPUs for processing AI tasks.\n\nIn 2023, Supermicro's stock rallied 246% as Nvidia's stock rose 239%. And since the start of 2024, Supermicro's stock has risen another 223% as Nvidia's stock has advanced 164%. Both stocks are still riding high on the buying frenzy in AI stocks, but I believe Supermicro will continue to perform Nvidia through the end of the year for three simple reasons. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Superior growth rates\n\nSupermicro's revenue and earnings rose 37% and 115%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June) as its sales of dedicated AI servers surged. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 110% and 102%, respectively, in fiscal 2024.\n\nBy comparison, Nvidia's revenue growth flatlined in fiscal 2023 (which ended in January 2023) as adjusted earnings fell 25%. Its sales of gaming graphics processing units (GPUs) declined as macro headwinds throttled its sales of data center chips and people started to adapt to the challenges introduced by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut in fiscal 2024, Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings surged 126% and 288%, respectively, as the explosive growth of the generative AI market lit a raging fire under its sales of data center GPUs and offset its slower sales of gaming GPUs. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 98% and 108%, respectively, in fiscal 2025.\n\nThose growth trajectories are similar, but analysts expect Supermicro to grow faster than Nvidia over the next three years. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, they expect Supermicro's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 58%. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, they expect Nvidia's revenue to rise by a CAGR of 44%.\n\n2. A better diversified business with more growth potential\n\nWe should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but Supermicro seems to have more room to grow than Nvidia. Supermicro currently only controls about 10% of the dedicated AI server market, but Bank of America expects its share to grow to 17% over the next three years as the entire market expands 150%.\n\nThat growth will be supported by its longtime partnership with Nvidia, which grants it access to the chipmaker's high-end data center GPUs before most of its bigger competitors. However, Supermicro has also been developing dedicated AI servers that use Advanced Micro Devices'\u00a0cheaper data center GPUs. That fledgling partnership could gradually reduce Supermicro's dependence on Nvidia. It would also ensure that its server sales keep rising -- even if AMD gains ground against Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia already controls 88% of the discrete GPU market, according to JPR, and it generated 87% of its revenue from its data center GPUs in its latest quarter. Nvidia's core market of data center GPUs is still expanding, but it probably won't generate as much growth through market share gains as Supermicro in the future.\n\n3. A lower valuation\n\nSupermicro's stock has soared over the past few years, but it's still surprisingly cheap at 25 times forward earnings and 2 times its fiscal 2025 sales. Nvidia looks a lot pricier at 50 times forward earnings and 30 times its fiscal 2025 sales. Supermicro's market cap of $54 billion is also tiny compared to Nvidia's market cap of $3.3 trillion.\n\nSupermicro was only recently revalued from a traditional server maker to a high-growth AI stock, so it could have more room to run before it's considered overvalued. Nvidia, however, is starting to look expensive relative to other chip and AI stocks.\n\nBut both stocks are still great long-term AI plays\n\nI believe Supermicro will continue to outperform Nvidia through the end of the year, but both stocks are still great long-term plays for growth-oriented investors. I also think it's still smart to own both Supermicro and Nvidia -- since they operate different business models and focus on different parts of the booming AI market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Super Micro Computer Next?",
        "content": "Stock splits have become trendy on Wall Street. Artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia recently executed a 10-for-1 split, and fellow chip company Broadcom announced its own 10-for-1 split for min-July. Both splits launched shares to record highs.\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has ridden AI tailwinds over the past 18 months, but this stock is still on par with where it traded in mid-February. Maybe now is a good time for the company, which has yet to split its stock, to announce its first-ever stock split.\n\nHere are the potential implications of a stock split that investors need to know about.\n\nHere is what stock splits do (and don't do)\n\nNot many things grab investors' attention like a stock split does. The attention can boost sentiment toward a stock and drive share prices higher. Nvidia's stock price is up 37% since announcing its stock split in May, and Broadcom's stock price jumped 16% since the announcement earlier this month.\n\nBut what exactly is a stock split, and what does it mean for the stock and investors?\n\nA stock split is exactly what it sounds like. It increases the supply of shares by dividing the stock into smaller pieces. Suppose Nvidia was trading at $1,000 per share at the time of its split. A 10-for-1 split would mean that a $1,000 share would become 10 shares worth $100 each. Investors like stock splits because they lower the share price and make accumulating shares easier. Company employees often receive company stock as part of their compensation. They like stock splits because the lower share price allows them to liquidate their equity in smaller increments.\n\nIn other words, stock splits make buying and selling stock easier for investors and employees.\n\nNotably, the share price is lower because each share represents a smaller stake in the company. A split does not change the stock's valuation or any fundamentals about the company. It's like slicing a pizza: More pieces mean more people get some, but the slices are smaller because the whole pizza remains the same size. A split doesn't make a company worth more or less.\n\nWhy a split makes sense for Super Micro Computer\n\nLook up the history of most successful companies, and you'll likely see at least a couple of stock splits. Supermicro, as it is also known, is undoubtedly a successful company -- shares have risen over 10,000% since its IPO in 2007. Every $100 in company stock back then is worth over $10,000 today.\n\nJust imagine how much wealth long-term employees could be sitting on! SMCI Chart\n\nIt makes a lot of sense to split Supermicro's stock and give employees some much-needed liquidity to better control how much stock they may want to cash in. Investors could benefit, too. Shares are almost flat to where they traded four months ago. The added attention of a stock split might help shares get out of this rut and continue their march upward.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould investors buy the stock before a potential split?\n\nInvestors shouldn't buy a stock solely because of a potential stock split. Ultimately, a company's fundamentals will play the most significant role in how a stock performs over time. Fortunately, Supermicro's fundamentals are strong and could support a potential move higher.\n\nShares trade at an elevated forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 39. However, analysts expect massive earnings growth averaging over 50% annually over the next three to five years. The need for Supermicro's modular server racks to quickly deploy AI data centers should continue to boost Supermicro's top and bottom lines. At that pace, the stock's current valuation would be a bargain.\n\nSupermicro's explosive growth potential seems to have investors poised for stellar long-term investment returns.

        "title": "3 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy Before They Soar as Much as 97% According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite, which tracks the stock performance of the more than 3,000 stocks listed on the exchange, hit a new all-time high (again) this week. This marks the 19th time this year the benchmark has ascended to new heights (as of this writing) and its longest winning streak since late 2021. There's likely much more to come, according to numerous sources on Wall Street.\n\nXM Investment analyst Marios Hadjikyriacos is counted among those. \"Stock markets are enjoying the best of all worlds, buoyed by a resilient U.S. economy and speculation that Fed rate cuts are just around the corner, helping to justify stretched valuations,\" he wrote. UBS analyst Mark Haefele is also bullish, noting, \"All-time highs often generate investor concern that markets have peaked. Such worries are not supported by history,\" he counseled concerned investors.\n\nDespite reaching new heights, a number of high-profile Nasdaq stocks still have plenty of room to run and could soar as much as 97%, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside of 53%\n\nThe first Nasdaq stock with plenty of upside is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker has been one of the earliest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution as a picks-and-shovels play. The term references a famous quote attributed to Mark Twain: \"During the gold rush, it's a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.\" In this case, AI is the gold rush, and Nvidia is in the picks-and-shovels business.\n\nMore specifically, Nvidia supplies the gold-standard graphics processing units (GPUs) that process the data, underpinning the latest advances in generative AI. The company was among the earliest converts to AI, turning its focus to the nascent technology more than a decade ago. That prescient move has paid off in a big way, giving Nvidia a significant lead on the competition.\n\nNvidia's most recent results illustrate the magnitude of that lead. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia's revenue soared 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, while earnings per share (EPS) skyrocketed 629% to $5.98. The company's data center segment, which includes AI chips, was the biggest contributor, as revenue of $22.6 billion jumped 427%.\n\nDespite posting a stock price increase of 215% over the past year (as of this writing), Wall Street remains steadfastly positive. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann increased his price target to $200 while maintaining a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential upside of 53% compared to Monday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nMosesmann is bullish on Nvidia's chips but notes that \"the real narrative lies in the software that complements all the hardware goodness.\" The analyst goes on to suggest that Nvidia's market cap will climb to nearly $5 trillion over the coming year.\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Nvidia. Of the 57 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 53 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nAt 52 times forward earnings, Nvidia isn't cheap. However, it's a reasonable price for a company generating triple-digit sales and profit growth and benefiting from such strong secular tailwinds.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside of 69%\n\nAnother Nasdaq stock with additional upside is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro. The company supplies state-of-the-art servers packed with the latest high-end processors designed to provide the computational horsepower necessary for AI.\n\nWhat gives Supermicro an edge is its relentless focus on energy efficiency, assortment of plug-and-play solutions, and building-block architecture. This allows customers to tailor systems to meet their needs and budget. Furthermore, the company offers a wide variety of solutions, including free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air-cooling technology, providing something for everyone.\n\nIn Supermicro's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), revenue soared 201% year over year to $3.85 billion, while its adjusted EPS surged 329% to $6.56. An expansion of its production facilities will help the company meet the accelerating demand, increasing its production potential to support $25 billion in sales annually.\n\nDespite the stock rising a spectacular 301% over the past 12 months, some on Wall Street believe there's more to come. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has a $1,500 price target and a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains of 69% for investors compared to Monday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst cited Supermicro's ability to deliver on both complexity and scale as a reason for its leadership position in the AI server market. He further suggests that Supermicro will deliver a $40 billion revenue run rate by the close of fiscal 2026, well ahead of the company's guidance of $15 billion this year.\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Supermicro. Of the 16 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in April, 12 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nFurthermore, at just 2 times next year's sales, Supermicro is a steal at this price.\n\nBaidu: Implied upside of 97%\n\nThe final Nasdaq stock in our trio with plenty of upside is Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU), often called the \"Google of China.\" According to internet statistics aggregator StatCounter, the company is the dominant provider of internet search in China, with more than 52% of the market. Like its U.S. counterpart, Baidu boasts a veritable treasure trove of data, which forms the backbone of its digital advertising business and generates the lion's share of the company's revenue.\n\nPerhaps as importantly, Baidu is one of China's generative AI leaders, with the capabilities of its Ernie Bot 4.0 rivaling those of OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model.\n\nIn the first quarter, Baidu's total revenue of $4.4 billion edged 1% higher year over year, though its EPS of $2.07 fell 6%. While the struggling Chinese economy weighed on Baidu's results, the company continued to pour money into its AI program, which it said would drive future revenue and profits higher.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst believes a turnaround is on the horizon. Benchmark analyst Fawne Jiang has a buy rating on Baidu stock and a price target of $180. This represents potential upside of 97% compared to Monday's closing price. The analyst points out that this was Baidu's seasonal low quarter for ad revenue, but it was offset by 12% growth from Baidu's AI cloud business, which represents a significant opportunity going forward.\n\nThe analyst is part of a growing cadre on Wall Street that believes Baidu offers a compelling opportunity. Of the 36 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 32 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nFinally, at just 12 times earnings, Baidu has very little growth priced in. Even a modest recovery in China's economy, which some believe has already begun, could send the stock soaring.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks",
        "content": "Buying and holding solid technology stocks for a long time is a tried and tested way of making money in the stock market. This strategy allows investors to both capitalize on the disruptive innovation in this sector and benefit from the power of compounding.\n\nFor instance, a $1,000 investment made in the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index a decade ago is now worth more than $5,000. Of course, the index has had its ups and downs during these 10 years, but investors who were savvy enough to put their money into potential long-term winners have seen their investments grow significantly.\n\nA $5,000 investment in Nvidia a decade ago is now worth almost $1.35 million, suggesting that tech stocks have the ability to make investors millionaires in the long run. Of course, not every tech stock is Nvidia, and investors shouldn't be under the impression that putting their money into a single company could help them become millionaires.\n\nHowever, buying solid tech stocks as part of a diversified portfolio could help you eventually construct a million-dollar portfolio in the long run. Tech stocks Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) are both sitting on massive growth opportunities that could send their shares flying and may even help investors become millionaires.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer, also known as Supermicro, has been one of the top stocks on the market in the past year. An investment of $1,000 in this stock a year ago is now worth $4,000, and it remains a solid buy thanks to its attractive valuation.\n\nSupermicro's price-to-sales ratio of 4.4 and forward earnings multiple of 23 make buying the stock a no-brainer, especially considering its outstanding growth. The company, which makes servers, is on track to finish the current fiscal year with $14.9 billion in revenue, which would be more than double the revenue it generated in the previous fiscal year.\n\nMore importantly, Supermicro is taking steps to ensure that it can remain a fast-growing company for a long time to come. Supermicro recently announced that it is adding three new manufacturing facilities to enhance the production of liquid-cooled server racks. More specifically, the company is looking to more than double the total output of its liquid-cooled server racks from the current capacity of 1,000 per month so that it can cater to the booming artificial intelligence (AI)-related demand.\n\nThis is a smart move. The demand for liquid-cooled data centers is expected to grow at an annual pace of over 24% through the next decade, generating almost $40 billion in revenue in 2033. Meanwhile, sales of AI servers are expected to jump from an estimated $30 billion last year to $150 billion in 2027. Supermicro is benefiting big time from the growing adoption of AI servers and is one of the key players in this space.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has a tremendous growth opportunity ahead that could allow it to maintain its healthy levels of growth for a long time to come. Not surprisingly, analysts are expecting Supermicro's earnings to increase at an annual rate of more than 62% for the next five years. The market could reward such impressive growth with more upside, and Supermicro could turn out to be a top buy for anyone looking to construct a million-dollar portfolio.\n\n2. SoundHound AI\n\nSoundHound AI is another company that's trying to make the most of a disruptive trend in the form of voice AI solutions. Customers can use SoundHound's voice AI platform to design custom wake words, convert text to speech, and build conversational voice assistants, among other solutions.\n\nSoundHound's voice AI platform is witnessing terrific demand already. Its revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was up 73% year over year to $11.6 million. More importantly, the company's full-year revenue guidance of $71 million points toward an acceleration in growth as the year progresses, and it would translate to a 55% jump from last year.\n\nSoundHound is delivering such outstanding growth because it has been able to build a solid customer base across major industries such as restaurants and automotive. In its May quarterly earnings press release, SoundHound said that it has struck deals with multiple quick service restaurants (QSRs) to deploy its voice AI solutions.\n\nMeanwhile, automotive companies such as Stellantis have partnered with SoundHound to deploy generative AI assistants in cars. More importantly, SoundHound says that its solutions are set to be adopted by electric car manufacturers in Asia and the U.S. as well.\n\nThe company's cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog increased 80% year over year in the previous quarter to a healthy $682 million. This metric is a combination of SoundHound's committed customer contracts and the potential revenue that it could get from existing customers where it is a key provider of voice AI solutions. This healthy backlog is the reason analysts are forecasting SoundHound's revenue to increase another 47% in 2025 to $103.6 million.\n\nHowever, the size of the company's backlog suggests that it could keep growing at an elevated pace for a longer period. Moreover, the conversational AI market that SoundHound serves is forecasted to clock an annual growth rate of almost 25% through the end of the decade, generating nearly $50 billion in revenue in 2030.\n\nSoundHound's growth so far indicates that it is outpacing the market. Investors looking to buy an AI stock that could supercharge their portfolios in the long run would do well to take a closer look at SoundHound AI. It has the potential to become a key member of a million-dollar portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company provides solutions that secure human and machine identities across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. The company\u2019s Q1 client acquisition momentum was strong, as seen by the approximately 200 new customers it acquired. A sizable fraction of newly acquired clients utilized many products from CyberArk\u2019s offering, suggesting robust cross-selling prospects and the all-encompassing allure of its platform.

        "title": "Investors are buying into AI, and Musk, any way they can: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe broadening of the stock market rally hasn\u2019t yet arrived as investors keep piling into (just about) anything AI touches.\n\nElon Musk revealed earlier this week that Super Micro (SMCI) will provide hardware for the supercomputer his AI startup is building. That triggered a pop in the stock.\n\nWhen Dell's (DELL) CEO said his company would be building an \"AI factory\" for Musk's xAI in partnership with AI kingpin Nvidia (NVDA), its shares also rose.\n\nAnd though the jumps in both names were short-lived, their performance this year and the response to Musk's one-word post are reminders that what he says matters to a lot of people and that anything related to AI will push markets around.\n\nSo far this year, SMCI is up over 200%. Dell, which to some harkens back to a PC 1.0 world, has seen its stock nearly double.\n\nIt doesn't take a contrived plan or a sideways approach to profit from Wall Street's excitement around AI technology. The main driver of 2024's seemingly unstoppable run is the earnings potential of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, and the platform giants.\n\nCiti analysts, who earlier this week upped their S&P 500 year-end target to 5,600, observed that more than two-thirds of the stock market\u2019s gains so far have flowed from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAnd adding Elon to the mix certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nThe Super Micro news has a clear Musk dimension, and part of the multi-CEO\u2019s dynamism is that his businesses cross into different industries and are themselves interconnected. But since Tesla is the only public Musk company, most investors can only get in on his other ventures indirectly. If you can\u2019t buy into xAI, why not acquire a piece of its suppliers? Elon Musk attends 'Exploring the New Frontiers of Innovation: Mark Read in Conversation with Elon Musk' session during the Cannes Lions International Festival Of Creativity 2024 - Day Three on June 19, 2024, in Cannes, France. (Marc Piasecki/Getty Images) (Marc Piasecki via Getty Images)\n\nA similar dynamic is at play within the world of AI.\n\nThe AI rally extends beyond hardware manufacturers too. Investors attempting to create a makeshift Musk basket of related tech holdings are doing the same thing with Nvidia. Because it's not just the Big Tech platforms churning out apps and productivity software that are drafting off AI exuberance. There's an entire ecosystem out there.\n\nPowering the computer systems that train and run AI systems requires huge amounts of energy. Utility companies are catching a ride on the AI wave.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) are expected to spend a combined $200 billion this year on cloud and AI investments, which will include building and running data centers. In turn, power demand from US data centers is expected to more than double by 2030, in part because of AI, according to estimates from consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nStory continues\n\nGetting in early is nice. But the AI frenzy is proving that getting in at all is more than enough. morning brief image\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) closed at $917.64 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.26% move from the prior day. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.25%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.77%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.79%.\n\nThe server technology company's stock has climbed by 5.35% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.85% and outpacing the S&P 500's gain of 3.59%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Super Micro Computer in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect Super Micro Computer to post earnings of $7.95 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 126.5%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $5.3 billion, showing a 142.58% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $23.51 per share and revenue of $14.93 billion, which would represent changes of +99.07% and +109.66%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Super Micro Computer. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Super Micro Computer currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Super Micro Computer has a Forward P/E ratio of 39.14 right now. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 29.01 for its industry.\n\nInvestors should also note that SMCI has a PEG ratio of 0.75 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer- Storage Devices industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.6 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer- Storage Devices industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 97, finds itself in the top 39% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

        "title": "Dell, Super Micro stocks rise after Musk says companies will supply hardware for xAI",
        "content": "Shares of Dell (DELL) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) popped Thursday after xAI Founder Elon Musk said the companies are providing hardware for the supercomputer his AI startup is building.\n\nThe moves higher underscore Wall Street's excitement around AI technology.\n\nInvestors are clamoring to buy into AI businesses at every level of development, from major consumer-facing brands selling AI-powered apps to manufacturers providing the chips and servers powering the computing infrastructure.\n\nShares of Dell rose as high as 5% Thursday morning while Super Micro's stock climbed nearly 9%.\n\nDell's CEO Michael Dell set up the jump for his company's share price when he said in a post on X Wednesday, \u201cWe\u2019re building a Dell AI factory with Nvidia to power Grok for xAI.\"\n\nMusk, who owns X, clarified a few hours later, that Dell would be assembling half the racks that are going into the supercomputer. In response to comments asking who would be building the remaining half, Musk replied \"SMC.\"\n\nThe AI announcement took place over the Juneteenth holiday, when markets were closed. But investors poured into the stocks the following session. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has led the company as its market cap passed Microsoft on Tuesday, June 18, 2024, to become the most valuable company in the S&P 500. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBoth Dell and Super Micro are working to capitalize on the immense growth surrounding AI technologies. Earlier this week Super Micro announced plans to expand facilities in Silicon Valley to bolster its AI business. And Dell reported last month that revenue from its AI servers more than doubled from the prior quarter.\n\nMusk is also trying to position his startup as a leader in AI, even as tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), which owns Google, have made major inroads. His AI enterprise raised $6 billion in series B funding, backers announced last month, reaching a valuation of $24 billion, as investors bet on the dominant tech platforms as well as upstart challengers in a rapidly escalating AI race.\n\nOther big names are getting in on the AI game, too. Apple (AAPL), whose leaders were reluctant share their AI strategy prematurely, unveiled the company's strategic vision earlier this month. They debuted the Apple Intelligence platform at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference, marking a major shift for the company, which will soon introduce a host of new AI-infused features to its operating systems and products.\n\nEven as the tech giants have enjoyed substantial share price gains riding the momentum of AI development, Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaker that has become an icon of the AI rally, has outshined them all.\n\nOn Thursday Nvidia widened its lead as the world's most valuable company, after moving ahead of Microsoft earlier this week. Shares climbed more than 2%, benefiting from the Dell and Super Micro announcements. It's market cap stood at $3.42 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Super Micro\u2019s X account replied to Musk with a celebration emoji and a link to its website.\n\nRepresentatives for Dell and Super Micro didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment and additional details.\n\nBoth Dell and Super Micro are increasing their server capacity to win more business from companies building and working with artificial intelligence programs, which require more data processing power. Super Micro announced earlier this week that it plans to add three new facilities in Silicon Valley to support AI growth. Dell said last month that revenue from its servers equipped to handle AI tasks more than doubled last quarter from the period before and its backlog jumped.\n\n\u201cDell\u2019s servers are for Elon Musk\u2019s AI startup xAI, and likely to make up half of server volume, with the rest for Super Micro,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Woo Jin Ho. \u201cIf the deployment is for Grok 3, which needs 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, the xAI server deal might be worth $3 billion, assuming a price of $1 million per AI-server rack.\u201d\n\nDell shares were up 5% at 9:51 a.m. in New York. Shares of Super Micro were up 9% and Nvidia\u2019s stock was up 3%.\n\nMusk launched xAI, an artificial intelligence startup, in July 2023 as an answer to OpenAI and its wildly popular chatbot, ChatGPT. Musk was instrumental to OpenAI\u2019s founding, but withdrew his support and warned of the dangers of AI to humanity. The startup launched its ChatGPT competitor Grok last November and raised $6 billion in venture capital funding in May at a pre-money valuation of $18 billion.\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates share prices and adds analyst commentary.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds Documents Show How Musk\u2019s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo Coke\u2014and Dozens of Others\u2014Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "We all know the headline stocks are running up the score when we look for stocks to buy. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), and even Carvana (NASDAQ:CVNA) have all turned in phenomenal performances over the past year that likely minted more than a few new millionaires.\n\nWhat many don\u2019t see are the low-key companies doing the hard work year in and year out that can make investors fabulously wealthy. These overlooked stocks might not be trumpeted from the rooftops, but you would be remiss not to buy them. They are wealth-generating machines and are stocks to buy today for many more years of outsized returns.\n\nStocks to Buy: Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) ODFL logo on the side of a train\n\nSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first stock to buy if you want to become a millionaire is a surprising pick: trucking company Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL). Unlike traditional point-to-point full-truckload companies, Old Dominion is the second-largest player by revenue in the less-than-truckload (LTL) space behind FedEX (NYSE:FDX). Its Freight division generated $10.1 billion in revenue last year, while ODFL produced almost $6.2 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOld Dominion, however, has been picked as the No. 1 LTL trucking company by the market researchers Mastio for 14 consecutive years. The trucker consistently comes out on top across 28 separate categories, such as on-time delivery, damages, shortages, and service.\n\nLTL companies pick up shipments at terminals, sort and consolidate them based on the destination, and then deliver freight from multiple shippers to multiple destinations.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Old Dominion Freight Lines stock has been an excellent investment. Its total return is 752% versus 239% for the S&P 500. A $10,000 grubstake in ODFL in 2014 would be worth over $85,200 today.\n\nThe LTL industry is not like the tech industry. You won\u2019t get moonshots but steady growth at about 4% annually. You\u2019ll find this overlooked stock a \u201csteady Eddy\u201d that wins the race with fewer bumps along the road.\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage. Focus on cellphone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) is probably more familiar to most investors. The maker of the Taser stun gun has enjoyed even better stock performance over the past decade than Old Dominion. Shares have grown by more than 2,000% over the last 10 years, turning $10,000 into more than $211,000. Last November, I said if you only have $100 to invest, Axon would make an excellent addition to your portfolio. The stock has been up 31% since then. It remains a top pick today.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales at Axon are on the rise because law enforcement agencies demand a less-than-lethal alternative. But even more important to the stun gun maker\u2019s growth has been the sale of body cameras. In an era of accountability where protecting the public and law enforcement officers is equally vital, the use of body cameras has exploded.\n\nWhere Taser sales were up 33% in the first quarter, sensors and software\u2014Axon\u2019s body cam business\u2014were soaring 51% year over year.\n\nDemand is not letting up either, not just in the U.S. but worldwide. In addition to the devices, there are the \u201cconsumables\u201d for the Tasers and the evidence database management system for the cameras. Often purchased on a subscription basis, they create a sticky environment that keeps customers returning for more. As such, I think it is one of the best stocks to buy.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nAnother surprise pick for minting millionaires is Deckers Outdoor (NASDAQ:DECK). Who knew Uggs would have such staying power? They generated $2.2 billion in sales last year, a 16% increase from the year before. Yet as powerful a brand as the footwear remains, Decker\u2019s fastest-growing brand is its Hoka running shoes. They generated $1.8 billion in sales last year, up 28% year-over-year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Hoka sales accelerated their growth spurt, surging 34% and surpassing Ugg with $533 million in sales. Ugg notched $361 million in sales for the period, a 15% increase.\n\nDecker found a new life for Uggs with the extreme popularity of TikTok and influencers wearing the brand. Direct-to-consumer sales now account for 43% of the total, up from less than a third a decade ago.\n\nOver the last 10 years, Decker Outdoor stock generated returns of 1,160% for investors, meaning $10,000 invested in the footwear stock would be worth $126,000 today. Look for the Ugg maker to keep kicking it higher in the coming decade.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Nvidia shares gained 3% before the bell on Thursday, set to extend the semiconductor bellwether's lead as the world's most valuable company, after partners Dell and Super Micro Computer received server orders for Elon Musk's AI startup.\n\nNvidia, whose market capitalization surpassed that of Microsoft on Tuesday, was set to add more than $92 billion to its market value of $3.34 trillion at $139.35, compared with Microsoft's $3.32 trillion.\n\nDell Technologies and Super Micro Computer gained 3.8% and 4.8%, respectively.\n\nThe companies make servers equipped with Nvidia chips, enabling them to capitalize on the surging demand for processors that power virtually all AI applications.\n\nMusk said on his X social media platform on Wednesday that Dell and Super Micro are supplying server racks for xAI's supercomputer, which will be used to expand the capabilities of its AI tool, Grok.\n\nHe said earlier this year that training the Grok 2 model took about 20,000 Nvidia H100 graphic processing units and that the Grok 3 model and beyond would require 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.\n\n\"While Microsoft both spends and makes money in AI, Nvidia only makes money and lot's of money and profits in AI. That's why you cannot spell Nvidia without AI,\" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer, Longbow Asset Management.\n\nNvidia's stock price has nearly tripled so far this year, powering the gains in the broader market. Super Micro shares have more than tripled in value during the same period, while Dell's stock is up nearly 95%.\n\nThe Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index has risen nearly 34% since the most recent low in April and closed at a lifetime high on Tuesday.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Medha Singh; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Rags to Riches: 3 High-Risk Stocks That Could Make Early Investors Rich",
        "content": "A lot of great stocks are hiding in plain sight. Many stocks quietly outperform the market without generating much, if any, media attention. Oftentimes, these high-risk stocks are prone to volatility and big swings in their share price. Investors who have a high risk tolerance and are willing to be patient can earn a good return on these more risky investments.\n\nSometimes it is smaller volatile stocks that end up being multibaggers and lead to shareholders getting rich. Consider energy drink company Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). Twenty years ago, its stock was trading for 34 cents a share. Today, the share price is just under $50. That\u2019s a gain of 14,000%. Two decades ago, most analysts dismissed Monster Beverage as a small company with a niche product and a risky stock. Taking a chance on certain high-risk stocks can pay off over time.\n\nHere is rag to riches: three high-risk stocks that could make early investors rich.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIron Mountain (IRM) Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truck\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) servers, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) tends to get all the attention. But another company capitalizing on the opportunity with AI servers is Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM). The company is structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT) and is mostly focused on data storage, back-up and recovery services, as well as records management.\n\nHowever, Iron Mountain is also pushing into the AI server sector. Through an initiative called \u201cProject Matterhorn\u201d that was launched in 2022, the company is investing heavily in the development of data centers and servers to meet the AI needs of other companies. To that end, Iron Mountain has leased 124 megawatts of data center capacity. As for IRM stock, it has risen 60% in the last year, including a 29% gain so far in 2024.\n\nIron Mountain stock is not without risks. It\u2019s currently at a 52-week high and has an exorbitant valuation, trading at 135 times future earnings estimates. Company insiders have also been offloading the stock lately. It does pay a generous quarterly dividend of 65 cents per share, giving it a yield of nearly 3%.\n\nHawkins (HWKN) Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipes\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHawkins (NASDAQ:HWKN) is a relatively small company based outside Minneapolis that specializes in chemicals. Its diversified chemical products are used for everything from ensuring clean drinking water and adding flavor to food to developing health supplements and pharmaceutical medications. The company has been in business since 1938 and today has operations in 27 states and nearly 1,000 employees.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, Hawkins remains a small company with less than $1 billion in annual revenues and a market capitalization below $2 billion. Still, the essential nature of its products has led HWKN stock to outperform the broader market. The company\u2019s share price has risen 350% over the last five years, is up 82% in the past 12 months, and has gained nearly 30% so far in 2024. The company also pays a quarterly dividend of 16 cents per share, which it regularly increases. This is the type of small-cap stock that might be worth the risk.\n\nCelsius (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background. High-Risk Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA buying opportunity might have opened up in Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH). The energy drink company\u2019s stock has plunged 34% over the past month and is trading nearly 40% below its 52-week high. The decline in CELH stock is due to concerns that the company\u2019s rapid growth is beginning to slow. Sales figures show that Celsius\u2019 energy drinks that are made from natural ingredients such as green tea and ginger have cooled.\n\nAnalysts are calling the steep drop in CELH stock during the last month an overreaction and overdone. Piper Sandler just reiterated a $90 price target and \u201cbuy\u201d rating on CELH stock. The $90 price target implies 43% upside for Celsius\u2019 shares. While sales of the energy drinks have slowed, analysts point out that they\u2019re still growing at a 40% year-over-year clip, which is very strong.\n\nDespite the recent volatility, CELH stock remains one of the best performers of the past five years, having gained 4,805% since 2019.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Completed Its 10-for-1 Stock Split. These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Could Be the Next Stock Splits",
        "content": "Stocks that split tend to beat the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), according to research from Bank of America. Since 1980, the average company has seen its share price increase 25.4% during the 12 months following a stock split announcement, while the S&P 500 has returned an average of 11.9% during the same period.\n\nNvidia is the most recent company to follow that pattern. Since announcing a 10-for-1 stock split on May 22, its share price has surged 43%, while the S&P 500 has returned just 3%. Nvidia's success is due to its market leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) chips and its expanding influence in other areas of the AI economy.\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) also play important roles in the AI economy, and they could be the next companies to announce stock splits. Here's what investors should know.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs and manufactures high-performance computing platforms for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its products include individual servers and full-rack solutions purpose-built for AI applications. Supermicro has a deep relationship with Nvidia, but it also sources chips, memory, and other hardware from suppliers like Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, and Intel.\n\nDell Technologies leads the server market in sales, but Supermicro is an early frontrunner in the AI server subcategory due to its unique building-block approach to product development. Specifically, the company can quickly integrate the latest chips and hardware into preassembled server building blocks, and it handles most development in-house. The upshot is that Supermicro can usually bring new technologies to market more quickly than its rivals.\n\nSupermicro also affords customers more flexibility in creating customized computing platforms. Its building blocks can be assembled in countless combinations, such that it has one of the broadest and deepest portfolios of advanced server and storage solutions in the IT industry. CEO Charles Liang says Supermicro offers the \"best and broadest application-optimized GPU solutions on the market.\"\n\nCollectively, those advantages -- the ability to launch new products quickly and satisfy a broad range of customer requests -- should keep Supermicro at the forefront of the AI server market. Indeed, Bank of America analysts estimate its market share at 17% by 2026, up from 10% in 2023. Even more bullish, KeyBank analysts expect Supermicro to account for 23% of AI server sales by 2025.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 48% annually through fiscal 2026,\u00a0which ends June 30, 2026. That estimate makes the current valuation of 51.6 times earnings look reasonable despite being a hefty premium to the three-year average of 21.9 times earnings. I would feel comfortable buying a small position in this AI stock today, whether or not the company splits its stock in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft is the largest enterprise software company in the world. It accounted for 18% of software sales last year, and its market share could reach 20% by 2025, according to Morgan Stanley. Microsoft's flagship office productivity platform, Microsoft 365, is the foundation of that success. But the company is also the market leader in enterprise resource planning software with its Dynamics suite.\n\nMicrosoft is leaning on those advantages to monetize generative AI. It has added conversational assistants that complement its enterprise software. For instance, Copilot for Microsoft 365 automates tasks across Word, Excel, and other productivity applications. Similarly, Copilot for Dynamics 365 automates tasks across sales, service, and finance applications. Nearly 60% of Fortune 500 companies use a Copilot product.\n\nMicrosoft's IT prowess extends beyond enterprise software. Its Azure subsidiary accounted for 25% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending in the first quarter, second only to Amazon Web Services (AWS). But Azure gained two points of market share over the past year, while AWS lost a percentage point of market share.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss discussed those share gains in a recent note to clients. \"The company's leadership in the shift to the public cloud is now being compounded by an early leadership positioning in generative AI.\" One reason for that momentum is the partnership with OpenAI, a start-up best known for ChatGPT. Azure OpenAI Service lets Microsoft customers build generative AI applications with OpenAI large language models.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Microsoft to grow earnings per share at 14.7%\u00a0annually through fiscal 2027, which ends June 30, 2027. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 38.7 times earnings look expensive. Personally, I think Microsoft shares have gotten slightly ahead of themselves amid the AI-induced euphoria currently percolating the market. I would wait for a cheaper valuation before buying this potential stock-split stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Companies Seriously Due for a Stock Split in 2024",
        "content": "Every time a company splits its stock, one of the reasons it gives is that it makes its stock more accessible to smaller investors. Never mind that the advent of fractional shares enables these smaller investors to own a specific amount as low as a dollar for stock split candidates.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced May 22 that it was splitting its stock on a 10-for-1 basis. In the two weeks before the shares actually split on June 7, they jumped 27%. They gained another 9% in the week after.\n\nSo, even if the shares were $2,000 before the gains pre-split, they still could have been had on June 8 for $254 [$2,000 x 1.27/10].\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), another AI dynamo, is splitting its shares 10-for-1 on July 15. Since it announced its stock split \u2013 at the same time as Q2 2024 earnings \u2013 AVGO stock is up 22% with a month to go before the split takes effect.\n\nUltimately, the most common reason for stock splits is to increase common share liquidity.\n\nHere are three likely stock split candidates in 2024.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T.

Its shares are up almost 310% in the last year. Up until March 2023, SMCI stock never traded over $100, so there was never a need.\n\nSuper Micro Computer high-performance server and storage solutions address computational-intensive workloads, as it states on its 2023 10-K.\n\n\u201cWe offer a broad range of accelerated compute platforms that are application-optimized server solutions, rackmount and blade servers, storage, and subsystems and accessories, which can be used to build complete server and storage systems.\n\n\u201cThese Total IT Solutions and products are designed to serve a variety of markets, such as enterprise data centers, cloud computing, AI and 5G/edge computing.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, I haven\u2019t spent much time following SMCI, but it\u2019s growing like hotcakes. In Q3 2024, its revenues jumped 200% to $3.85 billion. In 2024, it expects $14.7 billion in revenue, more than double a year earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, it expects to earn $23.69 a share at the midpoint of its guidance.\n\nBased on this guidance, it trades at 38.5x its expected 2024 earnings. Assuming revenues keep growing triple digits, a 10-for-1 stock split like Nvidia or Broadcom is in order.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) COIN stock Coinbase logo on screen with Bitcoin coins\n\nSource: 24K-Production / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) operates one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. As its investor relations site states, the quarterly volume traded on its platform is approximately $312 billion. It protects over $330 billion in cryptocurrency assets from over 100 countries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThanks to the rebound in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other cryptocurrencies over the past year, its shares are up more than 57% year-t0-date and 333% over the past year. Trading around $247, I doubt a 10-for-1 stock split would be in the cards, but a 5-for-1 would seem to make sense.\n\nBesides Bitcoin, Coinbase would be the next-best proxy for the cryptocurrency industry. If the industry does well, Coinbase will, too.\n\nIn late May, Coinbase was upgraded from \u201cunderperform\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d by BofA Securities. More importantly, it raised its target price by nearly double to $217 from $110. It believes that the company\u2019s expense controls have kept a lid on expenses, and profitability.\n\nBofA isn\u2019t the only Wall Street firm less than sold on the company. Of the 29 covering COIN stock, only 12 rate it a \u201cbuy,\u201d with four calling it a \u201csell.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s a stock that could use a stock split, Coinbase would be it.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), the company and stock, are both ablaze.\n\nThe retailer, whose brands include Abercrombie, Abercrombie Kids, Hollister, and Gilly Hicks, reported its best Q1 in the history of the company on May 29. Shares jumped 24% on the news. They\u2019re now up 107% in 2024 and 419% over the past year.\n\nIts earnings were $2.14 a share, 40 cents higher than the analyst estimate, while revenues were $1.02 billion, $57 million higher than the Wall Street consensus. The quarter\u2019s biggest achievement was 7x revenue growth last year.\n\nInterestingly, of the two brands, Abercrombie\u2019s growth is much more impressive, up 31% year-over-year, compared to 12% for Hollister. Anytime you can grow revenues by double digits you\u2019re doing alright.\n\nAbercrombie\u2019s two-year same-store sales stack is 24% (Q1 2024 and 2025). In Q1 2022, sales were so bad, it didn\u2019t provide those numbers. That\u2019s how far it\u2019s come.\n\nIn 2023, its shares gained over 200%. Last December, I recommended that investors buy its shares. I continue to feel it\u2019s one of the few shining stars in apparel retail.\n\nTrading around $188, a 3-for-1 stock split seems about right.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "Amid the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom, shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have set the stock market on fire in 2024, racking up gains of 166% and 197%, respectively, as of this writing. Thanks to the booming demand for the AI-enabling hardware they sell, they have experienced stunning accelerations in their revenue and earnings growth.\n\nNvidia's dominance in the AI chip market has translated into phenomenal growth, and Super Micro Computer isn't far behind. Data center operators are flocking to its modular server solutions to mount the AI chips that Nvidia and other companies sell. However, if you are looking to add an AI stock to your portfolio and want to choose between one of these two, which one should you be buying right now?\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia reportedly controlled a whopping 94% of the AI chip market at the end of 2023. The company's results for the first quarter of its fiscal 2025 (which ended on April 28) suggest that its dominance has it on course for another year of terrific growth.\n\nRevenue rose a stunning 262% year over year to $26 billion. Its impressive pricing power led to a 461% surge in adjusted earnings to $6.12 per share. Management's revenue guidance of $28 billion for the current quarter suggests that its top line is on track to jump 107% year over year, which would be an acceleration from the 101% growth it delivered in the same period last year.\n\nHowever, emerging growth avenues in the nascent AI market indicate that Nvidia could end up doing even better than that. For instance, governments across the globe are reportedly pouring huge amounts of money into AI infrastructure, and sovereign investments in AI technology are expected to contribute $10 billion to Nvidia's top line this fiscal year, as compared to nothing in the previous one.\n\nMore specifically, governments are looking to make large language models (LLMs) in local languages based on country-specific data. On Nvidia's May conference call, management pointed out that Japan, France, Italy, and Singapore are already investing in AI infrastructure. It expects more countries to join the bandwagon. \"The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation,\" said CFO Colette Kress.\n\nSaudi Arabia, for instance, is reportedly looking to invest $40 billion in AI initiatives, while China's AI-focused spending is forecast to exceed $38 billion by 2027. Meanwhile, key Indian companies such as Tata Group and Reliance Industries are relying on Nvidia's chips to train LLMs.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, Nvidia's customer base is diversifying beyond the major cloud infrastructure providers that have been deploying its chips in large numbers to train and deploy AI models. Spending on AI chips is expected to grow more than 10-fold over the next decade, generating $341 billion in revenue in 2033 compared to $23 billion last year. The stage seems set for Nvidia to maintain its tremendous growth as it takes solid steps to ensure that it remains the dominant player in this space.\n\nThat's why analysts forecast that the company's top line will keep growing at a healthy pace from fiscal 2024's reading of nearly $61 billion. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSo, Nvidia should remain a top AI stock as the race to develop AI applications by companies and governments alike has created a secular growth opportunity.\n\nThe case for Super Micro Computer\n\nSupermicro's growth is entwined to some extent with that of Nvidia. Data center operators require server rack solutions of the type that Supermicro sells to mount the processors sold by Nvidia and other chipmakers. So, it is not surprising that demand for Supermicro's servers has simply taken off.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended March 31, its revenue jumped 200% year over year. Non-GAAP net income per share, meanwhile, jumped by a whopping 307%. So, Supermicro isn't all that far behind Nvidia when it comes to how AI has supercharged its fortunes. The company is guiding for revenue of $14.9 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends this month. This would be a big jump over the $7.1 billion in revenue it reported in its fiscal 2023.\n\nMore importantly, analysts are expecting its top line to nearly double over the next couple of fiscal years. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe good part is that Supermicro can sustain a healthy pace of growth beyond the next couple of fiscal years. That's because the demand for AI servers is expected to expand at a compound annual rate of 25% through 2029. The market is expected to generate annual revenue of almost $73 billion after five years, up from $17.5 billion in 2022.\n\nSupermicro is growing at a faster pace than the AI server market right now. As it turns out, its growth is faster than that of more established companies such as Dell Technologies, which has sold $3 billion worth of AI servers in the past three quarters. Supermicro generated $9.6 billion in revenue in the past three quarters and gets more than half its revenue from selling AI-related server solutions.\n\nSupermicro has been able to make a dent in the AI server market despite the presence of bigger players. Also, with the moves that the company has been making to increase its production-utilization rate and its manufacturing capacity, it could corner a bigger share of the AI server market in the future.\n\nLike Nvidia, even Supermicro looks like a solid long-term AI play. But is it worth buying over Nvidia?\n\nThe verdict\n\nBoth Nvidia and Supermicro are high-growth companies benefiting big time from the proliferation of AI. So investors' choice about which stock they may want to buy right now is going to boil down to the valuation. Supermicro is substantially cheaper than Nvidia as far as their earnings and sales multiples are concerned. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nHowever, in terms of the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, the story is a bit more interesting. That metric is a forward-looking valuation determined by dividing a company's trailing earnings multiple by the earnings growth that it is expected to deliver over a future period. Any (positive) PEG ratio below 1 is viewed by most investors as indicating a bargain stock. And on that metric, both Nvidia and Supermicro are undervalued. SMCI PEG Ratio Chart\n\nSo by at least one forward-looking measure, both Nvidia and Supermicro are attractive buys right now for anyone looking to add a growth stock to their portfolios. More importantly, both these companies seem capable of delivering the outstanding growth that the market expects from them, thanks to the lucrative opportunities they are sitting on. And that's why investors can consider buying either stock, despite the terrific gains they have clocked so far this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are the most popular and compelling chip stocks to buy. Although Nvidia dominates the AI chip space, AMD is a clear challenger to the company for dominance. That one-two positioning for AI preeminence has positioned the two stocks as leading investments.\n\nWith AI expected to continue booming, investors want to know where the next compelling chip stock opportunities are.\n\nFear not if you own both Nvidia and AMD. There are many good chip shares to invest in today. Although I don\u2019t discuss it in this article, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is an excellent example. It\u2019s up nearly 70% in 2024 and is likely to charge higher prices to Nvidia and other leading firms that it supplies with chips.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has soared in 2024, rising by more than 53%. I like Qualcomm for its dividend, which helps smooth out the lows, but the company\u2019s opportunity is about AI.\n\nQualcomm provides AI chips with strong end markets in the smartphone vertical and automotive sectors. The ongoing opportunity in the smartphone and automotive spaces is one of the strongest reasons to believe that Qualcomm can continue to rise higher.\n\nMizuho recently raised its target price for Qualcomm to $240, citing the utility of Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chips in AI-enabled handsets.\n\nThe markets continue to appreciate Qualcomm for its strength in the automotive sector. Revenues from the automotive sector grew by 35% during the most recent quarter. Based on Qualcomm\u2019s growth during the period, it\u2019s very fair to say that the company is taking advantage of the $45 billion design win pipeline.\n\nQualcomm stock likely will grow further in June.\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is an excellent stock to invest in for those seeking exposure to the automotive sector chip opportunity.\n\nSales from within the automotive segment comprised more than $1.8 billion of the company\u2019s nearly $3.13 billion quarterly revenues in Q1. Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile are the company\u2019s next biggest revenue producers. However, those two segments combined produce roughly half the automotive segment\u2019s sales. The point is that NXP Semiconductors is well positioned to grow on the presumed resurgence of the automotive industry, particularly electric vehicles.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to suggest that NXP Semiconductors is currently suffering; it isn\u2019t. Shares are up more than 21% this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the other important pieces of information about NXP Semiconductors is that the company is responsible. In the first quarter, the company lowered its overall debt by nearly $1 billion.\n\nThat fundamental improvement and the automotive opportunity make NXP Semiconductors a strong choice for those already owning Nvidia and AMD.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is essentially a chip stock, although the company does not primarily produce or sell semiconductors. Instead, it makes high-performance rack servers and storage solutions. Super Micro Computers\u2019 sales are booming because they serve the thriving data center sector, which is, in turn, consuming massive quantities of chips. Therefore, I\u2019ve chosen to include it as a chip stock.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a compelling choice for investors who already own Nvidia and AMD. Investors simply need to look at the company\u2019s forecasts to understand why. Revenues and per share earnings are both expected to more than double in 2024, and that opportunity is expected to continue into 2025 and beyond.\n\nSuper Micro Computer supplies enterprises that require high-powered rack solutions that integrate leading chips. It remains one of the better data center stocks to consider. The shares themselves continue to have a very strong upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Jumped Again Today",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock posted big gains again in Tuesday's trading. The server specialist's share price closed out the daily session up 3.7%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nWhile there wasn't any business-specific news pushing the stock higher today, the tech company's valuation advanced thanks to an analyst's belief that artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to power strong demand for servers. In particular, Super Micro stock appears to have gained ground thanks to bullish coverage on Dell stock published by Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring. Super Micro stock is now up roughly 224% across 2024's trading.\n\nSuper Micro climbs on surging AI server demand\n\nCiting strong demand for servers capable of powering AI services, Morgan Stanley's Erik Woodring published a bullish research note on Dell stock yesterday. The incredible rise in demand for high-performance rack servers has helped to power incredible sales and earnings growth for both Dell and Super Micro over the last year. In turn, both companies' share prices have skyrocketed.\n\nThanks in large part to the positive coverage from Morgan Stanley's lead analyst on the stock, Dell's share price posted 5% gains in Tuesday's trading, and Super Micro's share price saw gains in tandem with the advance. Even though Dell and Super Micro have a somewhat competitive dynamic in the server space, promising demand indicators are a bullish indicator for both companies.\n\nWhat comes next for Super Micro stock?\n\nIt seems clear that the AI revolution is just starting to unfold. Super Micro is positioned as a leading provider of one-stop-shop, high-performance rack servers capable of powering advanced AI applications. But the rapidly evolving nature of AI means that investors have to keep developing risk factors in mind before going all in on any hot stock in the space.\n\nWhile bullish coverage on Dell helped power significant gains for Super Micro stock today, investors should keep emerging competitive dynamics in mind. In particular, some analysts think that Nvidia could move to design its own server racks to correspond with the launch of its GB200 AI chip. If that winds up being the case, it could curtail growth opportunities for Super Micro and other players in the specialized server space.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Sell in June Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "U.S. equities continue their rally, defying all odds. The S&P 500 has climbed 13.9% since the start of the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared 17.3%. Well-known artificial intelligence (AI) behemoths, particularly Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), are responsible for much of the gains. Moreover, last week turned out to be great from a macroeconomic perspective. The May consumer price index (CPI) report came in lower than most economists had forecasted, and wholesale prices, which are measured via the producer price index (PPI), experienced an unexpected drop as well.\n\nFalling consumer prices will increase the possibility of rate cut later in the year, which is what the market has been hoping for. Tech stocks, especially those with an exposure to AI, will benefit significantly from this. However, not all AI stocks are poised to bring about good fortunes. Below are three to sell before they crash and burn.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) runs a full-service AI platform for a variety of enterprises. The software firm\u2019s AI platform empowers developers to create and deploy. Furthermore, C3 offers several turnkey applications, including C3 AI Ex Machina for analysis-ready data, C3 AI CRM, an industry specific customer relationship management solution, and C3 Generative AI Product Suite, a tool that helps to retrieve and present data.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough C3.ai has made some major commitments to the novel space, its financial figures leave a lot to be desired. Nvidia and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) are deeply connected to the rise of AI technologies and both companies have begun to see their revenues figures double over recent earnings period. C3.ai, even though the firm has had some successes with its suite of AI products, has reported revenue growth figures that have blown the minds of any investors. For their fiscal year 2025, the enterprise AI software company expects to grow revenue by only 23% on a year-over-year basis. While revenue growth remains in the low double digits, it will be a while before C3.ai generates real free cash flow and net income.\n\nC3.ai\u2019s share price is trading relatively flat at this point in the year.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity is another vertical of enterprise software that would benefit from the deployment of AI. Digital transformation, especially migration to the cloud, has created numerous synergies in modern businesses, but one unintended adverse effect has been the proliferation of cybersecurity attacks. SentinelOne (NYSE:S) came to the already competitive market with an artificial intelligence solution. In particular, Singularity Platform deployed AI models to make defense against cybers attacks fully autonomous.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom 2020 to the end of 2022, SentinelOne\u2019s platform really gained traction, doubling revenue from year to year. Unfortunately, a troubled macroeconomic environment put a stop to that, and the company\u2019s year-over-year growth rates have, in turn, plummeted.\n\nRising competition from larger players like CrowdStrike, which has begun to deploy its own AI-enabled endpoint security solutions, looms in the background as well. S shares have dropped 32% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SoundHound Inc.'s (SOUN) Headquarters exterior. The company develops voice-recognition, natural language understanding, sound-recognition and search technologies.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:AI) is an Nvidia-backed artificial intelligence startup that develops AI voice solutions for enterprises. The rise of generative AI has placed the company back into the spotlight, and when investors found out that Nvidia had been one of the startup\u2019s backers, its share price began to soar. SOUN rallied as much as 320% in the middle of March, highlighting the high rewards possible in the era of market craze over AI.\n\nInvestors are finally coming back to their senses and have tried to ascertain whether the SoundHound\u2019s AI solutions are just hype. A short seller report from Capybara Research, in essence, stated just that. \u201cThe Houndify product uses\u00a0commodity speech recognition\u00a0to search a manually programmed knowledge graph,\u201d the report asserted. In other words, the SoundHound product likely isn\u2019t anything very special, which could make it easier for competitors to thwart its growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold for 20X Gains by 2033",
        "content": "Growth stocks are rallying higher and higher in the current environment, and it makes sense so many people are getting in on the action. A side effect of this is that many people are also starting to turn to many speculative bets, and we can see that through the recent meme stocks and crypto rallies.\n\nIt\u2019s a far better idea to widen your timeframe instead of dabbling in memecoins or meme stocks or trying to catch a falling knife. Of course, I love to write about them, but these assets should only form a small portion of your portfolio. Investing in quality companies with solid prospects in the coming decades is a much better idea. It is much more likely that these growth stocks will deliver multibagger returns by 2033, and some may even 20x if the stars align for them.\n\nHere are seven such growth stocks to buy and hold.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) makes unmanned aircraft systems, tactical missile systems and high-altitude pseudo-satellites. This defense tech leader is poised for explosive growth in the coming years, driven by the unstoppable megatrend of drone adoption in warfare and policing worldwide.\n\nGovernments are racing to catch up on this critical technology, and AVAV\u2019s 71% surge over the past six months reflects the immense pent-up demand finally being unleashed. Growth Stocks: AVAV financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIn Q3, AVAV\u2019s revenue soared 39% year-over-year to a record $187 million, with its Loitering Munition segment more than doubling.\n\nManagement\u2019s confidence in raising full-year guidance speaks volumes about the momentum they see in orders. As one of the premier providers of cutting-edge drone solutions, I expect AVAV to continue delivering estimate-beating growth as it captures an outsized share of ballooning defense budgets. The backlog is also swelling already. AVAV backlog\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWhile a 20x gain from here is undoubtedly ambitious, I wouldn\u2019t rule it out over the long run. The mass production of inexpensive yet highly effective drones is still in its infancy in the West.\n\nDroneShield (DRSHF) Image of a drone delivering a package\n\nSource: Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is another drone pick and the last one, I promise! DroneShield (OTCMKTS:DRSHF) provides cutting-edge drone defense solutions to counter the rapidly growing threat of drones. With geopolitical tensions escalating and drone usage surging, the demand for effective counter-drone systems is skyrocketing. DroneShield is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this megatrend, as evidenced by its stellar Q1 2024 results. Revenues soared 10x YOY to 16.4 million AUD, while the company now boasts a 519 million AUD sales pipeline.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly exciting is DroneShield\u2019s AI-powered SaaS offerings, which saw revenues double in Q1. As drones become more advanced, customers will need DroneShield\u2019s continuously evolving AI software to stay ahead of the threat. With over 95 engineers and a 400 million AUD annual production capacity, DroneShield is ready to meet the explosive demand ahead.\n\nThe stock has surged 464% in the past year, but this is just the beginning. As more militaries and critical infrastructure operators wake up to the urgent need for drone defense, DroneShield\u2019s growth trajectory could turn parabolic. Don\u2019t be surprised to see this stock deliver 20x gains by 2033.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications. World wide web on phone via wireless satellite network technology. Smartphone digital connection at clouds services of all earth. Holographic abstract interface. ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nImagine if you could invest in Starlink and it was public. Well, this pick may fit. AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) is building the first space-based cellular broadband network that will allow everyday mobile phones to connect directly to satellites. This disruptive technology could be a game-changer in the telecom industry, riding the unstoppable 5G and smartphone megatrends to deliver 20X or greater returns by 2033 potentially.\n\nWhile traditional telecom stocks often have slow growth, high debt and lackluster returns, ASTS is a unique pure-play on the satellite-to-smartphone revolution. The company\u2019s innovative approach means you won\u2019t need a special satellite phone or antenna to access 5G broadband from space \u2014 just an unmodified 5G-compatible phone in your pocket.\n\nWith the stock already up 123% in the past month, we\u2019re just scratching the surface of ASTS\u2019 explosive growth potential. The company signed its first definitive commercial agreement with AT&T (NYSE:T) through 2030 and expects to replicate this revenue-share model globally. ASTS revenue estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnalysts see ASTS reaching profitability by 2027, with annual revenue skyrocketing to $35 billion by 2032. If ASTS can execute on its first-mover advantage, we could be looking at the next Starlink.\n\nCreative Realities (CREX) Explore the stock market trends for 2024 with analytical visuals of businessman planning long term investments and future business growth, Navigate towards success with smart strategies. growth stocks with millionaire potential\n\nSource: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nCreative Realities (NASDAQ:CREX) provides digital signage solutions. The company reported record Q1 revenue of $12.3 million, up an impressive 23.5% year over year. CREX stock, which has already surged nearly 110% year over year, still has tremendous upside potential.\n\nThe digital signage market is projected to reach $46 billion by 2030. Creative Realities is well-positioned to capitalize on this megatrend. The company already expects a $20 million ARR by year-end.\n\nGross margins remain healthy and should expand as high-margin subscription revenue grows. The upcoming $20 million credit facility also gives Creative Realities ample dry powder for strategic investments.\n\nCREX looks significantly undervalued relative to its growth prospects. Analysts expect the company to turn profitable with 28% revenue growth this year. If management executes, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the stock deliver 20x returns by 2033.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings logo with silhouette of man using smartphone. is an American daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting company. DKNG stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is a leading digital sports entertainment and gaming company. DraftKings is poised to ride the megatrend of online sports betting and gambling legalization sweeping across the United States. In the latest quarter, DraftKings\u2019 revenue grew by an impressive 53% year over year to $1.17 billion, beating estimates by over $51 million.\n\nManagement also raised full-year 2024 revenue guidance, now expecting 34% growth. DraftKings recently launched successfully in Vermont and North Carolina, acquiring customers efficiently. Both states are expected to adjust EBITDA positively in the second half.\n\nThe company sees excellent customer retention and cross-selling across sports and gaming verticals. With more states likely to legalize online gambling in the coming years, I believe DraftKings has a long growth runway ahead. It also has lots of room to expand internationally.

Of course, many things must go right for a 20x return, so keep expectations tempered.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ).

This fintech powerhouse is poised for explosive growth over the next decade, potentially delivering 20X gains by 2033. The fintech sector has been beaten down recently, but Block\u2019s strong Q1 results highlight its resilience and immense upside potential. With EPS of $0.86, beating estimates by $$0.12, and revenue surging 19.38% to $5.96 billion, Block is firing on all cylinders.\n\nThe company was once considered an unprofitable PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) alternative. However, Block has turned the corner to consistent profitability while maintaining robust growth.

(SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) makes servers and storage solutions for data centers and cloud service providers. The company is riding the coattails of the AI and data center megatrend, which has plenty of runway ahead. Even though SMCI stock has skyrocketed nearly 300% over the past year, it\u2019s recently taken a 25% haircut from its highs.\n\nHowever, this pullback presents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors. The AI boom is still in its early innings, and as companies continue to scale their hardware to meet surging demand, Super Micro is perfectly positioned to capitalize.\n\nThe stock trades at a hefty premium, but it\u2019s hard to argue with the blistering 200% revenue growth posted in Q3. As AI adoption accelerates, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see more earnings surprises in the coming quarters.\n\nWhile SMCI\u2019s current $50 billion market cap might seem lofty, if the stars align, it has the potential to grow 20-fold and reach $1 trillion by 2033. Given the AI megatrend, this is a bold prediction but not unreasonable.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Russell 2000 Stocks to Sell in June Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Large capitalization stocks have been getting all the attention in 2024. The S&P 500 Index is up 14% year-to-date (YTD), and the Nasdaq 100 has rallied 17%. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies is actually down fractionally YTD.\n\nGood reasons exist for this discrepancy. The major indexes are full of fast-growing tech companies that are enjoying record profits right now. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 Index is full of companies in less glamorous industries such as regional banking, utilities and healthcare which have missed out on much of the market\u2019s recent enthusiasm.\n\nDespite that, some serious pitfalls can still be found within the Russell 2000. While the index may seem cheap overall, these three Russell 2000 stocks to sell are absolute minefields set to blow up on unsuspecting investors later this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is now the quintessential example of an overvalued Russell 2000 company to sell before it crashes.\n\nSMCI stock is now the largest holding in the Russell 2000 Index, making up 1.5% of the entire space as of this writing. That\u2019s incredible, as most holdings are just 0.1% or 0.2% of the index, which is fitting for such a broadly diversified portfolio of companies. In fact, only one other company, Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), makes up more than 0.5% of the Russell 2000 Index today.\n\nHow did SMCI stock grow to be such an outlier? Its price is up almost 250% over the past year and more than 4,000% over the past five years.\n\nInvestors have become fascinated with the high-performance server and storage solutions\u00a0company due to its products which go into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Super Micro Computer doubled revenues between 2019 and 2023. Further, analysts expect another doubling in 2024 before growth rapidly slows down thereafter.\n\nSMCI has certainly enjoyed stellar top-line growth recently. However, it is still selling a commodity product with low profit margins. In fact, the company\u2019s gross profit margin was merely 18% in 2023, up only slightly from the 15.2% profit margin it earned over the past decade on average.\n\nBy contrast, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a gross margin above 60%, and most software companies tend to run 70% or higher. A tech commodity hardware product from Super Micro Computer can make money for a time. But once the boom ends, profits tend to crash. SMCI stock is riding the AI wave. Yet the moment the tide starts to turn, Super Micro Computer shares will crash against the rocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location with doors open)\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the oddest phenomena in the small cap space has been the rebound in mall retail stocks. Both Dillard\u2019s (NYSE:DDS) and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) have seen their shares rise tenfold from their pandemic lows. ANF has been particularly shocking, with shares rising more than 400% over the past year alone. This seems to be putting the cart ahead of the horse, as mall traffic is still slightly below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe company has enjoyed a sharp upturn in earnings over the past two years. Consumers have been shopping at a healthy rate since the economy reopened, as folks are prioritizing experiences in a form of what\u2019s known as revenge spending.\n\nThis has benefitted retail companies, like Abercrombie & Fitch, that have been able to play the consumer trends well. There\u2019s no taking anything away from the success that management has had over the past 18 months.\n\nNevertheless, Abercrombie & Fitch generated $4.3 billion in revenues in fiscal year 2024. That was up only slightly from the $3.7 billion that the company produced way back in 2015. At the same time, ANF stock was trading around $25 back then and now it\u2019s at $185.\n\nNeedless to say, this sort of wild expansion in a company\u2019s price-to-sales ratio is hard to maintain. Investors are placing way too high a multiple on near-term elevated profits tied to an unusual burst of consumer spending. When the next recession inevitably hits, ANF stock will end up back on the clearance rack.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast fall, I highlighted AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) as a defense stock set to explode higher. That worked out well, with AVAV stock doubling since then.\n\nAeroVironment was the perfect stock for the moment. That\u2019s because it produces a variety of drone units that don\u2019t require any human pilots. This allows militaries to engage with enemy combatants from long distances without risking their own personnel.\n\nAlready, AeroVironment had developed a considerable business, and then the war in Ukraine threw this into overdrive. Ukranian allies have rushed to buy drones in a way to support the war cause without directly sending their own soldiers into battle.\n\nThis has worked wonders for AeroVironment\u2019s earnings, with EPS set to double in fiscal year 2024 on a roughly 31% increase in revenues.\n\nHowever, the issue is the sustainability of this increase. Analysts see earnings and revenue growth greatly decelerating next year. At some point, the war in Ukraine will slow down or there will be a ceasefire altogether.\n\nWith AVAV stock now trading at a stunning 77 times estimated 2024 earnings (and that during a wartime boom, no less) it\u2019s hard to see any possible further upside from here. AeroVironment was a great trade. But it\u2019s now turned into an exceptionally risky one giving the stunning valuation at today\u2019s price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy Following the Nvidia Stock Split",
        "content": "Tech industry darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has taken the market to new highs, and investors who missed out on buying stock ahead of the AI boom have regretted this more than ever. The company\u00a0can potentially\u00a0impact several other tech companies and the stock market as a whole. Nvidia recently announced a 10-for-1 stock split to make it easier for investors to own the stock. Once trading at $1,200, the stock is now available for $131. However, besides the artificial intelligence leader,\u00a0there are several other AI stocks to buy that could\u00a0benefit from the AI boom and the stock split.\n\nThe broader sentiment towards the AI industry is bullish. These companies are already seeing their stocks rally with each quarterly result, and now is the time to load up on them if you want to enjoy more upside. Let\u2019s take a look at the three AI stocks worth buying after Nvidia\u2019s stock split.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Oracle (ORCL) The logo for Oracle Corp (ORCL) is seen on the side of a tall glass building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloud service provider Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the fastest-moving stocks. Up 32% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $138. It is one of the top AI stocks to own amid the Nvidia stock split.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnce popular for database management, Oracle is\u00a0now\u00a0expanding its cloud business and has seen an impressive demand. Its cloud infrastructure revenue hit $2 billion, up 42% year-over-year in the recent quarter and the outstanding performance obligations soared 44% and stood at $98 billion. This shows the company\u2019s strength amid the rising competition.\n\nThe company is attracting customers and has had two exceptional quarters. It is signing new contracts\u00a0rapidly\u00a0and is currently rallying on the deal with OpenAI. The company will run AI workloads on Oracle cloud infrastructure and has another multi-cloud deal with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0as well. These two deals could be a game-changer for the business.\n\nThe stock has already picked momentum and has had an excellent 2024\u00a0. I believe Oracle will end the year on a high note, and\u00a0it\u00a0has a buy rating from\u00a0Wall Street with a price target of $145.\n\nBuying ORCL stock looks like a good deal right now.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is the one stock that soars whenever Nvidia does. If you believe that the AI race\u00a0will\u00a0last longer, load up on SMCI stock. The stock is trading at $844 today, up 195% YTD. It is also down from the 52-week high of $1,229.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company designs and makes high-performance servers\u00a0\u00a0for AI and machine learning devices. Running the latest chips requires the right hardware infrastructure, and Super Micro Computer leads the industry here.\n\nIt ensures that there is everything to achieve the right balance between the software and hardware components. It has seen explosive growth due to the high AI demand and works with Nvidia to build\u00a0GPU\u00a0server systems.\u00a0 The company is expanding its manufacturing capabilities at\u00a0its\u00a0global facilities, including California, Taiwan, and Malaysia.\n\nSuper Micro Computer reported an impressive quarter. Revenue jumped 200% to $3.9 billion, and EPS jumped 308% to $6.65. There is a lot more upside from the current level as companies and governments are investing heavily in AI. Management is aiming for revenue in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion for the quarter.\n\nThe company could also follow Nvidia\u2019s steps and announce a stock split. Nevertheless, SMCI is one of the best AI stocks to buy, whether it goes for a split or not.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is closely associated with Nvidia and benefits whenever Nvidia soars. Due to its partnership with the company, TSM has seen its value rise over the past year. It is up 55% YTD and is exchanging hands for $921. It manufactures chips for Nvidia and has become a huge asset to its business. As the demand for Nvidia chips soars, TSM will continue rallying.\n\nThe company has taken the necessary steps to ensure high client satisfaction\u00a0and has\u00a0improved the nanometer size of the chips, going from seven to two nanometers over the past few years. It is known for innovation, timeliness, and high quality. The company has seen its market cap swell and is on its way to an exceptional year.\n\nIt reported a 30% jump in the monthly revenue for May, and most of its revenue\u00a0comes\u00a0from chips designed using 3nm, 5nm, and 7nm nodes. Sales of these chips are expected to soar throughout 2024, and TSM will manage to beat expectations in the upcoming quarterly results. While the company has suffered due to a dip in the sales of smartphones and personal computers, the sales are expected to rebound this year, which\u00a0could outpace the revenue estimates.\n\nTSMC is also working on expanding its manufacturing capabilities and has recently opened a new plant in Japan.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "5 Technology Stocks Powering S&amp;P 500 ETF This Year",
        "content": "The S&P 500 has been on a bull run this year, touching a series of record highs buoyed by rate cut bets, strong corporate profit growth and the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) craze. The benchmark registered its 30th record close of the year.\r\n\r\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has gained 14.5% so far this year. While many stocks powered the ETF, technology has been the clear leader. Here, we have highlighted five technology stocks that have led the way higher in the ETF so far this year and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold). These are Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology MU, Broadcom AVGO and Western Digital Corporation WDC (read: Here's Why Tech ETFs Will Continue Their Bull Run).\r\n\r\nThe solid trend is likely to continue in the months ahead as the tech-fueled rally has made Wall Street analysts even more bullish. An analyst at Goldman boosted the year-end target price to 5,600 from 5,200 for the S&P 500 Index for the third time, citing an optimistic outlook for earnings growth and the U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Evercore ISI, one of the prominent bear analysts, turned bullish and expects the stock market to surge another 10% by the end of the year. It raised its year-end S&P 500 price target from 4,750 to 6,000 \u2014 a new high on Wall Street. The analyst stated that the \"AI revolution is in the early innings,\" and that should lead to continued strength in earnings growth. Evercore ISI forecasts S&P 500 EPS growth of 8% and 5% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\r\n\r\nInflation in the United States cooled down in May for the second consecutive month. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.3% year over year in May, down from an annual growth of 3.4% in April. On a monthly basis, prices were flat for the first time since July 2022. Easing inflation indicates that the economy is stabilizing, and interest rates may be declining (read: 5 ETF Zones to Benefit as Inflation Cools in May).\r\n\r\nIn the latest FOMC meeting, U.S. policymakers penciled in just one rate cut for this year. They expect four cuts in 2025. The Fed altered language in its statement, noting there has been \u201cmodest further progress toward the committee\u2019s 2% inflation objective.\u201d Previously, the statement pointed to a \u201clack\u201d of further progress. Low rates reduce the cost of borrowing, often needed to finance the expansion of companies, thereby driving growth in the economy. It typically reduces the attractiveness of fixed-income investments like bonds, leading investors to seek higher returns in the equity markets.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the \"Magnificent Seven\" is the biggest engine of growth for the S&P 500 as a whole, accounting for 31% of the weightage in the index.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.\n\nStory continues\n\nSPY in Focus\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.2% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors, with information technology, financials, and healthcare accounting for a double-digit allocation each.\r\n\r\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has an AUM of $535 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. It trades in an average daily volume of 50 million shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).\r\n\r\nBelow, we have highlighted the abovementioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.\n\nBest-Performing Tech Stocks in SPY\n\nSuper Micro designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture. The stock has skyrocketed 212% this year and accounts for a 0.09% share in the SPY portfolio.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro has an estimated earnings growth rate of 44.6% for the fiscal year (ending June 2025) and a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing units. The stock has jumped 164.5% this year. It has an estimated growth of 106.1% for the fiscal year (ending January 2025).\r\n\r\nNVIDIA makes up 7.1% of the assets in SPY and currently has a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nMicron Technology has established itself as one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions. The stock makes up for 0.3% of the assets in the SPY portfolio.\r\n\r\nMicron Technology has gained 73.2% and has an expected earnings growth rate of 119.1% for the fiscal year (ending August 2024). It has a Zacks Rank #2.\r\n\r\nBroadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V-based products. The stock has soared about 64% this year and accounts for a 1.7% share in the SPY portfolio (read: Broadcom Jumps on Q2 Earnings Beat: ETFs to Buy).\r\n\r\nBroadcom has an estimated earnings growth rate of 11.6% for the fiscal year (ending October 2024) and a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nWestern Digital is a leading developer and manufacturer of data storage devices and solutions based on NAND flash and hard disk drive technologies. The stock has gained 52.5% this year and accounts for a 0.05% share in the SPY portfolio.\r\n\r\nWestern Digital has an estimated earnings growth rate of more than 1000% for the fiscal year (ending June 2025) and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "An unfortunate aspect of the stock market is that certain companies can rapidly gain value as a result of bullish echo chambers. This can lead to a level of hype that sometimes obscures the real value or financial situation of a company. Thus, the result is some overvalued stocks to sell. While there are both objective and subjective ways to value a company, its share price can often come down to something as simple as investor interest or faith.\n\nHowever, investors interested in long-term returns need to avoid stocks that gain their value from conversations. Rather, investors should focus carefully on balance sheets, earnings reports and the metrics derived from them like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, EBITDA and cash flow. After all, the numbers may tell a different story than the news.\n\nAnd, while that story may not be 100% the opposite of mainstream attention, it might give clues about timing of a price correction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nPlacing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) among overvalued stocks to sell might sound harsh.\n\nHowever, this is a case for investors who want to avoid a potential crash in value. True, Apple is a sweetheart of the modern investing world and one of the Magnificent Seven. Yet, it starts to look small in comparison to the gains of companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Also, AAPL could suffer due to artificial intelligence (AI) hype.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s exactly this kind of energy that Apple is using to draw attention to its stock with its long-awaited announcement of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT coming to Siri and its new Apple Intelligence platform. The company\u2019s share price soared around 7% last week on the news. But it remains questionable whether this software integration will make up for lackluster sales growth. In the meantime, leaks of the iPhone 16\u2019s relative similarity to the previous two generations have done little to generate more hype. This clues in a possible decrease in share value before its release.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite fervent attention and 200% growth in the last year, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) might need a closer look. Putting aside its past sales to Iran and Chinese spyware, the company is well into its most recent price correction. And it likely has a ways to go before finding its new floor.\n\nFor starters, the company\u2019s P/E ratio currently sits at around 47.39x at a price of nearly $840. That\u2019s not cheap in the slightest for a company with a relatively narrow approach to the information technology sector. As a specialized provider of data center technology, SMCI is at the mercy of the rest of the industry continuing to go all in on AI. Should both institutional and retail investors begin to sour on the industry\u2019s prospects, SMCI could continue to dip in price.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, investors should sell SMCI while its price is still high before buying back into a correct position.\n\nReddit (RDDT) An iPhone Plus with a Reddit (RDDT) logo on the screen. Reddit IPO\n\nSource: oasisamuel / Shutterstock.com\n\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) is a newfound member of the New York Stock Exchange as of March 2024. It has a lot to show off since it nearly doubled its valuation since its IPO three months ago. Despite this, the news has focused on Reddit\u2019s deal with OpenAI to allow the company to use Reddit\u2019s vast sea of conversational and informational data for AI training purposes.\n\nWhether or not this approach yields positive results remains uncertain. Yet, it does underscore a factor about Reddit that acts like a double-edged sword. On one hand, people in search of answers rely on search engine results. They may stumble across an old post that helps them. On the other, its niche application and roots in American millennials make it hard to adopt into other countries and cultures.\n\nWhile the stock may be fresh and exciting, it\u2019s certainly difficult to grasp the reason a website platform for public forums and moderated discussion could grow its share value so rapidly. Thus, RDDT stock could be among overvalued stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Beyond Nvidia: Can Super Micro Computer Be the King of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Hardware?",
        "content": "I'll be upfront: Nvidia is the artificial intelligence (AI) king. There's not a lot of evidence to dispute this claim if you consider its reach, business growth, and the universal nature of its graphics processing units (GPUs) that power AI.\n\nHowever, if you move beyond Nvidia, there's still another layer of successful businesses riding the same wave. One of those is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Often referred to as Supermicro, the company builds highly customizable servers that house Nvidia's GPUs to give its clients the computing power they need to run complex models.\n\nSo, could Supermicro be the secondary king of AI? And should it be in your stock portfolio?\n\nStrong growth, but not as much as some would like\n\nBefore the AI boom, Supermicro's business wasn't all that exciting. Although its servers could be tailored to running AI models, conducting drug research, or engineering calculations, that market wasn't that large. However, once the AI arms race kicked off, Supermicro experienced rapid growth in demand for its servers dedicated to AI computing.\n\nBut not everyone is a Supermicro customer. Unlike Nvidia, whose superior products stand apart from the competition, Supermicro has multiple competitors. Hewlett-Packard and Dell are two Supermicro competitors, but their offerings aren't as modular as Supermicro's.\n\nAs a result, the market for Supermicro's services is much smaller than that of Nvidia. Still, that doesn't mean it can't be a successful business. Revenue in the third quarter of Supermicro's fiscal 2024 (ended March 31) rose 200% year over year to $3.85 billion.\n\nThat's incredible growth, but investors found one metric to nitpick: quarterly growth. Revenue was only up 5% quarter over quarter, which indicates that demand isn't rapidly expanding for Supermicro. Compared to Nvidia's Q1 FY 2025 (ending April 28) revenue growth of 18%, Supermicro isn't seeing similar product interest levels.\n\nFor Q4, management expects about $5.3 billion in sales, which would deliver strong quarter-over-quarter growth, but year-over-year growth would decelerate to about 143%. But this brings us to an interesting point: Supermicro's market opportunity.\n\nManagement's revenue goal is within reach\n\nAlso competing with Supermicro are the cloud computing providers. If a business doesn't want to invest capital in building its own server to access the computing power needed to run AI models, it could rent that power from a cloud computing provider like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. However, this business also has a partnership aspect, as Supermicro provides some of the hardware for the big cloud computing companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, management has been upfront with investors about what it believes its market opportunity is. Supermicro set a goal of $25 billion in revenue, and if it hits its Q4 revenue target, it will have nearly $15 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. Although management has raised its revenue goal once already (increasing it from $20 billion), if Supermicro hits its revenue goal, it will still be a very expensive stock. SMCI Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nShould Supermicro generate $25 billion in annual revenue combined with its Q3 profit margin of 10.5%, it would generate about $2.63 billion in profits. At Supermicro's current market capitalization of $45 billion, that would price the stock at 17 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's not a very expensive price, but if that's the business's ceiling, investors may want to pass. Individual investors aim to find strong companies that can compound for years to come. The current AI boom will likely be peak business for Supermicro, so I think investors should turn elsewhere to find other opportunities.\n\nThanks to AI, Supermicro will be a successful company and grow tremendously; the problem is that most of that growth is already priced in.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Supermicro Adding 3 New Manufacturing Facilities in Silicon Valley and Globally to Support the Growth of AI and Enterprise Rack Scale Liquid-Cooled Solutions",
        "content": "Expanded Manufacturing Footprint is Targeted to Bring Global Liquid-Cooled Rack Capacity to More than Double Today's 1,000 AI SuperClusters Shipped Per Month\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif., June 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Supermicro, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI), a Total IT Solution Provider for AI, Cloud, Storage, and 5G/Edge, continues to expand in Silicon Valley with new campuses as the demand for liquid-cooled data center increases. The new facilities will be part of the new liquid-cooled ecosystem, reducing the time needed to deliver to customers worldwide. These new facilities will focus on delivering entire plug-and-play liquid-cooled solutions, from systems to racks to water towers. With AI factories becoming more prevalent, liquid-cooled data centers are critical to meet these increasing customer demands for AI-focused workloads. Liquid-cooled data centers increase the amount of AI compute performance per watt, resulting in more performance per data center. In addition, electricity consumption and environmental impact are reduced, and operational expenses can be up to 40% lower compared to traditional, air-cooled data centers. (PRNewsfoto/Super Micro Computer, Inc.)\n\n\"Supermicro has the highest performing generative deep learning and inferencing AI platform and clusters which benefit from liquid-cooled technologies,\" said Charles Liang, president and CEO of Supermicro. \"Many data center owners are looking for electricity saving Direct Liquid-Cooled solutions. Supermicro is developing building block liquid-cooled solutions for AI factories and the HPC market. We anticipate that liquid-cooled data centers will grow from historically less than 1% to an expected 15% and up to 30% of all data center installations in the next two years. This expansion positions us to capture the majority share of that growth. New data centers will run more efficiently, reducing their carbon footprint, and can be virtually free, compared to air-cooled data centers, with significant operational savings realized through lower electricity use over time.\"\n\nTo learn more about Supermicro's Building Block liquid cooling solutions, click here\n\n\"We are thrilled that Supermicro is expanding in San Jose and leading the charge to reduce the impact of data centers,\" said Matt Mahan, Mayor of San Jose, CA. \"Supermicro represents the best of Silicon Valley as a company that continues to push the boundaries of both technology and sustainability.\"\n\nSupermicro, as a total solution provider, supplies all the components needed for an efficient and optimized liquid-cooled solution. From the Supermicro optimized cold plates to the coolant distribution manifolds (CDMs) to the redundant coolant distribution units (CDUs) and even the external cooling tower, the entire end-to-end solution is designed and tested by Supermicro engineers, which results in a higher quality solution, enabling organizations to get more productive sooner.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany Supermicro servers are explicitly designed for high-performance NVIDIA GPUs for AI processing, such as the very high-density 4U-8GPU systems, the Intel CPU-based SYS-421GE-TNHR2-LCC, or the AMD CPU-based AS -4125GS-TNHR2-LCC. In addition, many Supermicro servers, such as the popular 8U-8GPU systems, are liquid-cooled ready, as well as NVIDIA-based 1U ARS-111GL-NHR-LCC, which includes the Grace Hopper Superchip. Liquid-cooled servers include the 8U-20-node SuperBlade\u00ae, which provides the highest CPU and GPU computing density available today. The 2U-4 node Supermicro BigTwin\u00ae and the 4U-8 node FatTwin\u00ae multi-node servers are optimized for liquid cooling and are in high volume production today.\n\nSupermicro continues to work closely with data center operators to match the right server technology to the demanding workloads, which are unique to each organization and cloud service provider. Many of these application-optimized servers are designed to be liquid-cooled, which reduces the overall operational cost of the data center.\n\nMany customers have limited experience handling liquid inside data centers, requiring vendors to perform the installation and acceptance testing along with future maintenance and warranty service. On-site support is critical, and Supermicro's service organization is highly trained in liquid-cooling deployments.\n\nAbout Super Micro Computer, Inc.\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ: SMCI) is a global leader in Application-Optimized Total IT Solutions.

        "title": "Is Super Micro Computer Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have gone on a roller coaster ride so far this year. The AI server manufacturer's stock racked up gains of more than 300% in less than three months at the beginning of 2024, but it's down 29% since hitting an all-time high in the first half of March.\n\nBut now, Supermicro stock seems to be gaining momentum once again as it rose more than 12% on June 13. This surge was driven by the latest earnings reports from major artificial intelligence (AI) players such as Broadcom and Oracle. While Broadcom raised its forecast for AI chip sales for the current fiscal year, Oracle pointed out that it is building more cloud computing capacity to cater to the massive demand it's seeing.\n\nThese developments bode well for Supermicro, whose AI servers are used for mounting chips used for training and deploying AI models in data centers. However, the stock's latest surge means it has nearly tripled in 2024 already. So is it too late for investors to buy Supermicro stock? Let's find out.\n\nSupermicro isn't expensive despite its impressive surge\n\nSupermicro stock is currently trading at 4.3 times sales. That's lower than the U.S. technology sector's average of 7.8, suggesting the stock is undervalued. A big reason Supermicro's price-to-sales ratio is attractive right now is the fact its share price gains have been backed by outstanding growth on the company's top line.\n\nMore specifically, Supermicro's fiscal 2024 Q3 revenue tripled year over year to $3.85 billion. Additionally, the company has increased its fiscal 2024 revenue guidance to $14.9 billion from the earlier expectation of $14.5 billion (both figures at the midpoint of their respective ranges). The updated guidance means Supermicro's top line is on track to more than double from the previous fiscal year.\n\nMoreover, the company's solid sales growth is also translating into a healthy improvement in its earnings. Its bottom line grew fourfold in the previous quarter to $6.65 per share. The company currently sports an earnings multiple of 43, a small discount to the U.S. tech sector's average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45. However, its forward earnings multiple of 21 indicates its bottom-line growth is set to take off.\n\nAnother multiple that tells us that Supermicro is attractively valued is its price/earnings-to-growth ratio. The PEG ratio takes into consideration a company's potential earnings growth. As a rule of thumb, a PEG ratio of less than 1 means a stock is undervalued based on the potential growth it is expected to deliver, and that's precisely the case for Supermicro:\n\nStory continues SMCI EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThat's not surprising as Supermicro's earnings are expected to grow at an annual rate of 62% over the next five years, powered by huge spending on AI servers.\n\nHigher spending on AI infrastructure is going to be a big catalyst\n\nThe latest earnings reports from Oracle and Broadcom tell us that AI infrastructure spending is growing at an impressive pace. Oracle, for instance, is \"working as quickly as we can to get cloud capacity built out given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline.\" Broadcom, on the other hand, pointed out that hyperscale cloud computing providers are \"accelerating their investments\" to improve the performance of their data centers.\n\nThis is the reason the AI server market is forecast to grow from a size of $31 billion in 2023 to a whopping $430 billion by 2033. That's a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30%. Supermicro is growing at a faster pace than the AI server market overall, suggesting it is the company of choice for data center operators to deploy AI servers.\n\nSupermicro's strategy of quickly churning out cost-efficient server solutions for popular AI chips from leading chipmakers seems to be playing a key role in helping it gain a bigger share of the AI server market. Moreover, the company's focus on quickly adding more production capacity is also allowing it to make a bigger dent in this space.\n\nAll this indicates shares of Supermicro could continue heading higher in the long run. The AI stock carries a median 12-month price target of $1,030 per share among 20 analysts covering it, which represents a 22% gain from current levels.\n\nInvestors who haven't bought this high-flying stock yet should still consider doing so -- it isn't too late.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

Despite this, the company's earnings have grown by 78.6% over the past year and are expected to continue growing at 40.25% annually, outpacing the US market significantly. However, shareholder dilution occurred last year and share price volatility has been high recently. Revenue forecasts also exceed market expectations significantly, indicating potential for sustained growth amid operational expansions like their recent AMD EPYC 4004 CPU servers launch aimed at enhancing computing density and efficiency in cloud-native workloads.\n\nOur earnings growth report unveils the potential for significant increases in Super Micro Computer's future results.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Have Soared 179% or More in 2024 and Could Go Even Higher, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Never ignore the power of momentum. Sometimes the fastest-moving objects are the ones that keep on racing ahead.\n\nThat could be the case with a select group of stocks that have delivered tremendous gains this year. These three stocks have soared 179% or more so far in 2024. They could go even higher, according to Wall Street.\n\n1. Summit Therapeutics\n\nSummit Therapeutics(NASDAQ: SMMT) is sizzling hot this year, with its shares skyrocketing around 220%. All of this huge gain has come since late May.\n\nMany investors had seemingly thrown in the towel on Summit. Before the stock took off, it was down 55% year to date. What happened to turn things around? The company reported surprisingly good results for its lead pipeline candidate.\n\nSummit's ivonescimab, combined with chemotherapy, thumped Merck's blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda in a phase 3 clinical trial as a first-line treatment of patients with PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nIn this study, which was conducted in China, patients receiving the ivonescimab/chemo combo achieved \"statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement\" in progression-free survival compared to those receiving Keytruda, Summit said.\n\nWall Street thinks the stock still has plenty of room to run. All six of the analysts surveyed by LSEG in June rate the stock as a buy or a strong buy. The average 12-month price target for Summit Therapeutics reflects an upside potential of nearly 27%.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have nearly tripled so far in 2024. By mid-March, the tech stock was up 318% year to date before giving up some of its gains.\n\nIt's easy to discern why Super Micro Computer's shares have risen so much. The company reported stellar results for its fiscal second quarter in January and its fiscal third quarter in April.\n\nSupermicro has been one of several beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. It has especially enjoyed strong demand for its AI rack scale plug-and-play solutions.\n\nIn March, Super Micro Computers joined the S&P 500 index. This was a big honor for the company and served as a nice catalyst. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the S&P 500 had to buy Supermicro stock for their portfolios.\n\nThe average 12-month price target for the shares is 21% higher than the current price. However, there isn't a bullish consensus on Wall Street. Of the six analysts surveyed by LSEG this month, only two rate it as a buy, with the other four recommending holding Super Micro Computer.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Viking Therapeutics\n\nSummit isn't the only biotech that has won big this year. Shares of Viking Therapeutics(NASDAQ: VKTX) have soared 179%. At one point earlier in 2024, Viking's stock was up nearly 408% year to date.\n\nThe biggest story for Viking was its announcement in late February of results from a phase 2 study of its experimental obesity drug VK2735. In this study, patients receiving VK2735 experienced up to 13.1% placebo-adjusted mean weight loss. Importantly, the drug's safety profile also looked good.\n\nWall Street remains exceptionally positive about Viking's prospects. The average 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of nearly 120%. The most pessimistic price target is 73% above the current share price.\n\nIs Wall Street right about these high-flying stocks?\n\nI'm unsure if any of these three stocks will hit Wall Street's price targets over the next 12 months. But I suspect all of them could deliver market-beating gains for investors over the next few years.\n\nMy favorite in the group right now is Viking Therapeutics. The company not only has a promising obesity drug; it also has promising therapies targeting the liver disease nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and a rare genetic disorder called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). I think Viking could be a top takeover candidate if its pipeline programs continue to achieve success in clinical testing.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Viking Therapeutics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Viking Therapeutics wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Stock Splits Ahead? 3 AI Stocks Poised to Split After Nvidia",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) superstar stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a stock split on May 22 this year. Share prices have climbed 36% since then. The wild success could have some other AI companies on Wall Street contemplating following suit (even if the split isn't necessarily the sole reason behind the stock's performance).\n\nRemember, a stock split doesn't change anything about the underlying business or the stock's fundamentals. It just divides the stock into more shares with proportionally lower prices and per-share financials. Companies split their stock for numerous reasons, including making shares easier to buy and sell for employees (who might get them as stock options in lieu of payment) and investors.\n\nWith Nvidia finalizing its stock split on June 10, the question that naturally follows is: Which AI companies might be next for a stock split? Three Fool.com contributors identified Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) as those most likely AI stocks to split next.\n\nHere is why.\n\nThis venerable tech giant looks primed for a split\n\nWill Healy(Microsoft): As the company that until very recently had the world's most valuable market cap, Microsoft is not a surprising candidate for a stock split. Considering how much stock price appreciation it has seen in the past few years, the surprising thing about Microsoft's stock is that it has been more than 21 years since Microsoft last split its stock.\n\nBetween the late 1980s and early 2000s, when Microsoft was the dominated PC operating system company, stock splits were much more common. During that period, the stock split nine times.\n\nHowever, the Dot-Com market crash and then the rise of Apple chipped away at Microsoft's leadership over time, particularly after it launched the iPhone in 2007. Between 2000 and 2014, when Steve Ballmer was CEO, Microsoft stock lost 37% of its value.\n\nThe state of the company finally improved when Satya Nadella took the CEO position in 2014. He redefined Microsoft as a cloud company and, later, a leader in AI. Over Nadella's 10-year tenure, Microsoft stock has risen more than 1,110%, taking it to $440 per share as of this writing. MSFT Chart\n\nGiven that level of stock price growth, the need for a split grew as well. The company's growth suggests that stock price appreciation is likely to continue. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), net income increased by 26% year over year. The company's outlook for the rest of the fiscal year points to double-digit percentage revenue growth as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother factor pointing to a stock split involves Microsoft being a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Since the Dow is price-weighted, Microsoft will probably need to split its stock so as not to have an outsized effect on the index's movement. That should ensure that the 21-year stock split drought finally comes to an end.\n\nMeta Platforms has never issued a stock split, but the time may finally be here\n\nJake Lerch (Meta Platforms):All in all, 2024 has been a great year for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Indeed, six of the seven (Tesla being the only exception) have recorded double-digit percentage gains year to date. Yet of these stocks, only one has never split its shares: Meta Platforms. The time for that first-ever split has arrived. Here's why.\n\nFirst off, the stock is expensive. A Meta share trades for around $504 -- placing the stock beyond the reach of many retail investors. By implementing a 3-for-1 or even 5-for-1 stock split, Meta could significantly lower its share price and make the stock more accessible to retail investors who might not be able to buy fractional shares, potentially reducing the price to a more reasonable range of $100 to $175.\n\nA recent study from Bank of America revealed another compelling reason for Meta to split its shares: outperformance. The study, which examined stock splits since 1980, found that stocks that were split beat the S&P 500 during the 12 months that followed the split. This was true in each of the last four decades (see chart below). Image source: Statista\n\nWhile many investors would likely cheer a Meta stock split, it's far from a given. Meta's management isn't a fan of stock splits. In its 12 years as a public company, Meta has never performed a stock split. That's in stark contrast to other tech megacaps like Adobe and Microsoft, who split their shares four and seven times, respectively, in the first 12 years of their existence as public companies.\n\nAt any rate, investors should keep a close eye on Meta Platforms. Stock split or not, the company remains one of the top-performing tech stocks thanks to its lucrative digital advertising business. With its Q1 revenue growing at 27% year over year and earnings soaring 127%, long-term investors would be wise to consider Meta as a buy-and-hold candidate.\n\nSuper Micro Computer could opt to refuel its rally with a stock split\n\nJustin Pope (Super Micro Computer): For a while, Super Micro Computer was seemingly the AI version of Robin to Nvidia's Batman. But share prices have stalled and declined after topping out at $1,229. Meanwhile, Nvidia keeps climbing to new highs. Here is why Super Micro Computer, or Supermicro as it's also known, could still get back on track, necessitating a stock split.\n\nThe company sells modular server systems for data centers. This is great for companies that don't have the expertise or time to custom-build their own and just want to deploy compute as quickly as possible. Like Nvidia, Supermicro has become a \"go-to\" choice as AI spending surges. You can see below how revenue growth has accelerated to 200% year over year, and management has underlined this by noting that demand for its products is dramatically outpacing the broader industry. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nEvidence suggests that Supermicro could benefit from data center tailwinds for some time. According to Newmark, AI will drive enough data center demand to double its power consumption by 2030 from current levels. Supermicro has done nearly $12 billion in trailing-12-month revenue; analysts believe annual revenue could double to over $23 billion by next June.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has a healthy outlook for earnings growth. Analysts believe earnings per share will grow by an average of 52% annually for the next three to five years. In other words, AI tailwinds remain intact, and fundamental strength should eventually push shares higher. Today, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 33, making it a bargain if Supermicro realizes such strong earnings growth. These catalysts could drive Super Micro Computer higher, an exciting prospect for investors.\n\nSo why split the stock?\n\nThe company has never split its stock despite shares appreciating over 9,400% since its IPO. Now, trading at over $800 per share, the stock is harder to buy and sell (less liquid). It's harder for investors to slowly buy shares over time without having a ton of money. Employees sitting on profitable equity in the company must sell in chunks when shares trade at such a price. Splitting the stock lowers the share price and alleviates these problems. Plus, the positive attention a stock split usually generates could help move the share price again after shares have stalled in recent weeks. It's a potential win-win for everyone.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Time to Buy the Dip on Super Micro Computer Stock?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has emerged as one of the big winners amid the artificial intelligence (AI) technology boom.\n\nThe company is capturing strong demand for specialized computer systems as a plug-and-play data center service. On the other hand, the stock has cooled following a spectacular rally at the start of the year. Shares are up 170% in 2024, but also down 37% from their 52-week high set in early March.\n\nWith the tailwind of operating and financial momentum expected to continue, could Super Micro Computer be ready to power up again? I believe so, and here's why.\n\nA critical player in the AI ecosystem\n\nRunning the latest GPU-based AI chips from Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices for high-performance computing requires extensive hardware infrastructure.\n\nEnter Super Micro Computer, whose rack-scale systems integrate all the necessary power, storage, cooling, and software components that make it all work.\n\nBy this measure, the company is benefiting from the explosive growth in complex data processing needs. Supermicro is recognized as building Nvidia-certified GPU server systems, including those that incorporate the newest Blackwell superchips and the B200 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\nSales for the last reported fiscal third quarter reached $3.9 billion, up 200% over the past year. Earnings per share (EPS) of $6.65 grew even faster, climbing 308% from $1.63 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nAll indications are that there is more upside for growth as customers invest heavily in accelerated computing applications including AI and machine learning. Management is guiding for Q4 revenue between $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, representing a 143% midpoint year-over-year increase. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bullish case for investing in Supermicro\n\nSupermicro is moving forward with expanding manufacturing capabilities across its global footprint, including at its facility in San Jose, California, along with operations in Taiwan and Malaysia. The metric that stands out is a planned capacity to produce 5,000 racks per month this year, which marks a major increase from 4,000 at the end of last year, or 3,000 in 2022.\n\nThe company sees room to reach $25 billion in annual sales over the next several years compared to the 2024 guidance range between $14.7 billion and $15.1 billion.\n\nThe driver here is not only a shift toward higher-value opportunities including AI-focused data center products, but also leveraging the installed hardware base into its \"5S Strategy\" covering software, services, switches, storage, and security as a total IT system provider.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne area of optimism is the opportunity to integrate liquid cooling across the product portfolio, which helps make the power-intensive computer systems run more efficiently.\n\nFor the next generation of AI chips and applications, direct liquid cooling (DLC) is seen as a requirement that allows Supermicro to stand out as a differentiated supplier compared to the traditional general computing server manufacturing market.\n\nThat effort can be positive for margins and earnings, which is evident by current Wall Street analyst estimates. Consensus EPS for the rest of fiscal 2024 and the next two years have been trending higher in recent months, indicating confidence in the outlook for Supermicro. The market sees EPS of $23.78 this year, increasing by 42% in fiscal 2025 to $33.73, and again by 24% for fiscal 2026 to $41.92 .\n\nIn my view, shares of Supermicro trading at 23 times next year's consensus earnings offer good value within the tech arena given its growth and earnings momentum. SMCI EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nDespite the share price weakness from Supermicro in recent months, there's a case to be made that its outlook is as strong as ever. The company's solid fundamentals and ability to consolidate its leadership in increasingly high-tech data center infrastructure add to the appeal of the stock as a compelling investment. It likely won't be a straight line higher, but I see more upside for shares moving forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Stocks have enjoyed a strong 2024 on the back of a resilient economy and overall positive earnings results, with the S&P 500 gaining 8% year-to-date. Large-cap technology has helped lead the surge, particularly the beloved \u2018Mag 7\u2019 group.\n\nConcerning notable positivity, three stocks \u2013 Super Micro Computer SMCI, Constellation Energy CEG, and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 reflect a few of the top-performing S&P 500 members in 2024. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s been driving the outsized share performance.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Raises Sales Outlook\n\nSMCI shares have enjoyed a strong run thanks to the AI boom, with shares up nearly a staggering +200% year-to-date. The company is a total IT Solution Provider for AI, Cloud, Storage, and 5G/Edge, reflecting a unique investing angle to ride the frenzy.\n\nAnalysts have been notably bullish, raising their earnings expectations across the board. Strong quarterly results have kept optimism afloat, with the current $23.51 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for its current fiscal year suggesting 100% year-over-year growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company\u2019s growth has been remarkable, posting triple-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth rates in back-to-back periods. Super Micro Computer raised its current year sales outlook into a band of $14.7 - $15.1 billion ($14.3 - $14.7 billion previously) following its latest release thanks to strong demand for AI rack scale solutions.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s sales on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that SMCI joined the S&P 500 back in March of this year.\n\nNvidia Data Center Results Remain Robust\n\nLike SMCI, Nvidia shares have been red-hot thanks to the AI boom, with the company\u2019s robust Data Center results consistently shocking investors. To little surprise, the stock remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), boasting a considerably bullish earnings outlook. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning the latest quarterly release, earnings and revenue grew 460% and 260%, respectively, whereas Data Center sales melted 430% higher from the same period last year. The company\u2019s profitability has shot higher amid margin expansion, as shown below.\n\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares also recently underwent a 10-for-1 split, helping knock down barriers of entry to potential investors. While the split doesn\u2019t reflect any fundamental changes within the company, it\u2019s still a positive development and reflects an investor-friendly nature.\n\nStory continues\n\nConstellation Energy Goes Nuclear for AI\n\nCEG\u2019s share performance has been driven by bullish outlooks regarding power consumption. In early May, the company stated that it\u2019s in discussions to provide nuclear energy for data centers, with projects expected to begin in the coming years.\n\nAnalysts have taken note of its favorable stance, raising earnings expectations and pushing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nJoe Dominguez, CEO, on the company\u2019s latest quarterly results, \u201cWe had another strong quarter as support grows for nuclear energy as a reliable, clean source to meet growing demand from electric vehicles, heavy industry and emerging technologies, such as AI and related digital infrastructure.\u201d\n\nLike those above, shares reflect an angle to ride the AI frenzy.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that AI bullishness has pushed many stocks higher in 2024, a list that includes several S&P 500 members such as Super Micro Computer SMCI, Constellation Energy CEG, and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nAll three have seen their earnings outlooks move higher, further reflecting the positive sentiment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See Super Micro (SMCI) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Super Micro Computer (SMCI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nSuper Micro currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.92, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.92 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SMCI Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for SMCI\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Super Micro here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Super Micro, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs SMCI a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Super Micro, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $23.51.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Super Micro. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Super Micro.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is There Now An Opportunity In Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI)?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine Super Micro Computer\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Super Micro Computer?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 12% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Super Micro Computer today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $990.36, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Super Micro Computer\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat does the future of Super Micro Computer look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Super Micro Computer. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? SMCI\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on SMCI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Super Micro Computer (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Super Micro Computer, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "The Only 7 Data Center Stocks Investors Need In Order to Capitalize on AI",
        "content": "It\u2019s hard to argue against the notion that artificial intelligence (AI) is the biggest opportunity that most of us will ever see in our lifetimes. AI is already changing the way humans work and will continue to do so. AI is not only changing work, it is also changing all aspects of society. Name something humans do and AI is likely being applied to improve that process. That said, the current biggest opportunity appears to be in data centers, at least for stock investors.\n\nData centers account for the majority of demand for AI chips at this point. Thus, investors should simply follow the money in order to capture returns. These companies are investing heavily in AI and have tremendous opportunities to grow as AI matures.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) stock represents the parent company of Google. The two names are used synonymously but for the purpose of ease I\u2019ll just use Google. Anyway, Google is one of the biggest data center stocks and represents a clear opportunity to capitalize massively on AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA report from a few months ago is very telling. It noted that Google is pouring billions into increasing its overall data center footprint. That investment includes several massive capital outlays for data centers across the United States. It also includes plans for substantial data center investments in Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, New Zealand, Greece, Norway, Austria and Sweden.\n\nEssentially, Alphabet is rapidly investing to build out the infrastructure necessary for its AI aspirations. It is one of several important hyperscaler companies with the resources to capture a significant portion of the AI market.\n\nInvestors should expect Google to continue thriving throughout 2024, especially in light of its strong first-quarter results. Ad revenues are again strong and those results, along with the data center investment, imply that the stock is a strong buy at the moment\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is up nearly 20% in 2024. A lot of that strong performance is attributable to the company\u2019s future opportunity in AI. The company is heavily promoting its recent investment in data centers, sending a strong signal to markets.\n\nAmazon is set to spend an average of $10 billion annually over the next 15 years to retain its dominant cloud position. The company announced the $150 billion bet in late March. The heavy capital infusion will go toward creating the necessary resources to handle an anticipated spike in AI application demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is unloading the majority of that capital infusion early on. The company has already announced well over $20 billion in data center project investments in 2024. The company is also directing some of that investment toward the creation of wind and solar farms. That is unsurprising as data center energy consumption is rapidly increasing. Companies like Amazon have also promised to reduce their carbon emissions. They will therefore rely on clean energy sources including solar and wind to power the increased data center footprint.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has capitalized on the AI boom as well as any company. The stock exploded upward in 2023, primarily as a result of its investment in OpenAI. Microsoft\u2019s heavy connection to the ChatGPT creator gives the company a strong head start in AI over many of its competitors.\n\nWhile that shrewd investment sent shares skyrocketing in 2023, 2024 has been slower. Microsoft stock is up a very respectable 13% during the year, but that remains somewhat behind the growth of its peer group.\n\nData center investments may be the catalyst to propel it upward again with greater velocity. In April it was reported that Microsoft had more than 5 gigawatts (GW) of data center capacity at its disposal. Microsoft added 500 megawatts of that overall capacity since July of 2023. The company intends to add one additional gigawatt of capacity during the first half of 2024. In 2025, Microsoft intends to add an additional 1.5 gigawatts of data center capacity during H1.\n\nMicrosoft continues to gobble up the AI GPUs necessary for use in those data centers. It\u2019s news to no one, but Microsoft continues to be an excellent AI stock.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who have been paying attention know that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has also placed its bets on AI digital infrastructure this year. That\u2019s an excellent reason to invest in the stock at this time.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024 it was reported that Meta Platforms expected to spend between $30 to $37 billion on digital infrastructure investments in 2024. That was an increase of $2 billion over previous expectations at the high end. When the company released first quarter earnings in late April, that range increased again to between $35 to $40 billion.\n\nIf AI is truly the next groundbreaking opportunity then it\u2019s clear the infrastructure required to process the workloads is the current prime opportunity. If it weren\u2019t, the Meta Platforms of the world wouldn\u2019t be so rapidly increasing their data center investments.\n\nInvest in Meta Platforms because its ad business is again thriving but understand that the company is making massive headway in relation to AI. That investment promises to strengthen what is already one of the\u00a0 strongest companies globally.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has quickly become the most important AI stock. Investors are well aware that the company\u2019s chips dominate AI and remain in high demand. However, those same investors may not realize how important data center opportunities are to Nvidia overall.\n\nThose investors who do dig a little bit deeper will quickly realize that data center revenues are far and away the primary driver for Nvidia. Company-wide revenues grew by 18% during the most recent quarter, reaching $26.0 billion. $22.6 billion of those revenues were attributable to data center sales. All of the aforementioned hyperscaler companies above continue to gobble up Nvidia\u2019s chips for use in their data centers.\n\nNvidia\u2019s gross margins continue to grow and are fast approaching 80% overall. Margins at that level suggest incredible economics at the company. Nvidia benefits from a clear competitive advantage that makes it highly investable even today With prices above $1,200 per share. Shares will trade for much less by the time you read this as the company will have affected a stock split that lowers the price. That promises to increase liquidity which should drive demand higher, sending prices higher in the process.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is clearly the riskiest stock on this list of data center investments to capitalize on AI. Share prices have risen from $285 at the beginning of the year to a high of $1,200 mid-March. They have since retreated to $800 but there\u2019s reason to believe that now is time to invest again.\n\nSuper Micro Computer leverages leading chip technology, integrating it into modular plug-and-play AI-enabled hardware currently in high demand. That includes Nvidia\u2019s newest Blackwell GPU chips.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s hardware like its AI SuperCluster will continue to be in high demand for data center applications. The company is one of the newer and more interesting generative AI plays available to investors.\n\nI would argue that now is an excellent time to pick up Super Micro Computer following Nvidia\u2019s recent strong performance. Nvidia\u2019s earnings report should have sent a wave of relief across the markets in relation to AI. I believe that relief will manifest as renewed demand in companies like Super Micro Computer moving forward.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor the more risk-averse investor looking to capitalize on data center AI, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)\u00a0 is an excellent stock choice. The company sells Internet Protocol (IP) networking equipment and touches heavily on data center products overall.\n\nIt is one of the first investments to consider for those seeking income from the tech sector. Cisco Systems includes a healthy dividend yielding nearly 3.5%. So, investors should consider it for the combination of stable income and strong data center/AI exposure.\n\nMeanwhile, Cisco Systems also recently launched a $1 billion dollar AI fund aiming to take stakes in upstart AI companies. That investment exposes Cisco Systems to Greater future growth potential which could in turn increase the income its stock provides.Furthermore, Cisco Systems is working hand in hand with Nvidia to simplify the deployment of generative AI applications.\n\nCSCO shares continue to represent an excellent and safe investment in AI growth that won\u2019t keep you up at night while also exposing you to secular growth across AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "This New S&amp;P 500 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Growing 5 Times Faster Than Its Industry",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has stirred up a lot of excitement in the investment community -- and for good reason. The technology has what it takes to reshape just about every industry and our daily lives, so there's possibly a real revolution ahead. And giants in the field, from Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, say that AI may represent a bigger transformation than the Internet.\n\nAI promises new and better medicines more quickly, for example, and more efficiency across businesses and in our daily lives. Conversational assistants that have been released in recent times could be just the beginning. And analysts predict the AI market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade, suggesting we're really in the early days of this growth story right now.\n\nToday is a great time to get in on players that could stand out in this exciting industry. Recently, the S&P 500 recognized one by including it in the index -- confirmation that it's one of the most valuable publicly traded companies today. AI is driving explosive growth for this particular player, and the company has even grown five times faster than its industry over the past 12 months. Read on to find out more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA 30-year-old company\n\nMany companies can be considered AI players today -- from those that make chips and components or sell AI services to those that are using the technology to improve their businesses or innovate. The one that the S&P 500 recently welcomed isn't new to the terrain -- the company recently celebrated its 30th nniversary. But this player's business, after slow and steady growth over time, took off along with the AI boom, thanks to its business with AI customers.\n\nI'm talking about Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), the developer of workstations, servers, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment powering data centers and AI projects. The company reported its first $3 billion quarter recently -- an amount that it made in one year back in 2021. And the stock has soared a mind-boggling 2,000% over three years.\n\nAs mentioned, Supermicro has posted growth that's beaten the industry average over the past year or so, and now the questions are: \"Why?\" and \"Can it continue?\"\n\nFirst, a look at why Supermicro has been so successful. The company's had a few decades to build its capabilities and expertise, so now, with AI demand soaring, it's ready to deliver.\n\nOn top of this, customers are seeking Supermicro's equipment for two particular reasons. The company's building-blocks technology -- with common elements used throughout product lines -- help it to quickly customize each individual product to suit a customer's needs. And Supermicro works closely with chipmakers such as Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices so that it may include their latest chips in its equipment.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecord demand in recent quarters\n\nA customer can get the latest technology quickly and tailored to its particular project. This is a huge plus and obviously has kept customers with AI plans flocking to Supermicro. The company has reported record demand in recent quarters for its AI systems at rack scale including chips made by the world's top players.\n\nNow let's consider whether this demand could continue. The general growth environment should act as a tailwind for Supermicro as more and more companies launch and scale up AI projects in the coming years. So the backdrop is positive. Supermicro's building-blocks construction method and work with chipmakers should continue to be favorable, too, and the company is ramping up production with a focus on lower cost and higher volume at a new factory in Malaysia.\n\nFinally, Supermicro could win thanks to its development of direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology. AI data centers are heat-intensive, so the need for a green and efficient cooling system is enormous. This could be the next growth driver for Supermicro. The company expects its DLC systems to take as much as 30% market share in the coming two years, the Taipei Times reported, citing Supermicro's presentation at the Computex event.

        "content": "Some believe that the Street always values companies more or less correctly and is never completely wrong about companies\u2019 outlooks. But history shows this concept is completely incorrect. In the last few years, the Street massively underestimated the value of two stocks that large investors completely overlooked: Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) and American Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC).\n\nSuper Micro specializes in making servers used to facilitate artificial (AI). It was a little-known company that was changing hands for around $55 in October 2022. Today, after the stock\u2019s massive gains in the wake of the AI boom, SMCI stock is worth around $775 per share. The trend was largely unforeseen by the Street until the end 2022.\n\nSimilarly, large investors were completely unenthused about American Superconductor until recently. The company develops systems that facilitate the smooth flow of electricity, along with components of wind turbines and Navy ships. As recently as October 2023, shares changed hands for a paltry $6.50. However, the firm\u2019s recent strong fiscal fourth-quarter results finally made the Street realize the company was benefiting from multiple, strong positive catalysts. AMSC stock is now worth about $23.50.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three overlooked small-cap stocks that can similarly become beloved by the Street.\n\nRedwire (RDW) A concept art of an astronaut with a space secene behind. Space Stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRedwire (NYSE:RDW) provides products and infrastructure that facilitates space travel. The company appears to be benefiting from the relatively recent, renewed emphasis by America and other countries on space travel.\n\nRedwire provided the cameras that were used byIntuitive Machines\u2019 (NASDAQ:LUNR) lunar lander that successfully touched down on the Moon in February. It also provided \u201cdeployment mechanisms and 100-foot booms\u201d for NASA\u2019s Solar Sail system. As a result, it appears the company is well-positioned to benefit from NASA\u2019s revitalization.\n\nSimilarly, Redwire recently disclosed the European Space Agency\u00a0chose it to provide a robotic arm prototype for the agency\u2019s lunar lander. So it seems the company will benefit from the EU\u2019s future space missions. Finally, the company is developing \u201c18 ship sets of antennas and radio frequency hardware\u201d for Rocket LabUSA (NASDAQ:RKLB), which is developing satellites for the U.S. Space Force.\n\nIn the first quarter, Redwire\u2019s revenue of $87.8 million climbed 52% compared to the same period a year earlier. Its net cash provided by operating activities also rose by $16.8 million year-over-year to $2.8 million. Last, Redwire\u2019s pipeline rose to a very impressive $6.8 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven Redwire\u2019s strong positive catalysts and its impressive financial performance, it is one of the best small-cap stocks to buy.\n\nMayville Engineering (MEC) The fiber laser cutting machine cutting the sheet metal plate with the sparking light.Hi-technology manufacturing concept.\n\nSource: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com\n\nMayville Engineering (NYSE:MEC) provides products for manufacturers. Among the functions carried out by its offerings are \u201cproduction, design, prototyping, tooling (and) fabrication.\u201d\n\nThe company is likely benefiting from multiple, strong trends including the onshoring of manufacturing, the rising production of electric vehicle batteries and solar panels and the increased production of semiconductors.\n\nMayville\u2019s revenue rose 9% last year to $588.4 million. Management said it is getting a lift from increased orders from military contractors and commercial vehicle makers.\n\nIn Q1, the company\u2019s year-over-year sales growth accelerated to an impressive 13% while adjusted EBITDA advanced 34% to $18.5 million versus the same period a year earlier. The annual run rate of adjusted EBITDA is $74 million. With Mayville\u2019s current market capitalization of $343 million, the shares are changing hands at a very low price-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.6 times.\n\nEVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nEV charging company EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) has a very close partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM). Not only can GM\u2019s EVs be easily charged at EVgo\u2019s facilities but the automaker often provides its buyers with free charging services through EVgo. And GM is helping to finance the construction of 2,000 EVgo chargers nationwide.\n\nTherefore, the fact that GM sold a record total of more than 9,000 EVs last month is certainly great news for EVgo and EVGO stock. In addition to the high likelihood that many of the owners of these new EVs will likely use EVgo\u2019s chargers on their road trips, GM\u2019s performance shows the inaccuracy of predictions of the demise of the EV sector in general and GM\u2019s EV business in particular. Once the Street internalizes the fact that EVs have a bright future in America, EVGO stock should rally tremendously.\n\nIn Q1, EVgo\u2019s top line more than doubled YOY to $55.2 million, and the company expects to break even on an EBITDA basis in 2025.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in EVGO, AMSC, and SMCI.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Is Surging Today",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock is making big gains in Thursday's trading. The company's share price was up 10% as of 12:45 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nWhile there wasn't any business-specific news for the company, strong earnings for Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), promising developments for Oracle, and continued momentum for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are powering big gains for Super Micro's share price today. The high-performance server specialist's stock is now up more than 200% year to date.\n\nBroadcom's big quarter flashes buy signals for Super Micro stock\n\nHigh-profile AI stocks have frequently traded in tandem with each other this year. When one company posts better-than-expected earnings results or secures a major new contract or partnership, that has often been enough to power substantial gains for other players in the space. On the heels of Broadcom's better-than-expected quarterly results, Super Micro Computer stock appears to be benefiting from that dynamic.\n\nBroadcom, a connectivity semiconductor and software company, posted better-than-expected quarterly sales and earnings performance after the market closed yesterday. The tech specialist reported non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $10.96 on sales of $12.49 billion for the second quarter of its current fiscal year, which ended May 5. Revenue was up roughly 43% year over year in the period, with rising demand for AI-related technologies helping to spur growth. Meanwhile, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to post adjusted per-share earnings of $10.84 on sales of $12.01 billion. In addition to posting sales and earnings beats, the company also raised its full-year performance outlook.\n\nOracle's promising guidance presents another buy signal\n\nBroadcom's beat-and-raise quarter came on the heels of a promising report from Oracle earlier in the week. While Oracle's quarterly sales and earnings performance actually came in lower than Wall Street had expected, the company's management issued very encouraging guidance.\n\nIn particular, Oracle looks to be scoring significant wins in AI and the cloud infrastructure market. Because Super Micro is a provider of high-end rack servers used for artificial intelligence, data centers, and other accelerated computing applications, good news for Broadcom and Oracle this week also bodes well for Super Micro stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The S&P 500 Index has been on an incredible rally this year, achieving new milestones and gaining 13.6% so far. The index has now crossed the 5,400 level for the first time after hitting the 5,300 threshold last month, underscoring strong confidence. The latest leg of the rally came on cooler-than-expected inflation data despite hawkish commentary from the Fed (read: ETFs in Focus on the Upcoming S&P 500 Shake-Up).\r\n\r\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has gained 13.3% in the year-to-date timeframe.

Easing inflation indicates that the economy is stabilizing, and interest rates may be declining.\r\n\r\nIn the latest FOMC meeting concluded yesterday, U.S. policymakers penciled in just one rate cut this year and foresee four cuts in 2025. The Fed altered language in its statement, noting there has been \u201cmodest further progress toward the committee\u2019s 2% inflation objective.\u201d Previously, the statement pointed to a \u201clack\u201d of further progress. The Fed meeting signals a period of higher interest rates for some more time, which will continue to act as a positive thrust for S&P 500 due to its less volatile nature (read: 5 Large-Cap ETFs at the Forefront of the Market Rally This Year).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, strong earnings growth and the artificial intelligence (AI) craze have been driving stocks higher. In particular, the \"Magnificent Seven\" is the biggest engine of growth for the technology sector and the S&P 500 as a whole. It now accounts for 31% of the weightage in the S&P 500.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.\n\nSPY in Focus\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.1% of the assets.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Ready to Split",
        "content": "Stock splits are back in the spotlight after Nvidia took this step recently. Investors should remember that this is simply a cosmetic move that doesn't change the value and fundamentals of a company. What a stock split does is increase the number of outstanding shares while reducing the price of each share. So, the overall market value of the company remains the same.\n\nHowever, there is a belief that a stock split might increase demand for a company's shares because more investors would be able to buy them, with each share now available at a lower price.\n\nThat's probably one reason why the likes of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) could consider splitting their shares. Let's check why these two companies, which are playing a crucial role in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, look ripe for a stock split.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nThe stock of Super Micro Computer (also known as Supermicro) has tripled in value over the past year and is now worth just over $760 a share. However, it's still down 34% from the 52-week high that it hit in March, which is why management might consider splitting the stock to attract investor interest.\n\nSupermicro has never executed a stock split. Management probably didn't feel the need to do so because shares were trading at around $80 at the end of 2022. However, the booming demand for its AI server solutions has led to an 858% increase in its share price since the beginning of 2023. That means Supermicro has jumped by a multiple of more than 9 in less than 18 months.\n\nThat's why the time looks ripe for a stock split at Supermicro. However, because a split is nothing more than a cosmetic move, now would be a good time to buy its shares regardless of a split to take advantage of the recent pullback in the stock's price.\n\nAfter all, the demand for Supermicro's AI servers is so strong that its revenue tripled in the third quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31) to $3.85 billion, and adjusted net income quadrupled year over year to $6.65 per share.\n\nManagement has guided for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $5.3 billion and expects adjusted earnings to land at $8.02 per share at the midpoint of its guidance range. The company reported $2.18 billion in revenue in the same quarter last year along with adjusted earnings of $3.51 per share. If it meets its forecast, the top and bottom lines are set to more than double once again in the current quarter.\n\nAnd Supermicro can sustain its healthy growth in the long run since the AI server market that it supplies is forecast to grow 26% annually for the next five years. AI server sales are predicted to increase from just over $12 billion in 2023 to more than $50 billion in 2029.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are some more-ambitious estimates as well, with contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn expecting AI server sales to hit $150 billion in 2027.\n\nSupermicro's recent results indicate that it is growing faster than the AI server market, a sign that it is gaining ground in this space. In all, the company's lucrative AI-related opportunity and its rapid growth are solid reasons to buy the stock now. What's more, Supermicro is trading at just 21 times forward earnings, a discount to the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 28 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).\n\nSo, investors have a nice opportunity to buy this AI stock, and they should consider taking advantage, considering its healthy prospects are not going to be affected by a stock split.\n\n2. ASML Holding\n\nASML Holding is another company that could consider splitting its stock, with each share now trading at just over $1,040. The last time the Dutch supplier of semiconductor-manufacturing equipment executed a split was in October 2007, and its shares have surged 2,250% since then.\n\nThese impressive gains are a result of the central role that it plays in the semiconductor industry, and not because of its split almost 17 years ago.\n\nASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines allow foundries to make chips for a variety of applications. And AI is a catalyst that has customers lining up to buy its EUV machines to manufacture advanced chips using process nodes of 7 nanometers (nm), 5nm, 3nm, or smaller. The smaller the process node, the more powerful and efficient the chip is.\n\nAs the need for AI chips grows, ASML is witnessing robust demand for its EUV machines, and the company was sitting on an order backlog worth 38 billion euros ($40.9 billion) at the end of the first quarter of 2024. That's higher than the company's 2024 annual revenue forecast of $29.6 billion, which is in line with its revenue in 2023.\n\nManagement forecasts an acceleration in revenue growth in the second half of 2024 thanks to the recovery in the semiconductor market. Moreover, the company is set to start delivering its new machine, priced at $380 million, to semiconductor suppliers this year to help them manufacture advanced AI chips.\n\nThe market for those chips is forecast to clock annual growth of 38% through 2032, so ASML should continue to witness healthy demand for its EUV machines. And because it is the only manufacturer of these machines, it's no surprise to see its earnings growth being predicted to accelerate significantly next year. ASML EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSo even if the company doesn't split its stock to lower the value of each share, its prospects suggest that it is built for more upside in the long run. Investors looking for a semiconductor stock with a mission-critical role in the AI revolution can consider buying ASML Holding before its growth accelerates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

These are the tech stocks that get the highest possible ranking in the Portfolio Grader, and therefore are positioned to do well as we close out the second quarter of the year.\n\nA-rated tech stocks to buy are valued because of their sterling performance and massive growth potential. Tech stocks have been outperforming the market over the last several quarters, driven by advances in generative artificial intelligence, large language models, the Internet of Things and machine learning. Each of these advances expands the role of technology in everyday life and makes the products these companies develop more valued by consumers.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is up 15% this year, outpacing both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. I expect that trend to continue through the rest of the year, making it even more important that investors look for A-rated tech stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks based on momentum, earnings performance, analyst sentiment and growth history to assign grades of \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for the best A-rated tech stocks to buy for your portfolio, then look no further.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an obvious choice to continue to outperform the market. The semiconductor company has a market capitalization approaching $3 trillion, and the stock is up by more than 200% over the last 12 months.\n\nNvidia makes the powerful H100 graphics processing units that are needed to power generative AI applications. And it\u2019s H200 is even more powerful.\n\nThis year Nvidia will be launching its Blackwell platform, which will allow customers to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25 times less cost and energy consumption.\n\nThe market for generative AI and top-performing semiconductors isn\u2019t going away \u2013 in fact, it will just get stronger. Nvidia has as much as 90% of the addressable market, putting it in a prime position to continue to profit.\n\nThe company also just executive at 10-for-1 stock split, which makes the stock even more affordable to retail investors and will help drive the price higher still.\n\nNVDA stock is up 144% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is actually in a slump right now, with the stock price falling below $800 after flirting with $1,200 in March.\n\nStory continues\n\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s a huge overreaction by the market, and I\u2019m betting on SMCI to reverse course and return to its winning ways. Getting SMCI stock at $770 looks like a bargain.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings report was solid. Sales tripled from a year ago and earnings per share were up by a factor of four. Supermicro increased its guidance from $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion previously, to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion currently.\n\nSupermicro makes the server architecture that is needed to bundle Nvidia\u2019s high-performing products so they can work together to run AI applications. That need is going to be there, particularly as Nvidia continues to improve its platforms and sell its products.\n\nSupermicro\u2019s stock is still on a tremendous run. Remember, this is a company that started with a stock price of less than $300 at the beginning of the year. Shares are up 170% so far in 2024 despite the pullback over the last two months.\n\nSMCI stock gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is a tried-and-true technology stock.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have all been phenomenal investments during that time.\n\nHere's how much a $25,000 investment back at the end of the Great Recession in these three high-powered tech stocks would be worth right now.\n\nNvidia: $10.7 million\n\nNvidia's gains in just the past few years alone have been amazing. The stock has been red-hot, as its name has become synonymous with AI and the opportunities related to developing chatbots and next-gen technologies. Companies are falling over themselves to partner with Nvidia in the hopes of cashing in on not just opportunities, but the hype that comes along with saying that you're doing business with Nvidia.\n\nInvesting just $25,000 in Nvidia at the end of the Great Recession would have made you more than a millionaire, as your investment would be worth nearly $11 million. And at this rate, it may eclipse that mark before the end of the year.\n\nEven though the stock isn't cheap, trading at 70 times its trailing earnings, investors remain bullish. Shares of Nvidia are up over 140% this year. The business has been tripling its revenue, and investors and analysts still see much more future growth on the horizon. Predicting how much higher this already scorching-hot stock can go is no easy task.\n\nIt's hard to go wrong with Nvidia, with its leadership in the AI chip market and the need for its data center products, but investors should start to consider tempering their expectations, given the stock's mammoth $3 trillion valuation.\n\nAmazon: $1.1 million\n\nAmazon might be the original AI stock, back when investing in AI stocks wasn't really even a thing. The tech company has been using AI to revolutionize its logistics business for years, including using robots to help move packages and create efficiencies in its warehouses. More recently, it has also gotten into the chatbot wars with its $4 billion investment into Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude 3, a rival to ChatGPT.\n\nHow it all plays out is still anyone's guess, but it's fair to say AI will remain a big part of Amazon's world. One example of the potential is its partnership with UVeye, where the two companies are using AI to help automate vehicle inspections. Amazon is also planning to monetize an AI-powered version of its Alexa assistant. There are many growth opportunities still out for this near-$2 trillion business to become more valuable in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting $25,000 into Amazon 15 years ago would have made you a millionaire today. Still, at an earnings multiple of more than 50 and without its sales skyrocketing (Amazon's revenue rose by 13% year-over-year in the first quarter),this is another tech stock investors should tread carefully with. Given its inflated valuation, it may be worth taking a bit of a wait-and-see approach with Amazon stock.\n\nSuper Micro: $2.5 million\n\nSuper Micro, also known as just Supermicro, had not outperformed Amazon over the past 15 years until recently. It wasn't until the recent hype in AI and chatbots that ignited a flame under this tech stock. But now, this fast-growing business is among the hottest AI stocks to own.\n\nThe company provides many solutions for AI, including servers, which has been a massive growth opportunity for the business. During the first three months of the year, Supermicro has reported $3.9 billion in net sales -- three times the $1.3 billion it reported a year earlier. Its profits also look fantastic, jumping from $85.8 million in the prior-year period to $402.5 million this past quarter.\n\nSupermicro is technically the cheapest stock on this list, with a price-to-earnings multiple of just 43. And its market cap of $45 billion is by far the lightest. Based on those metrics, this is the stock that may have the most upside, given its strong growth prospects to help provide companies with AI solutions and servers. So if you're going to buy an AI stock, Supermicro may be one of the better options to add to your portfolio right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies That Could Follow Nvidia's Lead and Split Their Stock",
        "content": "Stock splits generate a lot of buzz in the investing world, especially among the amateur crowd. You probably already know that a split doesn't affect the company's underlying value -- if you have one share worth $100 and the company executes a 10-for-1 split, you would have 10 shares worth $10 each for the same $100 value.\n\nHowever, there are some advantages to shrinking per-share prices. For example, it's easier for smaller investors to accumulate a position. Let's say you put $300 into an account monthly; it's easier to accumulate a position in a stock selling for $100 than $2,000. The announcements also draw attention to the company, which is potentially of help.\n\nNvidia is the latest big tech company to announce a split (its second in the past three years). The stock split 10-for-1 last week after an incredible run over the previous few years, as shown below. But Nvidia isn't the only company with a swelling stock price. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom sent several other stocks to all-time highs.\n\nCould one of these below be next to split their stock?\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nLet's look first at Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), which trades above $750 per share. This is well below its 52-week high of $1,229 but well above the 52-week low price of $213. Supermicro (as its known) is a nuts-and-bolts play in the AI sector, as its server, storage, and networking hardware are critical to data centers, edge computing, and more.\n\nThe intense customer demand, primarily driven by AI, caused revenue and operating income to skyrocket recently, as shown below. SMCI Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company's latest quarter saw 200% year-over-year sales growth to $3.9 billion, and Supermicro expects intense growth to continue next quarter with a forecast of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion. The great thing about this sales growth is that Supermicro is doing it profitably, as you can see by the rising operating income in the chart above. Data center growth is a tailwind that should last for years (check out this article for details).\n\nIf the stock price stays high, the company could move to split the stock -- potentially soon.\n\nServiceNow\n\nCompanies are turning to automation like never before. Automating tasks is critical to efficiency, which is paramount in the hyper-competitive business world. With the Now Platform provided by ServiceNow(NYSE: NOW), customers get virtual customer service agents, process automation, and AI-based issue detection, routing, and problem-solving solutions.\n\nServiceNow has an expanding customer base of over 8,100, including 85% of the Fortune 500. This includes nearly 2,000 large customers that spend an average of $4.6 million each with ServiceNow annually. The company also boasts a 98% renewal rate. Like Supermicro, ServiceNow's sales and operating profits are soaring, as shown below.\n\nStory continues NOW Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe $9.5 billion in trailing-12-month sales above include $2.6 billion in the first quarter, a 24% increase over the prior year. ServiceNow's stock price has followed suit and trades near $700 per share. If the stock remains elevated, ServiceNow could follow other tech companies and consider a split.\n\nIn the grand scheme of the stock market, stock splits aren't very consequential. They best serve investors by keeping most stocks trading within the same relative range. It would complicate things if all companies did what Berkshire Hathaway did; its stock trades for over $600,000 per share after decades of growth without splitting (although investors can still buy the Class B shares much more cheaply).\n\nStill, stock splits garner attention, open the market up to smaller investors, and create fun topics of conversation. Nvidia is the latest titan to split; more could soon follow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market has helped the company's earnings skyrocket in recent years. The tech giant makes the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), which fuel key AI tasks such as the training and inferencing of models. This has prompted investors to flock to Nvidia, pushing the shares to a gain of nearly 600% over the past three years.\n\nIn fact, Nvidia's stock rose so high -- well past $900 -- that the company recently executed a stock split to bring the price down and make the shares more accessible for employees and investors.\n\nAnd Nvidia's growth opportunity isn't over, as the AI story is just getting started, meaning high demand should continue. Analysts predict the AI market will surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nIt's important to remember, though, that Nvidia isn't the only company that may benefit from this AI boom. And if you're looking for a top AI buy right now, other players may offer you a chance for a bigger win -- so you might want to forget Nvidia for a moment and check out the following two AI players instead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) is known for its dominance in central processing units (CPUs), the key processor in computers, but the company fell behind in the race to power AI projects -- and this has weighed on stock performance. The shares have dropped more than 45% over the past three years. But two important catalysts could turn things around for Intel, and even send the shares roaring higher.\n\nFirst, Intel is putting a major focus on AI and recently announced the launch of new game-changing products such as the Xeon 6 processors with Efficient-cores and the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator. These products help data center customers gain in performance and efficiency -- while keeping their costs down. The Gaudi 3, for example, is as much as a third lower in cost when compared to the competition. So Intel may be a great option for cost-conscious customers looking for solid performance.\n\nSecond, Intel may be on the road to generating significant revenue from making chips for others. The company launched a foundry operation with the goal of becoming the world's second-biggest foundry by 2030. Initially this involves investment, and earnings gains won't happen overnight -- but this could be worth the wait. Intel already is signing on customers for its processes, and its position as the only close-to-home foundry for North American customers could be a big selling point.\n\nToday, Intel shares trade for about 28x times forward earnings estimates, a bargain for this company with a solid earnings track record and new lasting growth catalysts just ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) shares have soared in recent years as the company, much like Nvidia, serves the needs of customers launching AI projects. Supermicro makes the workstations, servers, and full rack scale solutions that populate data centers. The company has been around for more than 30 years, slowly growing revenue -- and then, with the AI boom, revenue soared.\n\nEarlier this year, Supermicro reported its first $3 billion quarter -- that was the level of revenue the company reported for an entire year as recently as in 2021. So Supermicro has made enormous progress in a short period of time.\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro should benefit well into the future as this AI growth story, still in its early days, unfolds. But here's why it's an even better buy than the big chip designer. Supermicro actually benefits not only when Nvidia releases new chips but also when other chipmakers like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices do. That's because Supermicro works hand-in-hand with chip leaders so that it can include their latest products in its equipment for customers.\n\nAll of this means that Supermicro benefits from general demand for AI equipment, as well as demand for chips from all the big players. On top of this, Supermicro's technique of working closely with these companies means it can build equipment quickly -- and customers, eager to get projects going, like this speed.\n\nEven after recent gains, Supermicro stock today is trading for 33x forward earnings estimates -- a dirt cheap level, considering the company's growth so far and long-term prospects.\n\nSo, yes, Nvidia still is a top stock to buy, but Intel and Supermicro look like even better buying opportunities right now -- and ones that could help you greatly benefit from the AI growth story.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The\u00a0S&P 500 has delivered solid long-term returns. The index periodically adds and removes stocks based on their overall performance to generate higher returns for long-term investors. However, the S&P 500 tends to add stocks to its index after they have enjoyed incredible rallies.\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) and Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) joined the S&P 500 in Q1 2024. It made sense for these stocks to get added because they fulfilled the requirements and generated plenty of fanfare. However, most of the gains were already recorded.\n\nSupermicro is down since its inclusion to the S&P 500 despite logging a 4,400% gain over the past five years. Deckers Outdoor is up since joining the S&P 500, but investors missed out on a 500% gain over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wait for stocks to join the S&P 500 before investing in them. These are some of the top growth stocks that can 10x by 2030.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) followed in the footsteps of Supermicro and Deckers Outdoor. It recently joined the S&P 500 and delivered most of its gains before joining the index. However, Crowdstrike can still deliver massive returns and has the potential to become a $1 trillion company in a decade.\n\nThe cybersecurity industry is projected to maintain a\u00a013.8% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2030. The rise of online hackers and artificial intelligence should boost the company\u2019s demand.\n\nAnother key factor working in Crowdstrike\u2019s factor is its solid earnings. Revenue increased by 33% year-over-year in\u00a0Q1 FY25 while net income surged from $0.5 million to $42.8 million. Rapidly rising profit margins are paving the way for a more reasonable valuation, and these financial results come at a time when most cybersecurity firms are struggling. Crowdstrike stands to accelerate revenue growth once headwinds subside. Though, you wouldn\u2019t know the cybersecurity industry had headwinds if you looked at Crowdstrike\u2019s financials.\n\nSezzle (SEZL) A close-up shot of a hand holding a sign that reads \"Buy Now, Pay Later.\"\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSezzle (NASDAQ:SEZL) is a fintech firm that specializes in \u201cBuy Now, Pay Later\u201d services. The stock is already up by roughly 300% year-to-date as its platform experiences robust growth. Revenue increased by 35.5% YOY in the first quarter. Net income more than quadrupled YOY to reach $8.01 million.\n\nThe firm trades at a 36 P/E ratio and is valued at under $500 million. Sezzle recently\u00a0joined the Russell 3000 Index.\u00a0 Sezzle would have to more than 10x to fulfill the S&P 500\u2019s requirements. It\u2019s hard to predict which stocks will 10x within a few years, but strong financials, a low market cap, and a reasonable P/E ratio give this company a chance.\n\nStory continues\n\nSezzle\u2019s\u00a0number of total subscribers surged from 142,000 in Q1 2023 to 371,000 in this most recent quarter. The total number of transactions is up by 45.9% YOY. The average quarterly purchase frequency per customer is up by roughly 50% YOY.\n\nCommvault Systems (CVLT) An image of a robot reaching toward a laptop, surrounded by chat bubbles and graphs\n\nSource: klyaksun/Shutterstock\n\nCommvault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) is in the right industry. It\u2019s also got a $5 billion market cap and a 31 P/E ratio. The cloud security company helps businesses manage their digital resources from one dashboard and keep hackers out of their databases.\n\nThe firm\u00a0wrapped up fiscal 2024 with 10% YOY revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue growth for the entire year came in at 7% YOY. Commvault Systems needs higher revenue growth numbers to support a 10x stock price before 2030. However, net income and profit margins are rising. Commvault also has $770 million in total annual recurring revenue. That\u2019s a 16% YOY improvement.\n\nAlthough revenue acceleration is pivotal, the stock already has momentum on its side. Commvault Systems stock is up by 50% year-to-date.

The company launched an AI ad targeting for WhatsApp and integrates AI tools to create an ad that runs on Instagram or Facebook.\n\nReports also indicated Meta\u2019s plans to leverage public social media content from Europe to train its generative artificial intelligence models, drawing protests from privacy advocacy groups.\n\nStock splits lower the price per share, making shares more accessible to retail investors and employees.\n\nThis could make companies like Meta more attractive candidates for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nNvidia Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent 10-for-1 split, which boosted its stock by 28%, has renewed focus on the practice, with Bank of America analysts predicting more splits in the tech sector.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America recently identified potential candidates for stock splits, including Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX), Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI), KLA Corp (NASDAQ:KLAC), and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).\n\nPrice Action: META shares are trading higher by 0.66% at $505.90 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Is Meta Next For A Stock Split?

        "content": "Three equities stand out among the constantly shifting market trends as possible candidates for top stocks to sell. Even though each has seen some success in the past, current events point to alarming market and financial weaknesses that might cause their stock prices to decline significantly. First, we need help with the constant rise in energy expenses related to Bitcoin mining. Even with improvements in operational efficiency, the significant costs associated with energy use pose a risk to profitability.\n\nMeanwhile, the environment for the second one could be better, especially in embedded and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. Its revenue is\u00a0mostly derived\u00a0from the erratic smartphone industry, which has slow growth in these areas.\n\nLastly, the third equity faces a troubling trend of shrinking gross margins and significant dependence on a handful of key clients. Any decision by these crucial clients to reduce their orders could lead to income fluctuations, highlighting the risks associated with this dependence. It\u2019s time for investors to reassess their holdings with these stocks to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarathon Digital (MARA) In this photo illustration the Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) incurs large energy expenditures for Bitcoin mining, even with advances in operational efficiency. High energy expenses may threaten Marathon\u2019s profitability if energy prices keep rising or the business has operational inefficiencies. Compared to Q4 2022, hosting and energy expenditures jumped from $30 million to $75 million in Q4 2023. Depreciation and amortization added to the total cost of sales, which increased to $146 million in Q4, highlighting the high costs related to energy use.\n\nMoreover, with the potential to raise an\u00a0additional $1.5 billion through a new shelf registration for at-the-market stock issues, the business raised $489.3 million through equity sales in 2024. Marathon Digital\u2019s expansion and day-to-day costs rely on debt and equity funding. However, Marathon\u00a0reduced debt 56% exchanging convertible notes for stock.\n\nIn short, this funding might give businesses the money they need to expand. However, relying too much on debt or equity financing could result in higher financial leverage or a diluting effect.\n\nArm (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe IoT/embedded industry accounts for a sizable fraction of Arm\u2019s (NASDAQ:ARM) revenue and reported flat year-over-year growth. The market is still adjusting to last year\u2019s inventory adjustments. However, the absence of growth indicates that there may be market saturation or limited room for expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Arm is primarily dependent on royalties. Royalties\u00a0brought in\u00a0$470 million in fiscal Q3 2024, or 57% of its income. Even though royalties have increased in a stable pattern, the company\u2019s top line is susceptible to outside macro influences. That includes shifts in consumer tastes, market volatility and disruptions in the semiconductor sector. Suppose Arm doesn\u2019t boost the top line from other sources, such as licensing and services or diversify it to lessen its dependency on royalties. In that case, its fundamental ability to grow may be limited.\n\nFinally, the smartphone industry, which accounts for around\u00a035% of Arm\u2019s overall royalty revenue, substantially impacts the company\u2019s royalty revenue. Even though the company\u2019s market has recovered, royalty revenue has increased significantly annually as smartphone sales have rebounded. However, due to its excessive reliance on one market segment, Arm remains exposed to risks related to changes in smartphone demand.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the quarters, Super Micro Computer\u2019s (NASDAQ:SMCI) gross margin has been dropping. The gross margin for Q2 2024 was 15.4%. In contrast, the gross margin in Q1 2024 was higher at 16.7% and 18.7% in Q2 2023. Rather than being a singular incident, the drop in gross margin represents a persistent tendency. The decline in gross margin from the prior quarter suggests its ability to sustain profitability still needs improvement.\n\nMoreover, two current large data center clients accounted for 26% and 11% of total sales in Q2. This suggests that a sizable amount of Super Micro\u2019s revenue comes from these important clients. Hence, these important clients may reduce purchases or find other suppliers. The company\u2019s reliance on a limited number of clients puts it at risk of revenue instability.\n\nLastly, $2.15 billion, 59% of Q2 revenues, came from the original equipment manufacturer appliance and data center sectors. Further, the enterprise/channel vertical accounted for 40% of revenues with a $1.48 billion contribution. Overall, this indicates that these two verticals account for a sizable percentage of Super Micro\u2019s income.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Stock Split Watch: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now That Look Ready to Split",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom promises to create fortune-building opportunities for forward-thinking investors. Key providers of AI infrastructure and applications could be particularly attractive investments as they're likely to benefit disproportionately from the tech industry's growth.\n\nAI leaders that enact forward stock splits could receive an additional boost. Splits may not change the fundamental value of a business, but investors view them as a vote of confidence from management on the company's prospects. Stocks that split tend to be performing well and often go on to set new highs.\n\nIf you're looking to buy some top-quality AI stocks that could choose to split their stocks in the near future, read on.\n\nPotential stock split No. 1: Super Micro Computer\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) state-of-the-art semiconductor technology has helped to usher in the AI explosion. The chipmaker's stock price, in turn, has soared. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) supplies high-performance servers and data storage systems that go hand in hand with Nvidia's massively popular AI chips -- and its shares have performed even better than the tech giant's so far this year. SMCI Chart\n\nThe company -- known as Supermicro -- grew at a blistering pace in its most recent quarter. Sales for the period ended March 31 rocketed 201% year over year to $3.9 billion. Earnings per share increased an even more impressive 329% to $6.56.\n\nSupermicro's close ties to Nvidia and rapid pace of innovation are enabling the AI hardware manufacturer to outpace its competitors. Supermicro was fast to market with its liquid-cooled AI SuperClusters for Nvidia's new Blackwell AI computing platform. The easily scalable data center systems help to accelerate AI model training and inference while also reducing energy costs.\n\n\"Supermicro has designed cutting-edge Nvidia accelerated computing and networking solutions, enabling the trillion-dollar global data centers to be optimized for the era of AI,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a press release announcing Supermicro's new SuperClusters on June 4.\n\nConsidering its sterling recent operating performance and tantalizing growth potential, you'd think that Supermicro's shares would be trading near all-time highs. Yet that's not the case today. Its previously high-flying stock price has pulled back as of late and now sits about 37% off from its 52-week highs.\n\nTherein lies your opportunity. Supermicro's stock can now be had for less than 23 times its projected profits in 2025. That's an attractive price for an AI star that's forecast to increase its earnings by 62% annually over the next half-decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, with its share price standing at nearly $800, Supermicro might soon decide to split its stock to make it more affordable for everyday investors. This could help spark a rally in its stock price that sends it back higher.\n\nPotential stock split No. 2: Palo Alto Networks\n\nIn addition to high-performance hardware, cybersecurity is a vital component of any effective AI strategy. Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) is a leading provider of crucial cloud security services, and AI is set to fuel its growth.\n\nAI demands data. Protecting that data is of paramount importance. Failure to do so could result in loss of customer trust, massive regulatory fines, and other costly financial penalties.\n\nIn turn, global demand for cybersecurity solutions will reach $500 billion by the end of the decade, according to Grand View Research. Consulting giant McKinsey, meanwhile, expects the market for products and services that safeguard the digital economy to eventually grow to a whopping $2 trillion.\n\nPalo Alto Networks is a top dog in this booming industry. It offers a broad array of tools, such as next-generation firewalls and advanced threat prevention services, delivered through a single, consolidated platform. This unified approach helps to reduce complexity and accelerate incident response times for customers.\n\nIts scale is another powerful competitive advantage. With more than 80,000 business customers, the cyber guardian has more data to analyze. That helps its machine learning technology constantly grow smarter. And once its AI-powered platform detects a new threat, it updates its defenses immediately.\n\nPalo Alto clearly has a promising long-term future. It could also receive a near-term lift from a potential stock split. Like Supermicro, its shares are trading at a relatively lofty price of around $300. The company chose to split its stock back in 2022 to make it more accessible for prospective shareholders. Doing so again today could boost demand for its shares among individual investors, which could help to place its stock price on a path to new highs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this server technology company have returned +0.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. The Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, to which Super Micro belongs, has gained 7.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Super Micro is expected to post earnings of $7.95 per share, indicating a change of +126.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.51 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +99.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $34 indicates a change of +44.6% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Super Micro.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for SMCI _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.3 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +142.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.93 billion and $23.92 billion estimates indicate +109.7% and +60.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +200%. EPS of $6.65 for the same period compares with $1.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.89%. The EPS surprise was +15.05%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Super Micro Computer fair value estimate is US$990 Super Micro Computer's US$769 share price signals that it might be 22% undervalued The US$1,032 analyst price target for SMCI is 4.3% more than our estimate of fair value\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nThe Calculation\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  -US$1.08b US$843.2m US$1.53b US$2.11b US$2.68b US$3.22b US$3.69b US$4.09b US$4.43b US$4.72b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x7 Analyst x5 Analyst x5 Est @ 37.96% Est @ 27.28% Est @ 19.81% Est @ 14.58% Est @ 10.92% Est @ 8.36% Est @ 6.57% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8%  -US$999 US$726 US$1.2k US$1.6k US$1.8k US$2.1k US$2.2k US$2.2k US$2.3k US$2.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15b\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.8%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$4.7b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.8%\u2013 2.4%) = US$90b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$90b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$43b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$58b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$769, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Super Micro Computer as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.168. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings.\n\nWeakness\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "content": "Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock performance over the past year has the attention of investors.\n\nThe company assembles computer servers for sale, many of which are used to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The explosion in demand for these servers helped it become one of the more notable companies (and stocks) in this space. Investors who bought in early have seen massive returns.\n\nThis is especially true of investors who bought in five years ago before the AI hype machine went into overdrive. Supermicro, as it is commonly known, is the latest example of how a critical technological breakthrough can completely transform a company (and its stock).\n\nSupermicro's five-year performance\n\nA $1,000 investment in Supermicro five years ago would be worth an eye-popping $42,460 today. That's an average annual return of 112%!\n\nBut Supermicro has been around longer than five years. The company was formed in 1993 and took 14 years to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in 2007. In 2007, few investors had likely heard of Supermicro. Between the IPO in 2007 and 2019, the stock had its ups and downs, rising about 174%. By the end of 2019, it traded at $24 per share.\n\nThe company (and the stock) began to take off in the 2020s, with Supermicro stock jumping 240% from 2020 to 2022 and finishing the year at $82.10.The parabolic point came in 2023 when investors discovered that AI chips from Nvidia filled its servers. Since the beginning of 2023, the stock is up around 848%! And that's even after a 37% price drop since mid-March!\n\nDespite its stellar stock price gains, the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 45, surprisingly reasonable given the growth stock's price performance.\n\nSupermicro is one of the stars of the current AI craze. The massive gains are a testament to its move from an unknown server company to a hot AI stock. Best of all, investors may not be too late. Strong investor sentiment and a relatively low P/E ratio suggest Supermicro could continue to produce returns the market can get behind.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Better AI Tech Stock: C3.ai vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "C3.ai (NYSE: AI) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) both seem poised to profit from the expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. C3.ai develops AI algorithms that can be plugged into an organization's existing software infrastructure to accelerate and automate specific tasks. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, is a leading producer of dedicated AI servers and server architecture.\n\nHowever, investors have been much more bullish on Supermicro, which rallied more than 2,000% over the past three years. C3.ai's stock declined more than 50% during the same period, and it's still trading nearly 30% below its IPO price. Let's see if Supermicro will remain the better AI tech play than C3.ai for the foreseeable future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy couldn't C3.ai impress its investors?\n\nC3.ai mainly serves large government, industrial, and energy customers. It generates more than 30% of its annual revenue from a joint venture with the energy giant Baker Hughes, but that deal expires in April 2025. It needs to renew that contract with favorable conditions to keep growing over the next few years.\n\nC3.ai's revenue grew 38% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in April 2022) but only rose 6% in fiscal 2023. Its growth cooled off as it faced tough competition and intense macro headwinds that drove many companies to rein in their software spending. To cope with that pressure, C3.ai rolled out more consumption-based plans, which generated less consistent revenue than its subscriptions. That shift throttled its sales throughout fiscal 2023, but its revenue growth accelerated again throughout fiscal 2024 and rose 16% for the full year. Its rising customer engagement rates repeatedly offset the declining average selling prices for its services as it expanded its consumption-based services.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, it expects its revenue to rise in a range 19% to 27% as it gains more federal customers and it rolls out new tools for the generative AI market. That acceleration is promising, but the stock isn't cheap at nearly 10 times this year's sales. It's also unprofitable by both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP measures, and it's been prioritizing the development of its new generative AI tools over meaningfully narrowing its net losses.\n\nIn short, C3.ai's customer concentration issues, lack of profits, and high valuation all likely kept the bulls away as other AI stocks soared over the past year. High interest rates are also casting an unflattering light on C3.ai's biggest weaknesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy can't the bulls get enough of Supermicro?\n\nSupermicro holds a smaller share of the server market than Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, but it mainly produces high-performance liquid-cooled servers that can process complex tasks more efficiently than traditional servers.\n\nThat focus made it an ideal partner for Nvidia, which grants Supermicro access to its top-tier data center GPUs before many of its larger competitors. Supermicro then carved out its own niche by selling dedicated AI servers.\n\nSupermicro's revenue and earnings rose 37% and 115%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June) as the market's insatiable demand for new AI servers quickly outstripped its available supply. As the AI market continues to expand, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to soar 110% and 102%, respectively, in fiscal 2024.\n\nSupermicro now generates more than half of its revenue from AI servers, and that percentage should continue to rise. Bank of America expects Supermicro's share of the dedicated AI server market to climb from 10% to 17% within the next three years as the overall market expands 150%.\n\nIn other words, Supermicro could still have plenty of room to grow before its business matures. However, investors should be aware that Dell, HPE, and other companies are also rolling out new dedicated AI servers to keep pace with Supermicro, and it will likely face pricing pressure and tough year-over-year comparisons over the next few years. But for now, Supermicro's stock still looks surprisingly cheap relative to its growth potential at 22 times forward earnings and 2 times this year's sales.\n\nThe better buy: Supermicro\n\nIt's easy to see why the bulls love Supermicro more than C3.ai: It's growing faster, it faces fewer competitors, it doesn't have customer concentration issues, and its stock is cheaper. It also represents a more direct way to profit from the growth of the AI market. Those core strengths will continue to make Supermicro a better buy than C3.ai.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in C3.ai right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in C3.ai, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and C3.ai wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Beyond Nvidia: 3 Proven Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Split Their Shares in 2024",
        "content": "One of the most notable trends for investors this year is the resurgence in the popularity of stock splits. The ongoing bull market is fueling a rise in stock prices, as evidenced by stock split announcements by Chipotle and Walmart.\n\nHowever, the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is also driving up stock prices, thanks to surging sales and profits. The flag bearer for this trend is Nvidia, which announced a 10-for-1 stock split after its stock price soared 728% since the start of last year (as of market close on Thursday), which coincides with the advent of generative AI.\n\nThe speed at which AI has taken hold has boosted the fortunes of a number of companies, and the resulting share-price increases make them prime candidates for stock splits. Bank of America analyst Jared Woodard noted that many companies begin considering a stock split when their share prices surpasses $500.\n\nA look at a few of the top-performing stocks since the start of 2023 suggests there could be more stock splits ahead over the coming year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Current price around $778\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, is best known for incorporating cutting-edge chips into its state-of-the-art servers, designed to withstand the rigors of AI training and inference. The company offers a variety of servers featuring free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air cooling, with plenty of options for companies operating anywhere along the AI spectrum.\n\nClose-knit partnerships with the major AI chipmakers help Supermicro maintain a steady supply of the most in-demand AI chips to power its servers, and demand has been off the charts. In the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter, Supermicro generated revenue that grew 201% year over year to $3.85 billion, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 308% to $6.65.\n\nThe company is scrambling to expand its facilities to meet this accelerating demand. Management believes it will be able to increase production to $25 billion annually in the coming years.\n\nDuring its 31-year history, Supermicro has never split its shares, but until recently, it hadn't experienced a growth spurt quite like this. Since the start of last year, the stock has soared more than 848%, but the results are even more pronounced when taking a step back.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Supermicro's revenue jumped 799%, while net income has surged more than 2,330%. These results have fueled a stock price that soared 2,980%. Despite its blistering performance, Supermicro stock is surprisingly cheap, selling for just 2x forward sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf growth continues along its current trajectory -- and there's every indication that it will -- Supermicro shares will be out of reach of all but the most affluent investors, save those who have access to fractional shares. That provides the company with an incentive to make its shares more accessible to everyday investors, which would result in a stock split.\n\nMicrosoft: Current price around $425\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is no wallflower, thanks to its ubiquitous Windows PC operating system and Office suite of workplace productivity tools. More recently, however, the company got a jump on the competition for its early moves in the field of generative AI.\n\nMicrosoft's stake in OpenAI gave the company unfettered access to the early stages of this breakthrough technology. This, in turn, resulted in Copilot, the company's suite of AI-powered digital assistants.\n\nThese tools are deeply integrated into a broad cross-section of Microsoft's products and services, and demand for AI has ignited growth for the company's cloud infrastructure service. Revenue from Azure Cloud grew 31% year over year in the first quarter, outpacing both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet's Google Cloud, which grew 17% and 28%, respectively, according to research firm Canalys.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), Microsoft's revenue growth accelerated to 17% year over year, while EPS climbed 20%. During its earnings call, the company noted that AI services contributed seven points of its cloud growth. This shows that AI is having a halo effect on Azure Cloud, increasing adoption.\n\nMicrosoft's track record of growth is undeniable, but recent results have made it the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion and driving its stock price up 77% since the start of last year. The results are even more compelling when viewed over the long term.\n\nOver the past 10 years, revenue has grown 165%, driving net income up 376%. As a result, Microsoft's stock price has surged nearly 918%, with a current price of $425. The stock is a bit pricey at 36 times forward earnings, but given its track record and the vast opportunity ahead, it's worthy of a premium.\n\nThe company hasn't split its shares since 2003, but that was a lifetime ago. Microsoft is currently trading just off a new all-time high, and we're seeing just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the company's AI opportunity.\n\nWith all that as a backdrop, we may finally see another stock split from Microsoft this year.\n\nMeta Platforms: Current price around $494\n\nAfter suffering through a trough in digital ad spending during the downturn, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) stock has come roaring back. The seeds planted during the company's cost-cutting campaign are bearing fruit, and the advertising market is staging a rebound. Meta has a long history of deploying AI in its everyday operations, but the dawn of generative AI has taken that to the next level.\n\nEarlier versions of AI helped Meta choose more relevant content for users on its social media platforms, match up advertising with the right viewer, and tag photos, among other uses. This experience helped the company move quickly to deploy AI more extensively when generative AI came calling.\n\nMeta developed its Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI), now on its third edition. Llama is among the leading AI systems and is available across all the major cloud infrastructure services, which pay Meta for the privilege of offering it on their platforms. This is the first in what are expected to be several new ways Meta will generate revenue from AI.\n\nIn the first quarter, Meta's revenue of $36.4 billion climbed 27% year over year, while its EPS of $4.71 surged 114%. This could be just the beginning as the recovery in digital marketing gains steam. As ad spending gathers momentum, Meta should continue to benefit.\n\nThe company is also working to help advertisers on its platform be more successful. Chief among its offerings is Meta Advantage+, a suite of AI-powered tools that has become \"one of the fastest-growing ad products\" in the company's history.\n\nA test run generated a 35% increase in incremental return on ad spend and a 58% decrease in incremental cost per purchase. Not only are advertisers getting better results, but they're doing so more cost-effectively. These automated tools help simplify the creation of ad campaigns and make them more lucrative, thereby attracting and retaining more advertisers.\n\nSince the start of last year, Meta Platforms stock has surged 310%, but that's not unusual. The past 10 years have marked a lucrative period for Meta and its investors. Revenue has grown by 1,150%, while net income surged 1,460%.\n\nThis has fueled Meta's robust stock price gains of 681%. With a stock price of roughly $494, Meta is less than 6% off its recent new all-time high set in April. Furthermore, the stock is currently selling for just 25 times forward earnings, an attractive price, considering Meta's history.\n\nGiven the company's track record of consistent performance, multiple growth drivers, and the opportunity presented by AI, this could be the year Meta finally embraces a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

That price appreciation qualifies both companies as stock split candidates in 2024. More importantly, it tells investors the companies must be doing something right. That type of outperformance does not happen by accident, and winners tend to keep on winning. Famous investor Peter Lynch once said, \"You want to let the winners run.\"\n\nHere's why Supermicro and Intuit are worthwhile investments whether or not the companies conduct stock splits this year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: The market leader in artificial intelligence servers\n\nSuper Micro Computer builds high-performance servers and storage systems for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its products range from individual devices to full rack-scale solutions. The company sources chips, memory, interconnects, and other hardware from suppliers like Intel and AMD, and it has a particularly close relationship with Nvidia.\n\nSupermicro has differentiated itself through modular product development and internal engineering. Specifically, it creates server building blocks that can rapidly be equipped with cutting-edge chips and hardware, and it handles most design and manufacturing in-house. Those qualities often allow Supermicro to bring new products to market before its peers. Indeed, management anticipates being first to market with computing platforms featuring the latest Nvidia Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nAnother benefit of modular product development is that the server building blocks can be assembled in countless combinations,\u00a0such that Supermicro generally offers a broader selection of server and storage products than its peers. Put differently, the company affords its clients more flexibility in designing custom computing solutions.\n\nSupermicro is by no means the leader in the server space. Dell Technologies holds that title.\u00a0But the company has taken an early lead\u00a0in the artificial intelligence (AI) server market and is quickly gaining market share. Analysts at KeyBanc estimate that the company will account for 23% of AI server sales by the end of 2024, up from 10% at the beginning of the year.\n\nSupermicro reported strong financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31). Revenue increased 200% to $3.8 billion due to particularly strong demand for GPU-accelerated AI platforms, and non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income surged 308% to $6.65 per diluted share. Management also raised its full-year guidance, forecasting revenue to increase 110% at the midpoint, up from 104%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 47% annually over the next three to five years. If we divide that number into its current price-to-earnings ratio of 40.5 times non-GAAP earnings, the result is a very reasonable price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.9. At that price, I think Supermicro is well positioned to outperform the S&P 500 over the next three to five years.\n\nIntuit: An artificial intelligence-driven expert platform\n\nIntuit is the market leader in U.S. tax preparation (TurboTax) and accounting software (QuickBooks). It also owns personal finance platform Credit Karma and marketing platform Mailchimp. Five years ago, Intuit began redefining itself as an artificial intelligence-driven expert platform and doubled down on expanding its small-business ecosystem with adjacent services, like payroll and payment processing.\n\nSince then, Intuit has launched live versions of TurboTax and QuickBooks, letting users engage with tax and bookkeeping experts. The company has also introduced a generative AI assistant (Intuit Assist) that answers tax questions and makes recommendations in TurboTax, surfaces financial insights in QuickBooks, and helps small businesses optimize marketing campaigns in Mailchimp. When appropriate, Intuit Assist also steers users toward assisted and full-service tax preparation and bookkeeping solutions.\n\nIntuit looked strong in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended April 30), beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 12% to $6.7 billion, an acceleration from 7% growth in the prior year. That was due to especially good numbers in the small business and self-employed product category, which includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, and related services. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income increased 11% to $9.88 per diluted share.\n\nManagement also raised its full-year guidance. Revenue is now projected to increase by 13%, up from 11% to 12%, reflecting a more confident outlook across all product categories, especially the small business and self-employed segments. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per share is projected to increase 17%, up from 12% to 14%.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Intuit to grow earnings per share at 17% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation\u00a0of 34.5 times non-GAAP earnings look reasonable. Additionally, shares currently trade at 32.1 times free cash flow, a discount to the three-year average of 37.3 times free cash flow.\n\nIntuit has narrowly lagged the S&P 500 over the last three years, but I think the stock can outperform its current valuation over the next three to five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Next Stage of AI Hype",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence is here to stay. With every new product that leverages AI to improve productivity or bring new capabilities, the skeptics\u2019 case is weakening. Many tech stocks to buy will profit from this seismic shift in technology.\n\nThe main question in the AI race remains: Which companies will reap the benefits? Obviously, semiconductor companies providing chips to support AI and accelerated computing are already profiting. Alongside the chip producers, semiconductor equipment makers like ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) and foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) are also winners.\n\nMakers of AI servers have also joined the AI boom. Indeed, Super Micro Computers (NASDAQ:SMCI) and Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) are among the best-performing tech stocks riding the demand for AI servers higher. However, when it comes to software, the environment has been murkier. There is a fear that AI could disrupt some SAAS companies and diminish their revenues.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStill, there are plenty of tech stocks to buy for the AI hype. These three stocks are bargains and present substantial upside as their AI dominance takes root.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is leading the AI revolution, with its graphic processing units enabling large language model training and inference. Despite the substantial gains over this year, it remains one of the tech stocks to buy for the AI hype. Its dominance in AI chips is almost unassailable, and the stock is a bargain based on historical multiples.\n\nOnce again, Nvidia has proven why it will continue to dominate the AI chip market with over 80% market share. Ahead of the COMPUTEX tech conference in Taipei, it unveiled its new AI chip architecture, Rubin. This comes after the announcement of the Blackwell architecture at its GTC conference in March.\n\nAt this rate of innovation, competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) can barely catch up. Nvidia has stepped up to a one-year product cycle from its historical two to three years. Given its head start, it\u2019s inconceivable that competition will catch up soon.\n\nLastly, earnings are growing faster, supporting the bullish case for the stock. Based on Bank of America estimates, NVDA stock trades at 46 times FY2025 EPS and 33 times FY2026 EPS. They maintain a $1,500 price target, presenting over 20% upside.\n\nHP (HPQ) HP sign with blue sky and autumn leaves as backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAfter reporting earnings on May 30, HP (NYSE:HPQ) soared over 10%. It is a stealth AI play that the market hasn\u2019t caught up to and presents substantial upside. AI PCs will be a growth tailwind, making it one of the best tech stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at the Q2 results, the markets were pleased by the PC and print market recovery. However, the main catalyst going forward will be AI PCs. Canalys believes a major transition from normal to AI-capable PCs has begun. They expect AI-capable PC shipments to exceed 100 million units in 2025, accounting for over 50% of all PC shipments.\n\nHP will tremendously benefit from the demand growth of its AI PC portfolio. In addition to AI-PCs, it\u2019s also launching AI-enabled devices and accessories for gaming, room solutions and advanced workstation solutions. Management has stated that these products will have higher average selling prices and lean toward the premium segment.\n\nDespite the upcoming AI products, HP is still one of the cheapest tech stocks to buy. The market isn\u2019t appreciating the potential revenue upside. At 10 times forward earnings, HPQ stock is a bargain option to participate in the AI hype.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nLately, investors have been dumping software stocks, leading to significant declines for the sector. Questions about how AI might disrupt SaaS have created uncertainty. Unfortunately, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) hasn\u2019t been spared, especially after it lowered Q2 guidance slightly. However, after a 20% selloff, CRM stock is now a cheap way to play AI.\n\nIn the application layer, Salesforce will emerge as an AI winner, making it one of the tech stocks to buy. Today, Salesforce is a top customer relationship management SaaS that serves most large enterprises. Its platform holds the largest repositories of front-office enterprise data and metadata. Moreover, everyday users on the platform are creating petabytes of data.\n\nWith AI, this treasure trove of data can become a valuable asset for enterprises. Salesforce hopes to help customers leverage AI to draw insights from their data. To this end, it has launched data cloud to power AI insights for customers. And with Einstein, it\u2019s giving enterprises predictive capabilities and enabling them to create personalized customer experiences.\n\nWith these AI tailwinds, the post-earnings selloff was overdone even though management lowered Q2 fiscal 2025 guidance. If anything, management maintained their FY2025 guidance of 8% \u2013 9% revenue growth. At 23 times FY2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $9.86 \u2013 $9.94, Salesforce is among the tech stocks to buy for an AI boost.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "There are tens of thousands of stocks to choose from when it comes to investing, so many that investors oftentimes find themselves stuck with choice paralysis. While investors see the same obvious big names flying around news headlines all the time, the most attractive investments are often stocks that are still flying under the radar. Oftentimes, companies like these have largely underappreciated business models that require proper due diligence to discover.\n\nFinding such \u201csleeper\u201d stocks is no easy feat. Oftentimes, by the time most investors catch wind of a strong company, the small window for upside and growth potential is no longer there. In this article, we have done the heavy lifting of sifting through dozens of analyst screeners to handpick companies you may have only faintly heard of. Here are three undervalued sleeper stocks that you definitely should put on your watchlist!\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) United States Air Force Northrop Grumman (NOC) RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft.\n\nSource: viper-zero / Shutterstock.com\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is a leading aerospace and defense contractor best known for its high-profile projects with F-35 fighter jets and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Wall Street analysts are currently eyeing a one-year price target for this stock between an average of $504 to a high of $585. \r\n\r\nA large reason why NOC has flown under the radar recently has been due to recent supply chain issues alongside the long product lifecycle nature of A&D companies. Currently, NOC is at the very beginning of a new set of high-value defense programs including the B-21 Raider and Sentinel missile systems. While the company is seeing a short pullback currently due to inflation and material shortages, these new programs are just the first of NOC\u2019s long-term future growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs a result of the stock\u2019s near 10% drop over the past 6 months, NOC\u2019s valuations are looking more attractive than ever. Not only is NOC\u2019s P/E ratio finally dipping under its sector median of 19.41x, but when looking at its PEG, we see a discount of over 50%! As NOC\u2019s high-growth potential becomes realized by investors, I would recommend everyone to consider this sleeper stock as an under appreciated A&D pick.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NYSE:SMCI) is an informational technology manufacturing company that, despite recent success from AI tailwinds, has largely been overshadowed by the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Nonetheless, analysts still remain optimistic about this company as well, and hold an average one-year price target projection of $1,057.46 representing a 36% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile this company is decently well-known to those involved in the AI and tech space, SMCI doesn\u2019t quite spark the same effect as NVDA just yet. Nonetheless, the company\u2019s Q3 earnings have begun to bring attention to its exemplary financials and developments that may just rival Nvidia soon. Another key overlooked driver for SMCI is the materialization of a collaboration with SiMa.ai and CVEDIA to bring smart city solutions to the edge. This collaboration will no doubt be a key turning point to addressing new market share and bringing sleeping SMCI into the limelight. \r\n\r\nLike any growth company, it\u2019s best to look at SMCI\u2019s PEG, rather than P/E or EV/EBITDA. Currently, SMCI\u2019s PEG ratio of 0.64x is sitting at 48% under the sector median of ~1.25x. So, for investors who still are bullish on the AI pick, SMCI may just be an NVDA alternative that is worth taking a look at.\n\nBuilders FirstSource (BLDR) Builders FirstSource (BLDR) exterior and trademark logo.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Irvine, TX, Builders FirstSource (NASDAQ:BLDR) is focused on everything that involves building a home. From wires and pipes to cabinets and nails, they have it all. While the stock is trading at just below $150 per share, its one-year target estimate of $204.27 offers investors about a 33% upside. Our question is, how exactly will Builders FirstSource achieve this?\n\nLet\u2019s face it. Although interest rates are still relatively high and will never go back down to their historic lows of 2%, there is a housing shortage nationwide. To bridge the gap, the companies over 570 locations are in the perfect position to supply these building materials and jump on this larger macro trend. Now that the company has comfortably situated itself with a merger with BMC Stock Holdings, a company specializing in the distribution of building materials, BLDR has set itself apart as an under appreciated stock that is ready to explode.\n\nOver the five years, the stock has risen by more than 900% over the past 5 years. However, as the stock now sees a strong pullback due to an increase in borrowing costs and the slowing of residential construction, its P/E ratio nearly 50% below its sector median is becoming more and more attractive. As the housing shortage soon becomes a growth catalyst in the future, investors should look toward BLDR as an undervalued sleeper stock getting ready to rebound!\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you\u2019re trying to hone in on which tech stocks to buy this month, you\u2019ve come to the right place. The technology sector continues to carry the stock market higher. In just six months, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tripled its market valuation to $3 trillion and replaced Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second most valuable stock (it recently slipped back to third place).\n\nYet other tech stocks are performing just as good or better than the chipmaker. Software company Dave (NASDAQ:DAVE) has quadrupled in value this year, rising almost 400%. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is up 170%, though that has more to do with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bubbling up again.\n\nWhat it shows, though, is significant profit-making opportunities remain in the sector and the following three tech stocks to buy could be the next to explode higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast year\u2019s tech darling Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is growing slower this year \u2013 but not by much. After tacking on 250% gains in 2023, it is \u201conly\u201d 172% higher this time around. But that\u2019s because SMCI stock slipped 37% below the all-time high it hit in March. Now is the time for the next leg up.\n\nSuper Micro reported fiscal first-quarter results that beat Wall Street\u2019s top and bottom line estimates but didn\u2019t offer blow-the-doors-off guidance for the rest of the year. The stock market sold off its shares because SMCI\u2019s outlook for the fourth quarter said revenue would only triple from last year to as much as $5.8 billion.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is the leading provider of artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized computers, servers, networks, storage solutions and workstations for data centers and other industries. The need for more capacity has hyperscalers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) building new data centers all over the country. There will be no lack of demand for Super Micro\u2019s equipment.\n\nSMCI stock earnings are expected to grow a whopping 62% every year for the next five years yet it trades at a fraction of that growth rate. That makes Super Micro Computer a tech stock to buy now.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCybersecurity expert Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is another discounted tech stock to buy because it also has no end in sight to its growth potential. Like death and taxes, hackers and cybercrime will always be with us in the connected computer age. LexisNexis Risk Solutions says \u201chuman-initiated digital attacks\u201d are up 19% globally from last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet Palo Alto\u2019s stock is only up 1% in 2024. The market is worried that billings growth is slowing. It rose just 3% in the fiscal third quarter to $2.3 billion. But that resulted from the cybersecurity outfit offering program bundling discounts to existing customers.\n\nIt is also benefiting from customers consolidating where they spend their money on security. Rather than numerous different vendors, they are buying more Palo Alto modules under its new, single-platform offering. Particularly with the growth of AI, the cybersecurity leader has new program packages that offer superior protection.\n\nPalo Alto Network\u2019s lower price gives investors the chance to buy into this tech stock at a discount.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced wafer cleaning technologies and equipment (WFE) supplier ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is another tech stock the market wrongly sold off. Shares are down 38% from its 52-week high though it remains 16% above where it started the year.\n\nPart of the reason for the pullback is ACM\u2019s market is declining, but only through this year. Analysts at Gartner predict the WFE industry will fall 4% this year after a 10% decline in 2023. However, starting in 2025, it will reverse and see 10% growth with significant gains continuing through 2027. It is easy to see why.\n\nDemand for computer chips is growing, especially due to the needs of AI. ACM Research\u2019s equipment is essential because it eliminates contaminants from wafer surfaces at the front end of the chip processing cycle. Chip manufacturers need pristine surfaces before they begin making the wafers.\n\nThe specialized nature of its equipment will be necessary as chip companies face secular growth trends. That should push ACMR stock to new heights in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Super Micro Computer a Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) had a remarkable year, as the stock nearly tripled. However, it's down around 35% from its highs, which some investors may see as a buying opportunity.\n\nSo, should you scoop up the stock now? Or is it down so much for a good reason?\n\nSuper Micro Computer is often compared to a key supplier\n\nSuper Micro Computer (often called Supermicro) is a key supplier in the data center industry and is thriving thanks to increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI). This association caused the stock to increase quickly, but also contributed to its volatility.\n\nSupermicro's business is booming because it specializes in highly customizable servers that can be tailored to workload type and size. As companies rush out to increase their computing power to train AI models, Supermicro is who they turn to.\n\nThis has shown up in Supermicro's financials, as its revenue growth has been astounding. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending March 31), revenue rose 200% year over year to $3.85 billion. However, this figure only increased 5% from Q2's total. Quarterly comparisons are useful when companies aren't exposed to seasonal trends, and investors want to see a much larger jump from Q2 results.\n\nPart of this is because Supermicro is being compared to Nvidia, as the two should see similar benefits. Because Nvidia GPUs are placed in Supermicro servers, it would make sense if the growth was roughly equal, but it's not. In Q1 of fiscal 2025 (ending April 28, a similar time frame to Supermciro's Q3, but not exact), Nvidia's revenue rose 18% quarter over quarter.\n\nWhen a company is constantly being compared to Nvidia, living up to those expectations is hard. However, this can be compensated for by the stock's lower valuation, which has occurred thanks to the significant decline. So, is Super Micro Computer a buy now?\n\nThe stock's valuation doesn't match management's projections\n\nThere's no doubt that Supermicro is a successful business and is cashing in on the AI boom. The question becomes whether the stock's price is worth paying. To determine this, let's compare management's long-term goals to current valuation levels.\n\nManagement's long-term goal for Supermicro is to reach $25 billion in recurring annual revenue across all product lines. Currently, its trailing 12-month revenue total is $11.8 billion. SMCI Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWhile management doesn't give a time frame for its goal of $25 billion in revenue, let's arbitrarily set it at five years. This would require a 16% compound annual growth rate, which seems achievable.\n\nStory continues\n\nAssuming that Supermicro's profit margin remains at 10%, it will produce around $2.5 billion in profits once it achieves its revenue goal.\n\nThis projection sets the stage for determining whether the price you pay today is reasonable. If you utilize today's market capitalization (how much the company is worth) and divide it by its projected profits, you get the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, this is a slight modification of the standard P/E, as it uses profits five years into the future.\n\nAt a $45 billion market cap, Supermicro currently trades at 18 times projected earnings. Historically, Supermicro has traded around 20 times earnings. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nWhen you have to go five years into the future to get the required earnings just to pay almost the same price tag that the stock has historically traded at, it's a tell-tale sign of an overvalued stock.\n\nWhile Supermicro will succeed and grow as a business, the expectations built into the stock are far too high. As a result, I think investors should avoid buying the stock, even if the company will succeed due to the rise of AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy in June for Great Gains",
        "content": "If you\u2019re looking to maximize your returns in June, you should strongly consider growth stocks for your portfolio. So far in 2024, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 are up over 12%, demonstrating that there\u2019s a robust market environment that is conducive to the best growth stocks.\n\nGrowth stocks refer to shares in companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to others in the market. These firms typically reinvest their earnings back into the business rather than paying dividends. Instead, the focus is on expanding market share, developing new products or entering new markets.\n\nThe recent success in the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 creates an opportune moment to find growth stocks to buy. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, in particular, includes many prominent growth companies that have significant earnings momentum.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe are using the Portfolio Grader to identify the best growth stocks to buy, based on earnings performance, growth, momentum and analyst sentiment. Each of these outstanding equities gets an \u201cA\u201d or a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader and should not be ignored by investors seeking growth.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft (MSFT) sign outside of office building\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for consistency and long-term performance in a growth stock, it would be hard to top Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nThe software company\u2019s package of office products \u2014 Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams \u2014 are must-own products for businesses and individual users.\n\nMicrosoft is now the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company publicly traded company in the world, valued at $3.15 trillion.\n\nIt used its $13 billion investment in OpenAI to bring generative AI to everyday use through ChatGPT, incorporating it into its products like Edge and Bing.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no indications that Microsoft is going to slow down. CEO Satya Nadella told\u00a0Fortune that his company must \u201cstay humble, stay hungry, and exhibit a growth mindset.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s new\u00a0Surface model laptops could be a big part of that strategy. The company says the Surface are the \u201cultimate Copilot+ PCs, delivering incredible performance and brand-new AI experiences.\u201d\n\nIf Microsoft can revolutionize the computer/hardware industry as much as it has the software industry, there\u2019s no telling how high MSFT stock could climb. It\u2019s not out of the question that it could touch $500 per share.\n\nMicrosoft stock is up 12% this year and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Microsoft is the most valuable company, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is newly minted as No. 2 on the list. The semiconductor company has now topped $3 trillion in market cap and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it surpass Microsoft by the end of the summer.\n\nNvidia\u2019s mammoth run \u2014 the stock is up 212% in the last 12 months \u2014 is fueled by generative AI as well. Nvidia makes the powerful graphics processing units that are required to operate machine learning and generative AI applications, and has a mammoth market share of that business.\n\nAnd the business is just getting bigger. Elon Musk is creating a generative AI startup, xAI, to compete with OpenAI, and he reportedly plans to buy 100,000 of Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPUs to power his business. Each of those H100 GPUs could cost $40,000, so the purchase order would be roughly $4 billion, for one company.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget that Nvidia declared a 10-for-1 stock split effective at the end of the business day June 7, so when the market opens on June 10, NVDA shares will be priced at $120 instead of $1,200. That\u2019s much more appealing to retail investors and should give the stock yet another boost.\n\nNVDA stock is up 147% in 2024 and gets and \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) A photo of someone typing on a computer whose browser is open to Alphabet's Google search page.\n\nSource: Castleski / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ;GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another blue-chip name that\u2019s a great growth stock. Its search engine, Google, has roughly 90% of global search traffic.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chrome browser and YouTube platform add to the company\u2019s mighty portfolio that brought in $80.5 billion in the first quarter. The majority of that was the result of advertising revenue.\n\nWhile Bing is powered by ChatGPT, Alphabet isn\u2019t sitting still. The company is working to improve its Gemini generative AI product and allow it to do everything from captioning photos and videos to generating artwork.\n\nAnd this is a stock that has plenty of momentum. After a lackluster second half of 2023, GOOG stock is up 32% since March as investors have shaken off fears that the company could lose market share in its lucrative search engine business. I\u2019m expecting the stock to continue to increase to the $200 mark.\n\nGOOG stock gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is an innovative AI company that makes voice recognition products that are powered by AI. The company\u2019s platform allows users to ask questions about vehicle maintenance and provides step-by-step interactive training for employees.\n\nSoundHound\u2019s platform is also used by restaurants to automate food ordering. Through its Dynamic Interaction platform, customers can verbally place complicated orders at a kiosk and pay without the intervention of an employee.\n\nShares of SOUN stock really took off earlier this year when Nvidia disclosed that it invested $3.7 million in the company, taking a 0.6% stake.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $11.6 million, up 73% for the fast-growing company. And while the company hasn\u2019t yet posted a profit, it has dynamic potential \u2014 its subscription and booking backlog was $682 million, up 80% from just a year ago.\n\nSOUN stock is up 134% this year and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere may be some who believe that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) grew too much, too fast in the last year. The stock is up 258% in the last year, but pulled back dramatically since April, falling from $1,188 to around $800 at the time of this writing.\n\nBut I\u2019m not bailing out on this one. I think Supermicro has a lot of juice left in it, and the success of companies like Nvidia and the AI craze have a lot to do with it.\n\nSupermicro designs and manufactures server architecture and hardware that is essential to cluster Nvidia\u2019s GPUs so they can perform generative AI tasks. That\u2019s why the company\u2019s sales have tripled from a year ago, and why Supermicro increased its guidance from $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion previously, to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion currently.\n\nBernstein analysts project that Big Tech capital expenditures could total\u00a0$200 billion this year, with much of this figure going into the build out of AI capability. Supermicro will get a healthy percentage of that kind of business.\n\nEven with the recent pullback, SMCI stock is up 180% in 2024. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) famously changed its name from Facebook in 2021 in order to focus its attention on CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of the future \u2014 the metaverse. But it\u2019s been a return to the company\u2019s core values that really triggered growth in META stock over the last year.\n\nAfter struggling through 2022 and spending tens of billions of dollars on the metaverse, Zuckerberg wisely reduced spending and staff to reorient the business on profitability. While the metaverse is still an aspiration, Meta is doing a much better job in 2023 and 2024 on improving its core assets and bringing value to META stock.\n\nIts using AI wisely \u2014 to create interesting generative AI products that improve the user experience for Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp. AI also helps the advertising platform to efficiently get targeted messages to the users who are most likely to interact with them.\n\nMeta is looking to do more, including reportedly\u00a0looking to form deals with media publishers to access to content for use in training its large-language models. Meta may also be making strides with its move into AI video generation software.\n\nI would not be surprised to see META shares at $600 within a year. The stock is up 39% this year and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInnovative Eyewear (LUCY) Smart glasses.

LUCY stock\n\nSource: tete_escape / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrue, there are a lot of blue-chip names on this list of growth stocks. But it\u2019s also worth taking a look at a smaller name like Innovative Eyewear (NASDAQ:LUCY), whose shares are still priced at less than $1 and sports only a market cap of $17 million.\n\nInnovative Eyewear makes smart glasses \u2014 eyeglass frames that can incorporate wearable technology. Powered by ChatGPT, the company\u2019s Lucyd glasses responds to voice commands to play music, take phone calls, or respond to queries.\n\nThe company launched a partnership with Eddie Bauer devices that includes four distinct styles that feature polarized sunglasses lenses and the first sale of smart glasses without rims.\n\nLUCY stock is up 81% this year and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis\u00a0Navellier had long positions in MSFT, NVDA and SMCI. He did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had long positions in NVDA and SMCI.

        "content": "If you\u2019re looking for the best growth stocks to buy and hold through 2030, you should look into the many solid businesses other than the top tech mega-caps. I believe expanding your core growth holdings into some of these quality businesses is a good idea, as they have sticky revenues and solid growth over the coming years.\n\nGrowth stocks have been driving the market recently, and that is unlikely to change anytime soon. These companies have solid growth that should allow them to beat the market over the long run. That said, profitability will make or break companies, and the ones I will be discussing today have plenty, or at least are expected to, in the near future.\n\nConstellation Software (CNSWF) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nConstellation Software (OTCMKTS:CNSWF) provides software and services to select public and private sector markets. This Canadian software powerhouse has been a compounding machine for years, making it one of the most reliable and influential stocks in the nation\u2019s tech sector. I believe this stock is poised to rapidly rebound from any dip given its rock-solid fundamentals. This company is also far more geographically diversified than you\u2019d think.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Constellation software revenue by country\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIn Q4, revenue surged 26% year-over-year to $2.35 billion. For the full year, sales skyrocketed 27% to $8.41 billion. Analysts expect this momentum to persist, with revenue projected to double within the next four years at a roughly 20% annual growth clip.\n\nYet astoundingly, CSU trades at a mere six times sales. For a software juggernaut of this caliber, that\u2019s an absolute steal.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

The company is riding high on the AI revolution, delivering record-breaking results in Q3, with revenue surging 200% YOY to $3.85 billion and non-GAAP EPS skyrocketing 308% to $6.65.\n\nI believe the debate around an AI bubble is valid, but SMCI\u2019s fundamentals suggest it\u2019s a compelling buy in the space. The company is investing significantly in production, operations and liquid cooling technology to meet the soaring demand for its rack-scale AI solutions. Despite the stock\u2019s meteoric rise, SMCI trades at just 34 times forward earnings and three times sales, a bargain compared to many frothier AI plays. Growth Stocks: SMCI Revenue EPS\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI expect SMCI to handily double its sales and EPS over the next two years as it capitalizes on the AI megatrend. With a pristine balance sheet bolstered by a recent $3.28 billion capital raise, SMCI has the firepower to scale aggressively. For growth investors, I recommend accumulating shares on any dips, as this AI juggernaut is just getting started.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) operates a leading demand-side platform for digital advertising. I believe this is one of the highest-quality growth stocks you can buy and hold until 2030.\n\nIn Q1, revenue surged 28% YOY to $491 million, highlighting the rapid adoption of programmatic advertising. CEO Jeff Green noted that over 90% of the top 200 global advertisers have run campaigns on their platform in the last 12 months.\n\nCTV continues to be their fastest-growing channel as industry giants like Disney (NYSE:DIS), NBCU, and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) double down on streaming. The open internet is being replumbed and revalued, especially compared to walled gardens. Trade Desk\u2019s Kokai platform helps clients fully leverage data-driven buying to fuel their growth in this environment.\n\nWith the shift to digital advertising accelerating and the $1 trillion TAM up for grabs, I\u2019m incredibly bullish on Trade Desk\u2019s ability to outperform over the long run. The future looks very bright here, too.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a high-conviction growth stock, Trade Desk absolutely belongs in your portfolio.\n\nPinduoduo Holdings (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

I believe PDD is one of the most compelling growth stocks to buy and hold until 2030. In Q1, PDD\u2019s revenue surged an astounding 131% YOY to $11.99 billion, blowing away estimates by $1.41 billion.\n\nThis momentum is undeniable. PDD is a rare Chinese company that successfully brought its model to the U.S. through its Temu app, which has consistently ranked as the most downloaded shopping app. Temu is rapidly popularizing Chinese-style bargain e-commerce stateside.\n\nWhile most Chinese stocks have been shattered, PDD\u2019s international expansion gives it a major edge to keep compounding. Management\u2019s focus on supporting high-quality consumption, broadening supply, and promoting a robust ecosystem positions PDD for sustainable growth.\n\nYes, near-term challenges may arise as PDD invests heavily in the future. But I\u2019m confident its long-term orientation will handsomely reward patient investors. PDD\u2019s unique domestic dominance and international momentum mix make it a top pick. Analysts think it can cross $200 within the next 12 months. PDD price targets\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHarrow (HROW) Light blue pills on white background.

However, I believe Harrow\u2019s long-term prospects are compelling, supported by the increasing prevalence of eye problems in today\u2019s screen-obsessed world. Kids are growing up with screens glued to their hands, and while there\u2019s a lot of debate around why so many people have eye problems today, I think everyone can agree that screens are involved in some form. HROW stock seems like a solid way to benefit from this.\n\nThe company posted strong revenue growth of 33% YOY, reaching $34.6 million in Q1 2024. While Harrow missed EPS estimates by $0.17 with a loss of 38 cents, the launch of VEVYE, its flagship dry eye treatment, is showing promising early results. New prescriptions are ramping up month-over-month, and the company is now seeing its fifth refill cycle, which is where the true value lies for stockholders.\n\nHarrow is expected to turn profitable next year and significantly grow its profits, with the stock trading at just six times 2027 EPS estimates.

The stock has already recovered 50% year-to-date, and I believe it has further room to run.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is the world\u2019s largest dedicated semiconductor foundry. Despite its impressive rise over the past few years, I believe TSM\u2019s valuation still doesn\u2019t fully reflect its critical role in the global semiconductor supply chain. In Q1 2024, TSM reported revenue of $18.23 billion, up 9.7% YOY, and EPS of $1.38, beating estimates by 6 cents. Advanced technologies (7nm and below) accounted for a whopping 65% of wafer revenue.\n\nWhile geopolitical risks surrounding Taiwan persist, I think the market overestimates their potential impact on TSM. Even if tensions escalate, TSM\u2019s global customer base and expanding U.S. presence provide a buffer. Plus, any disruption would likely hurt fabless chipmakers more than TSM itself. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone has nearly 4x the market cap of TSM right now, and this company won\u2019t function without Taiwan Semiconductor. I also expect Nvidia\u2019s pricing power to start extending into TSMC.\n\nChipmakers will also be able to source from TSM right in the U.S. once its factory in Arizona comes online.\n\nAppFolio (APPF) appfolio website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAppFolio (NASDAQ:AAPF) provides cloud-based property management software solutions. Despite the waves of fear surrounding the real estate industry in recent years, I believe AppFolio is a great long-term investment with solid growth potential. In Q1 2024, AppFolio\u2019s revenue surged 38% YOY to $187 million. The company also improved margins, with a non-GAAP operating margin of 26% and a free cash flow margin of 22%. Plus, rising EPS should lead to even more appreciation in the coming quarters. Appf EPS estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget: AppFolio has been beating EPS estimates significantly. APPF EPS beats\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAppFolio\u2019s differentiation lies in the company using AI to streamline processes like customer onboarding. This has resulted in customers completing data migrations 22% faster while maintaining a great experience. I believe the real estate industry is unlikely to face a massive crash due to limited housing supply and smaller family units. As interest rates eventually come down, demand for houses should accelerate. And I haven\u2019t even talked about the additional demand from legal and illegal migration. Real estate will keep growing in the long run, and so will AppFolio. Definitely one of the growth stocks that could perform well through 2030.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nWhile Nvidia (NVDA) has grabbed the headlines this year \u2014 most recently when its market cap topped $3 trillion \u2014 the AI halo effect has boosted an unlikely industry.\n\nUtilities are typically known as one of the more boring sectors of the market. In a regulated industry whose rate structures are determined by states, power companies aren\u2019t known for big growth. They\u2019re seen as defensive because demand for electricity remains relatively constant through economic cycles.\n\nEnter AI and the nearly insatiable power demand that comes with data centers.\n\n\u201cWith the AI rush emerging here, power companies are the ones selling shovels into this gold rush,\u201d Sophie Karp, KeyBanc equity analyst, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe S&P 500 Utility Index has rallied more than 10% this year, behind only Communications Services and Information Technology. Texas power company Vistra (VST) has led the way, more than doubling and following only Nvidia (NVDA) itself and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) on the S&P 500 year-to-date leaderboard. Coming in at No. 4 is Constellation Energy (CEG) with a nearly 70% gain.\n\nKarp said that despite those gains, valuations for power companies remain at historically attractive levels as earnings have kept pace.\n\nThere\u2019s one potential circuit-breaker in the story, though \u2014 and that\u2019s power capacity.\n\nCanaccord Genuity\u2019s George Gianarikas raised the issue in a recent note: \u201cWhat we question is how quickly the energy infrastructure to support AI can be built to support the growth aspirations of the data center companies building the infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIf the power companies can somehow provide, expect big things. But if not, Gianarikas wrote, \u201cexpect a period of digestion for AI-related hardware. Something's got to give.\u201d\n\nKarp, for her part, brushed aside these concerns, saying it\u2019s more of a timing issue than a bigger problem. In some regions, she said, capacity is already abundant. In others, more capital investment and time will be needed to bring more power on line.\n\nRegardless, utilities may have another important catalyst coming \u2014 a decline in interest rates. Power stocks tend to trade inversely to yields, so if they go down either before or when the Federal Reserve (finally) starts cutting, that could be yet another hair-blowing wind for the newly sexy sector.\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9 a.m.-11 a.m. ET.

        "content": "Investors are once again piling into the AI trade \u2014 but those looking for a fast return should think twice.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) shares hit a record intraday high this week ahead of its 10-for-1 stock split, while new product announcements have fueled demand for stocks like AMD (AMD), c3.AI (AI), and Super Micro (SMCI).\n\nDespite Wall Street\u2019s unrelenting excitement surrounding the new technology, a reality check may be necessary. I spoke with top business leaders at Bank of America\u2019s global technology conference earlier this week, who are warning of impractical expectations.\n\nNutanix (NTNX) CEO Rajiv Ramaswami told me that while he\u2019s excited about the revolutionary technology, \u201cAI investments have gotten ahead of reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has to be a valid business case \u2026 to justify the cost of AI investments. There's a little bit of a disconnect between those two right now,\u201d Ramaswami said.\n\nThough there are a slew of applications for AI \u2014 from text and video generation to predicting demand for supply chains \u2014 many tech companies have yet to see tangible returns from their AI investments. Meanwhile, building out AI applications, which requires intense computing power, is expensive.\n\n\u201cThere are good use cases. I'm not suggesting there aren't good use cases ... We just need to make sure they're economically viable,\u201d Ramaswami added.\n\nMeanwhile, Pure Storage (PSTG) founder John Colgrove advised that it\u2019s important to maintain a realistic timeline for AI's expected impact on real life. He warns that expectations are \u201coverhyped\u201d in the short-term.\n\n\u201cAI is going to be transformative, but it is going to take a little longer than people think. What they think will happen over the next 10 years is probably going to take 25 years,\" Colgrove said.\n\n\"It's going to happen, but it takes a little longer to build out the infrastructure and to really get the effects everywhere.\u201d\n\nOn the startup front, excitement has already been tempering. Following a massive surge for several quarters in a row, VC deal value for pre-seed and seed-stage AI startups is beginning to decline.\n\nDeal value totaled $122.9 million in the first quarter, down 76% from a peak in the third quarter of 2023, according to the latest data from PitchBook.\n\nThe driving factors are questions surrounding profitability.\n\nFor investors trying to navigate the hype surrounding AI, there are still reasons to increase exposure, even with expectations of a \u201clagged effect,\u201d according State Street\u2019s Michael Arone.\n\nArone told Yahoo Finance that investing in companies \u201claying the groundwork for massive adoption\u201d are the best way to play AI. It's the companies behind data centers, GPUs, software, and cloud services \u2014 those providing the essential tools supporting the AI revolution.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe really need to move from the AI possibilities to the practical implications of AI \u2026 And while there will be a \u201clagged effect\u201d for companies incorporating AI technology into their products, early builders of the infrastructure and the foundation are the winners,\u201d Arone advised.\n\n\u201cThe winners and losers will become more evident as we move forward,\u201d he added.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Investors Should Stay Away From Super Micro Computer Stock",
        "content": "Without Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) breathtaking success story, you probably wouldn\u2019t be thinking about Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) much in 2024. You might have purchased Super Micro Computer stock back in March, when the hype was at its peak. It\u2019s wise to sell now, before the shares decline further in the upcoming months.\n\nFurthermore, Super Micro Computer set high expectations for itself, and now the company has to live up to those expectations. Otherwise, Super Micro Computer shares could lose a lot of value during this year\u2019s second half. It\u2019s just not a favorable risk-to-reward proposition right now, so I definitely don\u2019t recommend investing in Super Micro Computer.\n\nRiding on Nvidia\u2019s Coattails\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a Russell 2000member that was suddenly thrust into the spotlight during the past several quarters. Super Micro Computer\u2019s shareholders can thank Nvidia and the artificial intelligence trend for that.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSince Super Micro Computer sells AI-enabled servers, some traders bought Super Micro Computer stock in March hoping to catch the \u201cnext\u201d Nvidia stock. In April, I warned Super Micro Computer\u2019s overeager investors about rollover risk.\n\nAfter the publication of that article, Super Micro Computer stock did, in fact, continue to gradually roll over. The stock got a quick bump when Nvidia reported its blockbuster results for fiscal 2025\u2019s first quarter, but that bump didn\u2019t last for more than a few days.\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s plenty of room below for the Super Micro Computer share price to continue falling. Value investors should be concerned, as Super Micro Computer has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 46x. That\u2019s substantially higher than the sector median P/E ratio of 30.73x, which itself seems uncomfortably high.\n\nThe Dangerous \u2018Beat-and-Raise\u2019 Game\n\nRecently, MarketWatch observed the \u201cbeat-and-raise game\u201d that Nvidia, Super Micro Computer and other technology firms are playing nowadays. It\u2019s a dangerous game to play, and Super Micro Computer may be setting itself up for failure.\n\nActually, Super Micro Computer didn\u2019t deliver a top-line \u201cbeat-and-raise\u201d in the company\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2024 report. Wall Street called for Super Micro Computer to generate quarterly revenue of $3.99 billion, but company fell short with revenue of $3.85 billion.\n\nSuper Micro Computer did raise its full-year top-line guidance, though. In its second-quarter fiscal 2024 report, Super Micro Computer hiked its revenue guidance for fiscal year 2024 (ending June 30), from $10 billion to $11 billion, to a much higher range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn case that wasn\u2019t enough of a sales guidance hike, Super Micro Computer upped the ante again in its Q3 FY2024 report. Now, Super Micro Computer expects to generate full-year revenue of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion.\n\nThus, over the past two quarterly reports, Super Micro Computer dramatically raised its full-year sales expectations. It looks like the company is trying to play the \u201cbeat-and-raise\u201d game, but without the \u201cbeat\u201d part of the equation. Potentially, it\u2019s a setup for disappointment in the next quarterly earnings-report cycle.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Stock: Not the Best Russell 2000 Pick for 2024\n\nRussell 2000 member Super Micro Computer is now a famous company, but that\u2019s mainly because of the hype surrounding Nvidia and AI. Now, it\u2019s worrisome that Super Micro Computer has an inflated valuation and high full-year revenue expectations.\n\nConsequently, judicious investors should find another Russell 2000 pick besides Super Micro Computer.\n\nThe risk-to-reward balance isn\u2019t favorable, and value-focused stock traders should be seriously concerned about Super Micro Computer. Thus, I\u2019m sticking to my bearish outlook and expect Super Micro Computer stock to continue rolling over in 2024\u2019s second half.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Super Micro Computer Stock?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) investors are sitting on solid gains of 176% in 2024, as shares of the company that's known for manufacturing server and storage products have continued their rampant rise this year following an impressive performance in 2023, when they shot up a whopping 246%. What's more, Super Micro stock is up an impressive 855% since the beginning of 2023.\n\nInvestors may be wondering if they should be buying this high-flying tech stock following such stunning gains in the past year and a half. However, a closer look at the stock's recent performance points toward a sharp pullback, with shares of Super Micro Computer down 34% from the 52-week highs they hit on March 8.\n\nShould investors use this drop to buy more shares of Super Micro in anticipation of more upside, or is it too late to buy this stock? Let's find out.\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock is expected to deliver more upside\n\nSuper Micro carries a 12-month median price target of $1,030, per a consensus of 20 analysts covering the stock, which points toward a 31% upside from current levels. Meanwhile, the Street-high price target of $1,500 indicates that Super Micro stock could jump another 91% from where it is right now.\n\nWhat's more, 70% of the analysts covering Super Micro stock rate it as a buy. That's not surprising, considering the impressive pace at which the company has been growing, as well as the tremendous growth opportunity ahead of it in the server market, especially in artificial intelligence (AI) servers.\n\nSuper Micro's revenue in the first nine months of its ongoing fiscal year 2024 increased 95% year over year to $9.63 billion. Its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings during the same period shot up by 90% to $15.77 per share. This terrific growth in Super Micro's top and bottom lines can be attributed to the need for mounting AI-optimized graphics processing units (GPUs) in server systems.\n\nOn its recent earnings conference call, management pointed out that Super Micro's growth is \"led by AI GPU platforms, which represented more than 50% of revenues with AI GPU customers in both the enterprise and cloud service provider markets.\" It is also worth noting that the demand for Super Micro's server systems is so strong that the company is finding it difficult to make enough of them.\n\nThe good part is that Super Micro is witnessing an improvement in supply chain conditions. At the same time, Super Micro is landing more customers for its air-cooled and liquid-cooled server systems. Again, that's not surprising, as the company has been quick to launch server systems optimized for popular and upcoming AI GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, Super Micro announced servers for Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell GPUs on the very day that Nvidia unveiled its new chip architecture. Such quick product development moves explain why Super Micro will reportedly produce a quarter of Nvidia's Blackwell server systems. Moreover, the company's focus on being quick to the market with new products is expected to help it gain a bigger share of the lucrative server market.\n\nJPMorgan initiated coverage on Super Micro in March this year with an overweight rating. Analyst Samik Chatterjee estimates that Super Micro could control 10% to 15% of the AI server market in fiscal 2027. As a result, the company's revenue could increase at an annual rate of 43% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2027. Based on JPMorgan's growth estimate, Super Micro's fiscal 2027 revenue could hit almost $30 billion (using its fiscal 2023 revenue of $7.1 billion as the base).\n\nSuper Micro's revenue forecast of $14.9 billion for the ongoing fiscal year 2024 suggests that its top line could jump 110% from the previous year at the midpoint. Considering that the AI server market alone is expected to generate $150 billion in revenue in 2027, according to Foxconn, and Super Micro gets half of its revenue from this segment, there is a good chance that it could indeed hit JPMorgan's revenue estimate.\n\nA closer look at the chart indicates that Super Micro's top line is set to inch closer to the $30 billion mark over the next couple of fiscal years. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nEven better, this robust revenue growth is set to supercharge the company's bottom line as well from the ongoing fiscal year's estimate of $23.78 per share. SMCI EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nIn all, there is a good chance that Super Micro stock could start soaring once again following its recent pullback, as the company is sitting on solid catalysts. But is the stock valued attractively enough right now for investors to buy it?\n\nIt may not be too late to buy the stock\n\nEven though Super Micro stock delivered eye-popping gains in the past year, it trades at a relatively attractive 43 times trailing earnings. That multiple is in line with the U.S. technology sector's price-to-earnings ratio of 43. What's more, Super Micro's forward earnings multiple of 21 points toward a big jump in its bottom line.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro stock is undervalued with respect to the growth that it is anticipated to deliver. This is evident from the company's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio), a multiple that tells us how expensive a stock is in comparison to its growth rate. SMCI PEG Ratio Chart\n\nA stock with a PEG ratio of less than 1 is considered undervalued. So, it isn't too late for investors to buy this AI stock yet, as Super Micro could continue soaring thanks to these catalysts discussed. More importantly, its valuation indicates that it is still worth buying.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Got Idle Cash Lying Around? These Passive ETFs Could Be The Place To Park It\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFinding a safe, but profitable place for your idle cash can be challenging. \"The market is going to remain choppy,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, \"There are questions as to: Where are we headed? Where's the economy headed?\"\n\nAmid surging economic headwinds and mounting international tensions, investing in passive ETFs that replicate the performance of indexes can be as safe of an investment as there is. In an era where market unpredictability is the norm, passive ETFs offer a stable, low-cost way to grow wealth.\n\nUnlike actively managed funds, which rely on the expertise of a fund manager to select stocks, passive ETFs simply aim to replicate the holdings of their benchmark index. This results in relatively lower fees as well as surmounting diversification benefits.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is one of the most well-known and widely held ETFs in the market. The ETF replicates the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 Index, which tracks the performance of the 500 largest companies in the U.S.\n\nInterestingly, SPY was the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed in the United States back in 1993, revolutionizing the investment landscape. As of May 30, 2024, the fund's top holdings include some of the most influential and robust companies in the market. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is its largest holding,\u00a0 accounting for 7% of the ETF's portfolio. Other large holdings include Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL, accounting for 6.31% of the fund's total portfolio, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), with a 6.20% weightage.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust boasts impressive returns as well. The ETF's year-to-date return stands at 10.3%, slightly higher than the benchmark index's 9.4% returns. Over the past year, SPY has returned 24%, beating the underlying index's 21.8% returns.\n\nShelton NASDAQ-100 Index Investor\n\nThe Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index Investor (NASDAQ:NASDX), named in the Forbes Advisor's 10 best mutual funds for 2024, is a promising passive ETF investment option. With $1.66 billion in total assets under management, the ETF aims to replicate the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, thereby benefiting from the market movements of tech giants and other key players that are at the forefront of innovation and the U.S. economy.\n\nThe fund invests in tech giants and other influential non-financial companies on the Nasdaq exchange, providing investors with a stake in major market players. Interestingly, the Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index adheres to a policy of investing at least 80% of its total assets in stocks that are constituents of the Nasdaq-100 Index.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ETF's year-to-date return stands at 10.24%, while its one-year return is over 21%. The strong tech sector performance has propelled the Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index's returns over this period, outperforming the overall stock market returns tracked by the S&P 500 index.\n\nVanguard Russell 2000 ETF\n\nThe Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ:VTWO) targets the Russell 2000 Index, which consists of 2,000 small-cap companies. This ETF is ideal for investors looking to capitalize on the growth potential of smaller, potentially more agile companies.\n\nThe Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has approximately $9.35 billion in total assets under management. The fund's largest holdings include Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX).\n\nThe Russell 2000 Index is widely regarded as a barometer for small-cap stocks, known for their potential for high growth. Over the past year, the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF has gained 13.5%, while the benchmark Russell 2000's returns stand at 13.3%.\n\nItching for Higher Returns? Check This out\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks or ETFs... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, Basecamp Alpine Notes offers a target APY of 9% with a term of only three months, making it a powerful short-term cash management tool with incredible flexibility. EquityMultiple has issued 61 Alpine Notes Series and has met all payment and funding obligations with no missed or late interest payments.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying These 3 Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Over the past two years, you couldn\u2019t go wrong investing in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The stock that is today synonymous with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution returned nearly 800% for shareholders since OpenAI\u2018s generative AI chatbot ChatGPT was introduced. Just $1,000 invested in the chipmaker at the time would now be worth $7,866.\n\nBut is Nvidia\u2019s run over? Or more precisely, are there better investment opportunities out there? Some on Wall Street seem to think so. While many hedge fund operators continue to buy the AI chipmaker\u2019s stock, others are cutting their stake. Some even sold off their entire position. The smart money is not holding cash but rather is putting the money to work elsewhere.\n\nBy following these billionaire stock picks, you might be able to stay ahead of where the smart money thinks the better opportunities lie. Here are three stocks hedge funds bought after selling down their Nvidia stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is a growing list of companies adding advertising platforms to generate additional revenue streams. Many of them are simply \u201cme too\u201d efforts to capture the buzz while others are a more natural integration of the business. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) falls into the latter category.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the payments leader will be starting an ad network by mining the data collected from its extensive platform. It could be a massive opportunity because it is able to show advertisers exactly what people are buying. Other platforms like Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) are good because they show marketers what consumers are thinking of purchasing. Others, like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), are only able to offer a scattershot approach to reaching potential customers. Few other than PayPal can offer agencies such granular detail on where shoppers are actually spending their money.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons PayPal stock is a buy at these prices, but the potential ad revenue it can generate seems like a major boost to its top and bottom line.\n\nA number of hedge fund operators like what they see. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment sold 78% of his Nvidia position and bought 888,000 shares of PayPal at an average buy-in price of $64, for about $57 million. Jim Simon\u2019s Renaissance Technologies sold two-thirds of his stake in the chipmaker and bought over 2.1 million PayPal shares, also around $64. With PayPal stock going for $63 per share at the time of this writing, you can get an even better price than these billionaire investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nSwitching AI chipmakers is what Steven Cohen did at Point72 Asset Manager. He sold off more than half of his Nvidia holdings in favor of starting a massive stake in mobile chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). He bought over 470,000 shares at an average price of $1,221 per share, meaning he went from having nothing in Broadcom to a position worth over $632 million. The semiconductor stock is now Cohen\u2019s second-largest position.\n\nAnd why not? Best known for its mobile handset chips, Broadcom recently shifted its focus to data center infrastructure. It began building custom accelerators and found them in high demand among hyper scalers and others.\n\nEarlier this year the chipmaker said it was \u201cevolving a broad portfolio of technologies to extend its leadership in enabling next-generation AI infrastructure.\u201d In particular, it focused on the lowest power accelerators based on open standards to drive the widest adoption of advanced generative AI clusters.\n\nAmong the innovations it was bringing to market include Ethernet switches with unprecedented bandwidth density and efficiency, laser technologies for optical interconnect solutions for AI and machine learning, and low-power, high-efficiency retimers that resend a fresh copy of a signal rather than merely boosting an existing one.\n\nWith Broadcom\u2019s stock up to $1,330, it is more than what Cohen paid but still a bargain for this fast-growing chipmaker.\n\nZoomInfo Technologies (ZI) Illustrative Editorial of ZOOMINFO.COM website homepage. ZOOMINFO logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFamed investment manager Stanley Druckenmiller sold off nearly three-quarters of his Nvidia stake to buy ZoomInfo Technologies (NASDAQ:ZI) instead. His Duquesne Family Office hedge fund bought 5 million shares of the customer acquisition and management software specialist at an average price of $17 a share. He now owns 5.9 million shares worth $94 million.\n\nHowever, the stock tumbled hard last month after ZoomInfo reported first-quarter results that beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line. Its guidance, though, wasn\u2019t as strong as the market wanted despite being within Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing a lot of that with tech stocks lately. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) had a similar market response after beating analyst estimates because its outlook also wasn\u2019t a blow-the-doors-off number.\n\nZoomInfo saw net revenue retention (NRR) or the amount of money existing customers spend with the company, fall to 85% in the quarter. That is because in the current high-interest rate environment, many businesses, especially among the small- and medium-sized companies it specializes in, reined in spending. At the mid-market level, though, ZoomInfo was seeing NRR improvement.\n\nWith the stock now trading at just below $12, the business data specialist offers a 30% discount to Druckenmiller\u2019s buy price. ZoomInfo Technologies says enterprise retention is stabilizing with renewal rates improving year over year for the first time since 2022. It suggests business will resume its upward trajectory shortly.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META, Vistra VST, Super Micro Computer SMCI and Arm Holdings ARM.\n\nA.I. Bull Market: 5 Lessons to Learn\n\nThough investors may have forgotten by now, the 2022 tech bear market was brutal for U.S. equities. The sugar high from government spending led to several adverse factors. Forty-year highs in inflation spurred Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to change the Fed's multi-year (and seemingly never-ending) \"Dovish\" monetary stance to a complete 180-degree turn.\n\nIn an attempt to quell rampant inflation and provide an oasis for the regional banking sector (which was on the brink of failure), Powell hiked interest rates at a dizzying speed. In turn, high-valuation growth stocks got pummeled, and the Nasdaq 100lost a third of its value.\n\nCapitalism to the Rescue in the form of AI Stocks\n\nThough the bear market was brutal for Wall Street, America's history illustrates that bear markets ultimately transform into opportunities for investors wise enough to have liquidity. That's because America's best and brightest minds never stop innovating. In other words, innovation leads to earnings growth, and EPS growth sparks share prices.\n\nChatGPT Launch Changes the Game\n\nThe launch of OpenAI and ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot marked the turning point for the tech sector and the U.S. equities market. Within weeks of its launch, ChatGPT grew like wildfire and became the fastest consumer software app to eclipse the 100-million user mark in history.\n\nThough there are no signs that the AI revolution is slowing, investors should learn lessons from what we have seen thus far -- because history tends to repeat itself.\n\n5 Lessons to Learn from the AI Stock Boom\n\n1. Invest in Leaders, Avoid Laggards\n\nWhen a mega-trend captures the public's interest, it can be easy for investors to be less selective. For example, in the heat of the internet bubble in the late 1990s, investors bid up any stock with a \".com\" in its name. However, over time, the institutional-backed stocks with solid fundamentals and robust earnings growth provide the most sustainable moves. For example, Nvidia, which is up nearly 200% over the past year, has grown EPS at a juicy triple-digit clip for four straight quarters and has deep-pocketed institutional backers like Fidelity.\n\nConversely, unprofitable, non-institutional quality AI companies are dramatically underperforming tech leaders like Meta Platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Look for Companies Selling \"The Picks and Shovels\"\n\nDuring the gold rush, innovative entrepreneurs became rich by selling the picks and shovels rather than searching for the gold itself.\n\nAgain, history repeats itself on Wall Street. Investors are beginning to understand how much energy will be required to run the data centers needed for the AI revolution. Utilities like Vistra are all less obvious ways savvy investors have cashed in on the rush.\n\n3. Trends Tend to Persist\n\nGrowth investing legend William O'Neil once pointed out, \"It is one of the great paradoxes of the stock market that what seems too high usually goes higher, and what seems too low usually goes lower.\" I have found this quote to be accurate. Investors do not need to catch bottoms to be successful. Instead, they can latch on to momentum trades and manage downside risk.Super Micro Computer gained nearly 250% in 2023. However, the stock was far from done. SMCI quadrupled in early 2024 before retreating recently.\n\n4. Valuation is Not a Timing Tool\n\nAn important lesson is that valuation metrics like the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are not a valid timing tool \u2013 especially for innovative growth stocks. While the numerator (price) is known, the denominator (sales) is not known (moving forward).\n\nBecause of this misconception, Zacks Investment Research heavily weights its analysis and ratings based on forward EPS expectations. Amateur investors would probably be surprised to find that NVDA's p/s has actually fallen since mid-2023 despite the massive bull move in the stock.\n\n5. Moving Averages are a Trend Guide\n\nThe 10-week moving average is a fantastic trend guide for intermediate growth investors because institutional investors tend to support stocks at this level if they intend to increase their position. AI play Arm Holdings is a perfect example of the power of the 10-week average. Investors who only held onto the stock when it trended above the 10-week captured much of the gains while avoiding disaster.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEach moment on Wall Street is unique. However, history tends to rhyme when it comes to megatrends.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Reddit stocks continue to prove their relevance. They recently kicked off another major retail trading rally. The Reddit page, WallStreetBets, attracting north of 15.6 million followers, has become a major influencer for high-stakes opportunities. Hence, Reddit is now an unavoidable force, playing a critical role in moving stocks.\n\nIf WallStreetBets zeroes in on a particular stock, it more often than not leads to a buying frenzy, propelling share prices to new heights. It is important to understand that not all Reddit stocks are created equal.\u00a0That said, three stocks are buzzing on WallStreetBets, potentially offering robust gains ahead.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. The company successfully layered OpenAI\u2019s generative AI technology into its timeless software suite. While Microsoft has long been a frontrunner among top tech stocks, generative AI has helped it leapfrog its competition. Hence, it has established itself as a leader in AI software, delighting investors and users alike.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, its cloud-computing arm, in particular, is now turbocharged with AI, serving as another major growth engine. Its most recent quarter showed its intelligent cloud business, including Azure and Windows servers, shot up 21% on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, Azure alone saw a major significant 31% YOY bump, much of which was attributed to its AI capabilities.\n\nThough we\u2019re only at the dawn of AI\u2019s capabilities, the company is poised to reap substantial long-term benefits. This cautious yet forward-thinking approach underscores the firm\u2019s commitment to leading the AI revolution. Therefore, despite its monumental run-up in value last year, analysts expect MSFT to continue adding new chapters to its illustrious growth story.\n\nLululemon (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nLululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) is a forerunner in the athletic apparel space, known for its high-quality yoga leggings. Its strategic focus on yoga wear has enabled it to build a robust foundation for long-term expansion. Moreover, with the brand evolving, it has broadened its offerings to cover a variety of fitness and lifestyle categories, including running, training and even casual wear. Its diversification demonstrates the brand\u2019s agility and commitment to adding greater depth to its product line.\n\nRecent trends, though, have weighed down the athleisure segment\u2019s prospects. Also, analysts are skeptical about Lululemon\u2019s competitive positioning amidst shifting consumer tastes and spending habits. Despite the validity of those concerns, the firm\u2019s operational results have held up well as it continues to post double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Its profitability metrics are a peach, attracting a perfect 10/10 rating from Gurufucus.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street\u2019s consensus estimates also point to a healthy 40% upside from current prices, assigning LULU stock a \u2018moderate buy\u2019 rating.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) continues to dominate the tech world, seamlessly pairing with the top AI chipmakers, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), among others. Hence, its servers are positioned at the cusp of cutting-edge AI and cloud computing workloads.\n\nRecent results have been remarkable, with revenues tripling on demand for AI servers in its most recent quarter. Revenues shot up a staggering 200% on a YOY basis, reaching a whopping $3.85 billion. Also, its EPS was at an eye-catching $6.65, beating estimates by $1.08. These metrics underscore a strong growth pattern supported by strategic partnerships and a solid product lineup.\n\nAdditionally, with a record-breaking backlog, the company is strategically positioned to leverage price increases and tech upgrades. This could propel its revenue growth even further this year. Moreover, as the tech landscape continues to evolve, Super Micro will be a key needle-mover in the proliferation of data centers and cloud infrastructure.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "SMCI Buy Alert: Why Analysts Think Super Micro Computer Stock Could Soar 40%",
        "content": "Despite some recent volatility, the long-term growth story at Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) remains intact. Twelve months ago, Super Micro Computer stock was $230 a share. Since then, the stock has risen 241% and grown from a small-cap security to being added to the S&P 500, and leading that benchmark index in terms of performance.\n\nMost of the gain came this year,Super Micro Computer stock is up 175% since January. After peaking in mid-March, SMCI stock has experienced some volatility and dropped 36% from its 52-week high. Investors should see the pullback as a buying opportunity and take a position before the share price begins to run higher once again.\n\nPost-Earnings Volatility\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock really took off after the company signed a deal to supply Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with servers that can be used in tandem with its microchips and semiconductors to run artificial intelligence applications.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nServers are in high demand as companies invest in infrastructure to support generative AI applications and models. The huge run up in SMCI stock over the past year has been due to sky high expectations for sales growth of its servers.\n\nHeading into Super Micro Computer\u2019s first quarter print, expectations might have been set too high for the company.\n\nDespite beating Wall Street\u2019s profit forecast, reporting 200% year-over-year revenue growth, and raising its forward guidance, SMCI stock fell more than 10%.\n\nHad any other company posted as strong a quarter, their stock would have skyrocketed. But investors wanted more from Super Micro Computer after the huge run up in its share price.\n\nBig Growth\n\nSuper Micro Computer reported EPS of $6.65 compared to $5.78 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $3.85 billion, which narrowly missed the $3.95 billion consensus forecast of analysts.\n\nDespite the miss, the company\u2019s revenue was up 200% year over year. In the previous fourth quarter of 2023, Super Micro Computer reported 103% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nSuper Micro Computer said its Q1 growth would have been greater had it not been for the shortage of a key component needed to make its in-demand servers.\n\nManagement said that their supply chain should be better moving forward. In terms of guidance, the company said it expects fiscal 2024 revenue of $14.70 billion to $15.10 billion, up from a previous outlook of $14.30 billion to $14.70 billion.\n\nThe new guidance implies astounding year-over-year revenue growth of 582% at the midpoint. Analysts had expected fiscal 2024 revenue of $14.60 billion, which is lower than the revised outlook provided by the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuy Super Micro Computer Stock\n\nThe 10 professional analysts who cover SMCI stock currently have a median price target on it of $1,097.78, which implies 40% upside from current levels. There are currently no \u201csell ratings\u201d on the stock.\n\nThe fact that the company\u2019s share price fell after its Q1 print obscured the fact that Super Micro Computer is growing at breakneck speed, a fact that justifies both its share price and valuation. With demand for its servers rising and the AI revolution in full-swing, Super Micro Computer stock is a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "Super Micro rides the AI wave to a Fortune 500 debut",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer spent over 30 years in one of the least sexy segments of the tech landscape: building high-performance servers. But lately the company has caught the broader AI wave, and it\u2019s now plenty sexy.\n\nIn the past five years, Super Micro\u2019s shares have soared an astounding 3,454%. And over that time its annual fiscal revenue has doubled to $7.12 billion, enough to earn it a Fortune 500 debut at No. 498 this year.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth is being fueled by huge demand for data center servers used for training and operating artificial intelligence models. With more businesses using AI for more tasks, revenue for some server manufacturers is rapidly increasing.\n\nThe truth is that Super Micro has much in common with Nvidia, another company that flew under the radar for years until its AI chips won big in the AI boom and its shares skyrocketed. Both Super Micro and Nvidia were created in 1993, and both continue to be led by their cofounders. The two CEOs, Super Micro\u2019s Charles Liang and Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang, are longtime friends, while the headquarters of their respective companies are just a 15-minute drive from each other across Silicon Valley.\n\n498\n\nSuper Micro Computer's debut rank on the Fortune 500 list.\n\nAnother key ingredient in Super Micro\u2019s secret sauce: It has managed to fill its servers with\u2014you guessed it\u2014Nvidia AI chips, even though Nvidia GPUs have been in short supply industrywide. For now, at least, the close ties between the CEOs seem to help keep the spigot open, despite Liang\u2019s joking command to Huang at a conference in Taiwan last summer: \u201cGive me more chips!\u201d\n\nOf course, Super Micro has had its ups and downs. For example, its latest quarterly revenue, announced in April, fell slightly below analysts\u2019 expectations, and, in reaction, Super Micro\u2019s shares sank 14% in one day. But in that same announcement, Super Micro affirmed that it expects to more than double its revenue year over year in fiscal 2024, to between $14.7\u00a0billion and $15.1\u00a0billion.\n\nUnruffled, Liang voiced optimism that his company\u2019s AI-fueled growth would endure. \u201cSuper Micro is at the forefront of the current AI revolution,\u201d he said during a conference call with investors. He then shot down the idea that the revolution\u2014and his company\u2019s current good fortune\u2014is just a temporary bubble that will eventually deflate, predicting that \u201cAI growth will continue for many quarters, if not many years, to come.\u201d\n\nThis article appears in the June/July 2024 issue of Fortune.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Beyond Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 91% and 154%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) advanced 25% over the past year, and excitement about artificial intelligence (AI) was a major source of momentum. Indeed, AI chipmaker Nvidia alone was responsible for 18% of those gains, according to Morningstar.\n\nThat staggering statistic notwithstanding, there are plenty of opportunities beyond Nvidia. For instance, the following Wall Street analysts see significant upside in Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW), two companies well position to monetize AI.\n\nLoop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has set Super Micro Computer with a price target of $1,500 per share, implying 91% upside from its current price of $784 per share. Morgan Stanley analysts led by Keith Weiss have set Snowflake with a bull-case price target of $345 per share, implying 154% upside from its current price of $136 per share.\n\nInvestors should never put too much confidence in price targets, but Supermicro and Snowflake certainly warrant further consideration. Here are the important details.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs and manufactures computing platforms for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its products include high-performance servers and storage solutions optimized for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In fact, Supermicro is the leading manufacturer of AI servers, due in part to its in-house design capabilities and building-block development strategy.\n\nTo elaborate, because Supermicro can quickly equip its platform building blocks with the latest chips and interconnects from suppliers like Nvidia and Intel, the company is often first-to-market with new technologies. CEO Charles Liang highlighted that advantage on the most recent earnings call. \"We provide optimized AI solutions at scale, offering a time-to-market advantage and shorter lead times over our competition.\"\n\nSupermicro's building-block approach to product development also affords clients a great deal of flexibility in designing custom solutions. Specifically, because its platform building blocks come together in so many different combinations, Supermicro allegedly offers the broadest and deepest portfolio of advanced server and storage solutions in the IT industry.\n\nThe upshot of that advantage is that Supermicro grew revenue about five times faster than the industry average during the last year, meaning it gained substantial market share. In April, Tom Blakely at KeyBanc estimated in April that Supermicro accounted for 10% at the time, but he believes its market share will reach 23% by the end of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 47% annually over the next three to five years. That estimate seems reasonable given that the AI server market is projected to grow at 27% annually through 2029. Assuming Wall Street is correct, the current valuation of 44 times earnings looks rather cheap because it gives a PEG ratio below 1.\n\nInvestors shouldn't count on a 91% return in the next year, but Supermicro shares are reasonably priced and the stock has a good shot at beating the S&P 500 over the next three to five years.\n\n2. Snowflake\n\nSnowflake lets businesses store, transform, and analyze data on a single platform that runs on all three major public clouds. Its platform also features a data sharing marketplace, which creates a network effect that makes Snowflake increasingly valuable to customers as more data is uploaded.\n\nSnowflake is unique in its ability to offer those capabilities on a single platform that spans multiple public clouds, according to Morningstar. That product differentiation means the company is well positioned to benefit as businesses spend more on data analytics, a market forecasted to expand quickly in the coming years. Specifically, sales across data lakes and data warehouses are forecasted to increase at 24% annually through 2030.\n\nSnowflake reported mixed financial results in the first quarter. Its customer count climbed 21% to 9,822 and the average existing customer spent 28% more. In turn, revenue rose 33% to $829 million, but non-GAAP net income dropped 4% to $52 million.\n\nManagement also adjusted its full-year guidance in a somewhat mixed fashion. Revenue growth is now expected to be 24% in fiscal 2025 (ends in January 2025), up from the previous estimate of 22%. But the non-GAAP operating margin is projected to be 3%, down from the previous estimate of 6%.\n\nThe combination of the first-quarter decline in net income and the reduction in full-year margin guidance has investors worried. Snowflake shares have slumped 17% since the company reported earnings on May 22. But management attributes those setbacks to increased GPU expenses related to its artificial intelligence roadmap. Tht means margins should expand as new AI products like Cortex reach scale.\n\nCortex lets users analyze data with large language models and machine learning models designed for tasks like summarization and forecasting. Snowflake is also integrating other generative AI features, such as Snowflake Copilot for coding, Document AI for data extraction, and Universal Search for finding database objects. Cortex became generally available in May, but the other AI features are still in preview, meaning the company has hardly tapped its potential where AI is concerned.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Snowflake to grow sales at 23% annually over the next three years. That estimate seems low given the tremendous demand for data analytics and AI solutions. Nevertheless, even if the consensus estimate on Wall Street is correct, the current valuation of 14.9 times sales seems reasonable. In fact, the stock has never been cheaper.\n\nI doubt Snowflake will produce triple-digit returns over the next year, but investors that buy a small position today could certainly beat the market over the next three to five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Does Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?",
        "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nHow Fast Is Super Micro Computer Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nSuper Micro Computer has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Super Micro Computer's EPS shot up from US$11.13 to US$17.91; a result that's bound to keep shareholders happy. That's a impressive gain of 61%.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Super Micro Computer maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 80% to US$12b. That's a real positive.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Super Micro Computer?\n\nAre Super Micro Computer Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Super Micro Computer has a market capitalisation of US$46b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$6.6b. Coming in at 14% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.\n\nIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Super Micro Computer, the median CEO pay is around US$14m.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe CEO of Super Micro Computer was paid just US$1.0 in total compensation for the year ending June 2023. You could consider this pay as somewhat symbolic, which suggests the CEO does not need a lot of compensation to stay motivated. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\n\nIs Super Micro Computer Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nIf you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Super Micro Computer's strong EPS growth. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes Super Micro Computer look rather interesting indeed. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Super Micro Computer (1 is significant!) that you need to be mindful of.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "The S&P 500, which tracks the stock market performance of the 500 largest U.S. companies, hit a new all-time high this week. This marks the 21st time this year the benchmark has ascended to new heights (as of this writing).\n\nWhile some investors might find this concerning, XM Investment analyst Marios Hadjikyriacos remains bullish: \"Stock markets are enjoying the best of all worlds, buoyed by a resilient U.S. economy and speculation that Fed rate cuts are just around the corner, helping to justify stretched valuations.\" UBS analyst Mark Haefele concurs, positing in a note to investors, \"All-time highs often generate investor concern that markets have peaked. Such worries are not supported by history.\"\n\nIn fact,\u00a0according to select Wall Street analysts, a number of high-profile stocks in the S&P 500 still have a great deal of upside potential and could soar as much as 91%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside of 91%\n\nThe first S&P 500 stock that could continue to soar is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro. The company partners with some of the top chipmakers to incorporate state-of-the-art processors into a suite of high-end servers specially designed to handle the computational rigors of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nUnlike some of its competitors, Supermicro uses a building-block architecture, which allows buyers to customize a system that's right for their needs. The company supplies a wide variety of server solutions focused on energy efficiency, helping defray the cost of AI processing.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 201% year over year to $3.85 billion, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 329% to $6.56. To keep up with soaring demand, Supermicro is building new production facilities and expanding existing ones, bringing its production capacity to $25 billion annually.\n\nWall Street remains remarkably bullish despite the stock rising an incredible 232% over the past year. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah increased his price target on Supermicro to $1,500 while maintaining a buy rating on the shares. That represents a potential upside of 91% compared to Friday's closing price.\n\nBaruah cited Supermicro's leading position in the AI server market and its ability to navigate complexity and scale as reasons for his growing confidence. He also believes that by the end of fiscal 2026, the company will increase its revenue run rate to $40 billion -- a far cry from management's current forecast of roughly $15 billion for fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Supermicro. Of the 16 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in April, 12 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nFurthermore, at just 2 times next year's sales, the stock is cheap compared to many AI stocks.\n\nMicrosoft: Implied upside of 45%\n\nAnother S&P 500 stock with plenty of upside is Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), despite being the largest company in the world when measured by market cap. Microsoft is one of the big three cloud infrastructure platforms and a leading software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider. There is also the company's legacy business, which includes its Windows operating system and Office suite of productivity software.\n\nAmong Microsoft's biggest opportunities is generative AI, which the company has integrated across its product portfolio and offers to its cloud customers. The standard bearer for its efforts is Copilot, Microsoft's generative AI-powered suite of digital assistants.\n\nMost prominent is Microsoft Copilot 365, but the company also has versions focused on developers, finance, sales, and more. The company charges $30 per user per month, and numerous analysts have chimed in, suggesting it could be worth as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue each year.\n\nDuring the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), Microsoft's revenue of $61.9 billion climbed 17% year over year, while EPS of $2.94 jumped 20%.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst believes there's much more to come. Truist analyst Joel Fishbein has a buy rating on Microsoft stock and a three-year price target of $600. This represents potential upside of 45% compared to Friday's closing price.\n\nFishbein cited generative AI, cloud computing, and Copilot as drivers, \"which could propel shares to compounding strong gains,\" resulting in tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue.\u00a0The analyst is part of a growing Wall Street chorus singing Microsoft's praises. Of the 58 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in April, 55 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nAt 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft might seem a bit pricey, but adoption of AI is still growing by leaps and bounds, providing a strong secular tailwind. That, combined with its long track record of performance, shows that it's deserving of a premium.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Wall Street actually largely ignores and tremendously underestimates great stocks fairly frequently. And the phenomenon has become even more widespread than usual over the past few years. That\u2019s because most large investors believe that the vast majority of small and medium companies are in great danger of failing due to today\u2019s relatively high interest rates.\n\nBut today\u2019s interest rates are actually not that high from a historical perspective. And it\u2019s clear that great small-and-medium companies can indeed thrive despite the elevated rates.\n\nAmong the companies in the latter category whose stocks have risen tremendously (after being largely ignored and greatly underestimated by the Street) are Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH), Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI), and Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS). Here are three largely undiscovered stocks that are poised to follow the same path over the longer term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmerican Superconductor (AMSC) a close up image of a semiconductor. 5X Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Superconductor\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMSC) products are used to regulate electrical currents and manage wind turbines. Additionally, the company develops products used by the U.S. Navy to evade and detect mines.\n\nIn-line with my previous predictions, the company reported very strong fiscal fourth-quarter results on May 29. Specifically, its top line jumped to $42 million last quarter versus $31.74 million during the same period a year earlier. Further, its operating activities generated $2.14 million of cash, versus cash burn from operating activities of $22.5 million in Q4 of 2023.\n\nIn my previous assessment of AMSC stock, I predicted that the company would likely benefit from the success of its partner, Indian wind energy developer Inox Wind. That appears to have been the case, as the revenue generated by American Superconductor\u2019s wind unit more than doubled year-over-year to $7.8 million last quarter.\n\nGoing forward, I expect American Superconductor to continue to be boosted by Inox\u2019s strong growth. Moreover, the U.S. firm also obtains a significant amount of its revenue from chipmakers, so it should benefit from the rapid growth of chip manufacturing in America.\n\nFinally, the firm obtains a meaningful amount of its revenue from utilities. With utilities building many new power plants to satisfy the increasing demand for electricity, American Superconductor is well-positioned to get a meaningful lift from the latter phenomenon.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, \u201cSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) provides industrial robots that are autonomous and powered by its proprietary AI software.\u201d The company\u2019s robots are primarily currently used in warehouses, and it has signed up multiple, huge customers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Target (NYSE:TGT) .\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the ongoing labor shortages in the U.S. and the continued enhancements in robots\u2019 capabilities enabled by AI, I predict that Symbotic will grow tremendously going forward.\n\nIndeed, the firm is already delivering strong growth as its sales surged 59% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $424 million. And for the current quarter, the firm expects to generate EBITDA, excluding certain items, of $27 to $29 million. The latter outlook indicates that the company is moving rapidly towards overall profitability.\n\nGiven these points, I view Symbotic as one of the best largely undiscovered stocks to buy at this point.\n\nGE Vernova (GEV) Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.\n\nSource: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nGE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) sells parts used in power plants and electrical grids.

As evidence of that point, consider that Morgan Stanley recently initiated coverage of the name with a lukewarm \u201cequal weight\u201d rating, even though it concedes that the firm will benefit from \u201cgrowing electricity demand, power grid reliability and the need to slash carbon emissions\u201d going forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in AMSC,GEV,CELH, and SMCI.

        "title": "Is Super Micro Computer Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock may have claimed the mantle as the leader of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, but one AI stock has outperformed it. That's Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of high-density servers and storage equipment that, like Nvidia, has seen a surge in demand during the AI boom as its products are well-suited to run demanding AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nAs you can see from the chart below, Supermicro stock has soared since the start of 2023, beating out Nvidia, even though it has pulled back in recent weeks. SMCI Chart\n\nIs Supermicro stock a buy? Below is a look at what the stock has to offer today to answer that question. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhere Supermicro stock stands today\n\nIt's easy to see why Supermicro's stock has skyrocketed over the last 1 1/2 years. Like Nvidia, the company sells computing infrastructure that's in high demand in the AI boom.\n\nThe company's revenue growth has gone parabolic in recent quarters, jumping from just 14% in the fiscal first quarter, which ended in September, to 103% in the December quarter. Next it jumped to 200% in the March quarter -- the fiscal third quarter. Looking ahead, the company expects a revenue surge of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion in the current quarter, representing 143% year-over-year growth and 38% sequential growth at the midpoint.\n\nInvestors shouldn't expect that triple-digit growth rate to last forever, but it's clear that Supermicro is capitalizing on the ramp up in AI infrastructure in a way that competitors like Dell Technologies and HPE aren't yet.\n\nThe company has a number of competitive advantages that have driven its skyrocketing growth and separated it from the competition. Supermicro enjoys a long-standing close relationship with Nvidia. Supermicro's CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia's CEO have been collaborating for more than 30 years, and both are immigrants from Taiwan. That relationship helps Supermicro get preferred access to new chips and components for its servers, and the companies have worked together on custom designs.\n\nSupermicro is known for being faster than the competition to release new products and offers more customization options. It also specializes in high-density servers, which deliver more computing power in less space and are therefore valued for AI applications, which demand large amounts of power.\n\nFinally, Supermicro has also developed liquid cooling solutions, which are becoming increasingly necessary to run AI servers, to help it stay ahead of the competition. Liquid cooling can also help data centers save on energy costs. Supermicro said in its recent earnings call that its liquid cooling technology, along with other features, can help customers save 40% in data center energy costs at scale.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Super Micro Computer stock a buy?\n\nShares of Supermicro are now down roughly 26% from their peak shortly after the company was admitted into the S&P 500. Concerns about a bubble and encroaching competition have spooked some investors, but recent reports from Nvidia and Supermicro show demand for AI hardware is still soaring and outstripping supply, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nGiven the soaring revenue growth at Supermicro, you might expect the stock to be extremely expensive, but its valuation looks reasonable at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) under 40. The company hasn't experienced the same margin expansion that Nvidia has, as it's kept its prices down to capitalize on the opportunity to add new customers and build loyalty, but Supermicro's profits are still growing rapidly.\n\nGenerative AI still seems to be in the early stages of its development, and hardware needs are likely to grow from here. Considering its valuation and rapid growth, Supermicro looks like a smart stock to buy if you're bullish on the AI boom.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Turned $10,000 Into More Than $100,000 in Just 5 Years",
        "content": "You don't need to be rich to make a lot of money on the stock market. While it certainly helps if you can invest larger sums of money, it's possible to generate some life-changing returns with more modest sums. You just need to buy the right stocks. Three stocks that turned a $10,000 investment into $100,000 over the past five years are Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Builders FirstSource (NYSE: BLDR).\n\nHere's a closer look at each one of these businesses, including a discussion about why their shares took off and whether they remain good investments for your portfolio today.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nA $10,000 investment in Supermicro just five years ago would now be worth more than $429,140. The stock surged as investors saw it as a promising artificial intelligence (AI) play. Supermicro provides companies with AI solutions, including servers, which can help train complex artificial intelligence models.\n\nBusiness is booming for Supermicro, and the tech company recently raised its guidance. For its current fiscal year (which ends in June), management expects revenue to come in between $14.7 billion and $15.1 billion (the previous guidance called for revenue between $14.3 billion and $14.7 billion). At the midpoint, that would imply an annual growth rate of 110% (Supermicro generated $7.1 billion in sales in its previous fiscal year).\n\nDespite Supermicro's surging numbers, its share price isn't obscene from a valuation perspective. Investors pay 24 times Supermicro's expected future earnings for a piece of the business. With so much growth still ahead in AI, there could be more gains for investors who buy the stock today.\n\n2. Tesla\n\nTesla's stock has struggled this year. It's trading down 28% since January. However, it has still made for a terrific investment over the past five years. Over that time, a $10,000 investment would have grown to $142,290.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) maker's business continues to grow at a rapid rate. The company more than tripled its revenue from less than $32 billion in 2020 to nearly $97 billion by the end of 2023. Profits also grew, with Tesla reporting a profit margin of 15% in 2023.\n\nTesla does face some challenges ahead, including increased competition from Chinese EV makers and a drop in product demand partially related to macroeconomic conditions. However, Tesla's leadership status in the EV market could still make for a good long-term play. Trading at 46 times its trailing earnings, Tesla is not a cheap stock. But if you're bullish on the EV market, it could make for a much more attractive long-term investment at its current reduced price.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Builders FirstSource\n\nYou don't necessarily need to invest in tech to earn a great return. Builders FirstSource is a solid example of that. Its five-year gains are the lowest among the three stocks, but an investor would still end up with more than $108,660 today if he or she invested $10,000 into the business five years ago.\n\nBuilders FirstSource provides building materials, supplies, and construction services to homebuilders and contractors, and it has benefited from a boom in the housing market in recent years. Like with Tesla, business has slowed somewhat recently for Builders FirstSource as it deals with some challenging macroeconomic conditions.\n\nIn the first three months of the year, net sales totaled just $3.9 billion (essentially flat year over year). And the company's net income of $258.8 million fell by 23% compared to the prior-year quarter. Builders FirstSource management isn't expecting a huge year in 2024 -- it projects sales to total between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion, suggesting just 5% growth at the midpoint.\n\nTrading at a relatively modest 15 times earnings, this is a stock that could be a sleeper pick right now. The housing market is likely to rebound in the long run, and with a strong business, Builders FirstSource could make for an underrated buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

(5:40) - Tracey\u2019s Top Stock Picks For Your Watchlist (23:00) - Episode Roundup: MOD, ETN, GOOGL, MSFT, SMCI Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #371 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nNVIDIA recently reported earnings and the company talked about the \u201cAI revolution.\u201d Stock investors are eager to get into this trade, but the stocks have rallied big over the last year.\n\nIf you\u2019re a value investor, you may be on the sidelines thinking that all of the AI stocks are just too expensive to even consider. But Tracey believes ALL investors should have some exposure to this new industry. However, that doesn\u2019t mean she thinks you need to buy an expensive stock to get it.\n\nTrees don\u2019t grow to the sky and no stock goes higher for forever. Even the mighty NVIDIA has had pullbacks and sell-offs in the last year during its incredible rally. There have been buying opportunities.\n\nValue investors should look for pullbacks and sell-offs in these stocks. They always come.\n\nWhat\u2019s an \u201cAI Stock\u201d?\n\nThere are companies in several different industries that are currently considered \u201cAI stocks.\u201d The most well known is in the chips. NVIDIA has a lock on that market, for now.\n\nBut those chips go into data centers. Companies that are involved in the build-out, or servicing, of the data centers are also \u201cAI stocks.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the companies doing business in generative AI. These are the companies using all that data that is at the data centers.\n\nIt takes a lot of electricity and other utilities, like cooling, to keep the data centers operational so there are \u201cold economy\u201d companies that are now \u201cAI stocks.\u201d\n\nAnd it won\u2019t stop there. The AI industry will expand as the ecosystem builds out. But, for now, these are the most prominent areas to invest in.\n\n5 of the Cheapest AI Stocks to Buy Now\n\n1. Modine Manufacturing (MOD)\n\nModine Manufacturing has been involved in thermal management since 1916. Talk about \u201cold economy.\u201d In fiscal 2024, Modine\u2019s data center business increased 69% year-over-year.\n\nShares of Modine Manufacturing have soared 61% year-to-date but it\u2019s still attractively priced, with a forward P/E of just 27.\n\nShould a mid-cap company like Modine Manufacturing be on your AI stock watch list?\n\n2. Eaton Corp. (ETN)\n\nEaton is in power management. Founded in 1911, it has paid dividends every year since 1923. That\u2019s as \u201cold economy\u201d as you can get.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut shares of Eaton are up 36% year-to-date to new highs as it\u2019s now an AI stock. It\u2019s not cheap, however. Eaton trades with a forward P/E of 32 and a P/S ratio of 5.7.\n\nShould power management companies like Eaton be on your watch list?\n\n3. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is known for advertising and for some of its products like YouTube. It has been deploying generative AI to roll out new products, including on Google Search.\n\nShares of Alphabet are up 21.8% in 2024 to new all-time highs. However, Alphabet remains one of the more attractive AI stocks due to its low P/E. No, Alphabet isn\u2019t trading under 15x earnings, but it\u2019s still attractive at 23x.\n\nCould Alphabet be one of the cheapest of the AI stocks?\n\n4. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft was among the first to roll out generative AI features in its products. As a result, investors have pushed up the stock to new highs. Microsoft shares have gained 7.9% year-to-date, but are off recent highs.\n\nMicrosoft is expensive at these levels. It is trading with a forward P/E of 35. But another indicator of value, its price-to-sales ratio, is also at sky-high levels at 13.5. A P/S ratio over 10 is considered high.\n\nShould Microsoft still be on your watch list at these valuations?\n\n5. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer provides service and storage solutions in cloud and data centers. It\u2019s been one of the hottest AI stocks of the last year. Shares of Super Micro Computer are up 172% year-to-date.\n\nBut shares have pulled back over the last 3 months. Super Micro Computer has fallen 14.6% during that period. And while it trades with a forward P/E of 35, because of its incredible growth, Super Micro Computer has a PEG ratio of just 0.7. A PEG ratio under 1.0 usually indicates a company has both growth and value.\n\nIs this weakness a buying opportunity in Super Micro Computer?\n\nWhat Else Should You Know About Cheap AI Stocks?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT and GOOGL in her personal portfolio.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks.

The Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, to which Super Micro belongs, has gained 5.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSuper Micro is expected to post earnings of $7.95 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +126.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.51 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +99.1%. This estimate has changed -4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $34 indicates a change of +44.6% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +15.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Super Micro is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for SMCI _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.3 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +142.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.93 billion and $23.92 billion estimates indicate +109.7% and +60.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +200%. EPS of $6.65 for the same period compares with $1.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.89%. The EPS surprise was +15.05%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: \u00a0https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2281656/5-hot-stocks-and-their-fibonacci-retracements)\n\n5 Hot Stocks and Their Fibonacci Retracements\n\nWelcome to Episode #403 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\n(1:30) - Using The Fibonacci Retracement To Know When To Buy and Sell Your Investments (12:20) - Top Performing Stocks: Breaking Down The Charts To Find A Possible Buy (29:40)- Episode Roundup: COST, CMG, NVDA, SMCI, GOOGL, VRT Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week Tracey is joined by Zacks Stock Strategist and the editor of Zacks Counterstrike newsletter, Jeremy Mullin, to discuss the Fibonacci retracement levels on a handful of hot stocks as well as the major indexes including the S&P 500, the NASDAQ and the Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), which is the small caps.\n\nFibonacci Retracement Levels Are Another Tool\n\nFibonacci retracement levels look for areas of price resistance and support on stock charts. Jeremy uses Fibonacci retracement levels like a map. There are no guarantees with the retracement levels. Sometimes they hold, and sometimes they do not. And this includes both to the upside and to the downside.\n\nThe retracement levels are meant to be a guideline. But investors and traders can use them as another arsenal in their technical toolbox, in addition to knowing the company's fundamentals.\n\nJeremy and Tracey looked at a bunch of hot stocks that have hit Jeremy's top Fibonacci retracement levels, to see where the sell-off Fibonacci retracement levels could possibly be.\n\nMissed out on the trade? There are always pullbacks and sell offs in stocks. Yes, even NVIDIA has pulled back in the last year.\n\nWhat price should you be looking at for the pullback?\n\n5 Hot Stocks and Their Fibonacci Retracement Levels\n\n1. Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT\n\nVertiv provides infrastructure solutions and services in the areas of data centers, communication networks and commercial and industrial facilities including cooling and power. It is an AI play.\n\nShares of Vertiv have soared 115% year-to-date and are trading near all-time highs. As Jeremy discusses in the podcast, there have been few opportunities to get in on a pull-back on Vertiv so far as the stock has steadily ground higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat are Vertiv's Fibonacci retracement levels?\n\n2. Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI\n\nSuper Micro Computer has been one of the big AI and data center winners of the last year. Sales are expected to jump 109.7% this year.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer have soared 188% year-to-date. But this is an instance where the stock IS pulling back. Super Micro Computer is down 5.5% over the last 3 months.\n\nIs Super Micro Computer closing in on key Fibonacci retracement levels right now?\n\n3. Costco Wholesale Corp. COST\n\nCostco has a cult-like following among both shoppers and stock investors. Sales are expected to rise 4.6% in fiscal 2024.\n\nShares of Costco have been hitting new all-time highs, gaining 23.6% year-to-date. Who dares to buy it at these lofty levels?\n\nJeremy has a Fibonacci retracement level at a much lower price than current levels. Should you be a buyer of Costco if it gets there?\n\n4. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.CMG\n\nChipotle is one of the top restaurant stocks this year. Shares of Chipotle have soared 34% year-to-date to new all-time highs.\n\nChipotle is still doing double digit sales growth as well, with sales expected to rise 15% in 2024. The company is doing a 50-to-1 stock split on June 6, 2024, so keep that in mind when watching Jeremy discuss Fibonacci retracement levels.\n\nWhat are the Fibonacci retracement levels telling us about Chipotle?\n\n5. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nDid you miss out on the pullback in NVIDIA earlier this year? Shares of NVIDIA have skyrocketed, again, after the recent earnings report. The stock is up 28.7% over the last 4 weeks. NVIDIA is up 128% for the year.\n\nSales are expected to soar in fiscal 2025, up 91%.\n\nAll stocks have pullbacks. What are the Fibonacci retracement levels for NVIDIA?\n\nWant to See the Fibonacci Retracement Levels on the Charts?\n\nJeremy shares all the charts and talks all the Fibonacci retracement levels. Tune into this week's video podcast to see them.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\u00a0 https://twitter.com/zacksresearch\n\nJoin us on Facebook:\u00a0 https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\n\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com/performance\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "Are you looking for some new high-growth stocks to add to your portfolio? You could start with the most obvious option at the moment: artificial intelligence (AI) players.\n\nDescribing AI as a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity doesn't seem like hyperbole anymore. Even without knowing exactly what the AI industry will look like just five years from now, it's quite clear at this point that it's going to live up to the hype. The chief challenge now is simply figuring out which companies are best positioned to benefit.\n\nThat brings me to three artificial intelligence stocks that aren't yet fully valued in light of their potential. Arguably, each of these three tickers could explode higher once more investors connect the dots.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nYou've most likely heard of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and you may have noticed that software giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has melded its Bing search engine with an AI-powered conversational assistant called Copilot. You may have even tinkered with this tool, or with Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) comparable chatbot, Gemini (formerly called Bard). There's no denying these tools are fun to play with, in addition to being legitimately helpful to many who use them.\n\nFrom a monetization perspective though, these platforms don't appear to have a great deal of commercial appeal. ChatGPT and Copilot, however, don't represent the best use cases for artificial intelligence technology. AI platforms purpose-built for business are proving far more marketable.\n\nEnter Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR).\n\nAs a consumer, you will not have used its service. Companies like General Mills, the CBS television network, and Aramark are some of its newest clients, though, joining a growing number of enterprises using Palantir's offerings to help them do something constructive with the mountains of digitized data they've been gathering for years. The company's software is also being used by the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, energy company ExxonMobil, and drugmaker Sanofi, just to name a few. There has simply not been a data-analysis option powerful enough to pay for ... until now.\n\nPalantir Technologies has only scratched the surface of its potential, though. Analysts expect its top line to grow to the tune of 21% this year and then repeat the feat next year. CEO Alex Karp's only complaint is that the company can't keep up with demand.\n\nShares are performing well, by the way. They're up more than 50% for the past year, and higher by more than 130% for the past couple of years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's reason to expect Palantir stock could catapult higher, however, given the company's profitability as well as the fact that it's already a market leader in its niche. Technology market research outfits Gartner and Forrester Research both consistently rank it as one of the top names of the AI data-analysis space, comparing it to much bigger players like Microsoft and Alphabet.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nMost everyone understands Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) hardware sits at the heart of most artificial intelligence data centers. Analysts with Mizuho Securities suggest it controls about 90% of the AI-processor market.\n\nThose graphics processing units (GPUs) and similar powerful processors are only one piece of the technological puzzle which is an AI data center. Artificial intelligence servers are actually massive banks of individual computers that must be built around a processor and then tethered together on a giant rack (or racks). Some company has to manufacture these computers and then assemble the towers they become a part of.\n\nThat's what Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) does. Whether a customer prefers Nvidia's tech or Intel's, and whether that client wants to use Amazon's cloud computing service or Microsoft's, Super Micro Computer can deliver.\n\nAnd it's been delivering like crazy. Last quarter's top line was up an incredible 200% year over year, extending a well-established growth trend that's expected to last well into the future. Analysts are calling for revenue growth of 60% in its next fiscal year. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThat's just the beginning. Precedence Research forecasts that the AI infrastructure market will grow at an annualized pace of more than 27% through 2033 as more and more organizations rush to build the AI platforms they're increasingly realizing they'll need if they want to remain competitive.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's stock price has drifted sideways after peeling back from March's peak. It's most likely just taking a breather though, ahead of its next leg higher.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nLast but not least, add Alphabet to your list of AI stocks that could go parabolic in the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's a well-respected tech name, but some might find it tough to see the Google parent as an AI play. Although its Gemini/Bard chatbot is a clever use of AI tech, there aren't a great deal of practical commercial applications for it. Besides, the company's core business is advertising. Adding an AI profit center to the mix could be quite an undertaking.\n\nAlphabet is taking the task on, however, and is better positioned to make it worth the effort than you might think.\n\nSee, Alphabet isn't aimlessly building an AI business from scratch just for the sake of seeing what happens. It's using artificial intelligence as a means of making its existing advertising business even better. Just last week, the company announced it will soon allow advertisers to use AI-generated ads, for instance. The company also says ads will soon begin appearing within its new AI Overviews, which are a separate category of search results for anyone using the Google search engine. Of course, more meaningful data about Google's users helps advertisers as well as Alphabet.\n\nWhat could really sustain and even accelerate the stock's current advance, however, is renewed optimism from the analyst community. Bank of America analyst Justin Post recently reiterated his buy rating on Alphabet stock, citing the latest advancements in its AI advertising tech. Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan said the same.\n\nBoth recognize that advertising is and will remain Alphabet's big breadwinner into the distant future. Its foray into artificial intelligence is complementary to this business, though, without conflicting with it. Investors may be underestimating the degree of revenue growth that's in store here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "Many computer hardware makers are getting big boosts from the proliferation of artificial intelligence. Of course, a huge number of computer chips are needed to create and maintain artificial intelligence (AI). Data centers are playing a huge role in creating and disseminating AI, so many of the leading makers of equipment for data centers are likely to thrive going forward. Also on the AI front, the demand for AI PCs is likely to be strong going forward, creating opportunities for a high number of additional computer hardware makers.\n\nIn a different but related area, robots \u2014 thanks to AI \u2014 appear to be nearly set to finally enter consumer homes on a major scale, creating great opportunities for a large number of computer hardware stocks. Here are the three best companies in the space for investors who want to exploit these strong trends.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, \u201cArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) sells datacenter hardware, such as switches, routing products and VPNs.\u201d The firm is also poised to gain ground in the $45 billion Ethernet switches market. That\u2019s because Arista\u2019s switches can interface with the most advanced chips more efficiently than Cisco\u2018s (NASDAQ:CSCO) switches. In 2023, Cisco had a 40% share of the Ethernet switches market versus Arista\u2019s 10% allotment. Arista also offers network equipment that can be used to support AI PCs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe hardware maker reported very impressive fiscal first-quarter financial results on May 6. They indicate these strong, positive catalysts are significantly boosting Arista\u2019s top and bottom lines. Specifically, earnings per share (EPS) soared 39% to $1.99 compared to the year earlier. Sales also advanced 16% year-over-year to $1.57 billion. Analysts, on average, had only expected the firm to generate EPS of $1.74. Also encouragingly, the firm announced a new $1.2 billion stock repurchase plan.\n\nIn recent weeks, ANET stock enjoyed strong momentum as the shares jumped 28% between Apr. 22 and May 29.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper MicroComputer (NASDAQ:SMCI) specializes in making servers that work in conjunction with the products of all of the leading makers of AI chips, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nMultiple major Wall Street banks have been very bullish on SMCI stock recently. Bank of America noted Nvidia said many consumer-facing companies and other types of firms were embracing AI for the first time. The bank expects Super Micro to significantly benefit from this strong trend. Bank of America also noted Super Micro already has footholds with companies in multiple sectors, including \u201cfinancial services, drug discovery and autonomous vehicles.\u201d And Super Micro is holding talks with governments about supporting their forays into AI. Bank of America maintained its \u201cbuy\u201d rating and its $1,090 price target on SMCI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter speaking with Super Micro\u2019s CFO, JPMorgan said the tech firm has a \u201cstrong (and record) backlog.\u201d The bank expects the company to benefit from price hikes and increased revenue as it upgrades its servers.\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nIndustrial automation firm Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) develops \u201cintegrated robot solutions\u201d and specializes in providing industrial robots. Already becoming a huge business, industrial robots are slated to become much more popular in the medium-to-long term amid continued AI advancements.\n\nA record total of over 44,300 robots were shipped to American manufacturers last year. In addition to AI improvements, labor shortages and higher speed and efficiency requirements will drive higher adoption of robots in the longer term,\u00a0Association for Advancing Automation president Jeff Burnstein told Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\n\nIn September 2023, Rockwell acquired Canada-based Clearpath Robotics, which Rockwell described as \u201ca leader in autonomous robotics for industrial applications.\u201d The deal should help Rockwell meet the increasing demand for high-speed robots in the manufacturing sector.\n\nAnd Rockwell could even eventually branch out to providing robots for consumer homes. According to Ken Goldberg, a robotics professor at the University of California, Berkeley,\u00a0technology is getting advanced and cheap enough that robots will soon become useful additions to homes. Indeed, Tesla is considering selling its robot, Optimus, to consumers at the end of 2025.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in SMCI, ANET and INTC.

        "content": "(1:30) - Using The Fibonacci Retracement To Know When To Buy and Sell Your Investments (12:20) - Top Performing Stocks: Breaking Down The Charts To Find A Possible Buy (29:40)- Episode Roundup: COST, CMG, NVDA, SMCI, GOOGL, VRT Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #403 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week Tracey is joined by Zacks Stock Strategist and the editor of Zacks Counterstrike newsletter, Jeremy Mullin, to discuss the Fibonacci retracement levels on a handful of hot stocks as well as the major indexes including the S&P 500, the NASDAQ and the Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), which is the small caps.\n\nFibonacci Retracement Levels Are Another Tool\n\nFibonacci retracement levels look for areas of price resistance and support on stock charts. Jeremy uses Fibonacci retracement levels like a map. There are no guarantees with the retracement levels. Sometimes they hold, and sometimes they do not. And this includes both to the upside and to the downside.\n\nThe retracement levels are meant to be a guideline. But investors and traders can use them as another arsenal in their technical toolbox, in addition to knowing the company\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nJeremy and Tracey looked at a bunch of hot stocks that have hit Jeremy\u2019s top Fibonacci retracement levels, to see where the sell-off Fibonacci retracement levels could possibly be.\n\nMissed out on the trade? There are always pullbacks and sell offs in stocks. Yes, even NVIDIA has pulled back in the last year.\n\nWhat price should you be looking at for the pullback?\n\n5 Hot Stocks and Their Fibonacci Retracement Levels\n\n1. Vertiv Holdings Co. (VRT)\n\nVertiv provides infrastructure solutions and services in the areas of data centers, communication networks and commercial and industrial facilities including cooling and power. It is an AI play.\n\nShares of Vertiv have soared 115% year-to-date and are trading near all-time highs. As Jeremy discusses in the podcast, there have been few opportunities to get in on a pull-back on Vertiv so far as the stock has steadily ground higher.\n\nWhat are Vertiv\u2019s Fibonacci retracement levels?\n\n2. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer has been one of the big AI and data center winners of the last year. Sales are expected to jump 109.7% this year.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer have soared 188% year-to-date. But this is an instance where the stock IS pulling back. Super Micro Computer is down 5.5% over the last 3 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Super Micro Computer closing in on key Fibonacci retracement levels right now?\n\n3. Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)\n\nCostco has a cult-like following among both shoppers and stock investors. Sales are expected to rise 4.6% in fiscal 2024.\n\nShares of Costco have been hitting new all-time highs, gaining 23.6% year-to-date. Who dares to buy it at these lofty levels?\n\nJeremy has a Fibonacci retracement level at a much lower price than current levels. Should you be a buyer of Costco if it gets there?\n\n4. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG)\n\nChipotle is one of the top restaurant stocks this year. Shares of Chipotle have soared 34% year-to-date to new all-time highs.\n\nChipotle is still doing double digit sales growth as well, with sales expected to rise 15% in 2024. The company is doing a 50-to-1 stock split on June 6, 2024, so keep that in mind when watching Jeremy discuss Fibonacci retracement levels.\n\nWhat are the Fibonacci retracement levels telling us about Chipotle?\n\n5. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nDid you miss out the pullback in NVIDIA earlier this year? Shares of NVIDIA have skyrocketed, again, after the recent earnings report. The stock is up 28.7% over the last 4 weeks. NVIDIA is up 128% for the year.\n\nSales are expected to soar in fiscal 2025, up 91%.\n\nAll stocks have pullbacks. What are the Fibonacci retracement levels for NVIDIA?\n\nWant to See the Fibonacci Retracement Levels on the Charts?\n\nJeremy shares all the charts and talks all the Fibonacci retracement levels.

        "title": "Can Super Micro (SMCI) Run Higher on Rising Earnings Estimates?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) could be a solid choice for investors given the company's remarkably improving earnings outlook. While the stock has been a strong performer lately, this trend might continue since analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company.\n\nThe upward trend in estimate revisions for this server technology company reflects growing optimism of analysts on its earnings prospects, which should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is principally built on this insight.\n\nThe five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.\n\nFor Super Micro, there has been strong agreement among the covering analysts in raising earnings estimates, which has helped push consensus estimates considerably higher for the next quarter and full year.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nCurrent-Quarter Estimate Revisions\n\nThe earnings estimate of $7.95 per share for the current quarter represents a change of +126.5% from the number reported a year ago.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Super Micro has increased 11.92% over the last 30 days, as three estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revisions.\n\nCurrent-Year Estimate Revisions\n\nThe company is expected to earn $23.51 per share for the full year, which represents a change of +99.07% from the prior-year number.\n\nThe revisions trend for the current year also appears quite promising for Super Micro, with four estimates moving higher over the past month compared to no negative revisions. The consensus estimate has also received a boost over this time frame, increasing 6.22%.\n\nFavorable Zacks Rank\n\nThe promising estimate revisions have helped Super Micro earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank is a tried-and-tested rating tool that helps investors effectively harness the power of earnings estimate revisions and make the right investment decision. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) significantly outperform the S&P 500.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile strong estimate revisions for Super Micro have attracted decent investments and pushed the stock 13.7% higher over the past four weeks, further upside may still be left in the stock. So, you may consider adding it to your portfolio right away.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Missed the Nvidia Train? 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "The Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) juggernaut is showing no signs of stopping as the semiconductor behemoth delivered another set of stunning results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (for the three months ended April 28) on May 22 that easily crushed Wall Street's expectations.\n\nWhile Nvidia's revenue jumped a whopping 262% year over year to $26 billion, its non-GAAP earnings shot up 461% to $6.12 per share. Analysts would have settled for $5.60 per share in earnings on revenue of $24.6 billion. What's more, Nvidia has guided for fiscal second-quarter revenue of $28 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be more than double the $13.5 billion revenue it posted in the prior-year period and well above the $26.6 billion consensus estimate.\n\nThere were more goodies in store for Nvidia investors as the company increased its quarterly-cash dividend by 150% and also pointed out that it will start shipping its next-generation Blackwell chips ahead of schedule. All this indicates that Nvidia's red-hot stock market rally is here to stay. The stock has jumped 115% in 2024 already, and its latest results and guidance point toward more gains.\n\nBut if you're one of those investors who have missed the Nvidia gravy train and are wary of buying the stock now because of its expensive valuation -- even though it may be able to justify it -- it would be a good idea to take a closer look at Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). Let's look at the reasons why.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nNvidia's phenomenal results gave server manufacturer Super Micro Computer a nice boost. That wasn't surprising as the robust demand for Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI)-focused chips bodes well for Super Micro, whose server solutions are used for mounting those chips in data centers.\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the demand for its current and next-generation chips could exceed supply going into 2025. That's good news for Super Micro as it should continue to see healthy demand for its AI-optimized servers and sustain the terrific growth it has been clocking in recent quarters. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nSMCI Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nSuper Micro's revenue forecast of $14.9 billion for the current fiscal year would translate into a 110% increase from the previous year's reading of $7.1 billion. Similarly, its earnings expectation of $23.69 per share for fiscal 2024 would be double last year's level of $11.81 per share. However, it won't be surprising to see Super Micro growing at a faster pace than it is currently forecasting.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's because the company has already revealed server solutions for Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which will start shipping in the current quarter and ramp up as the year progresses. Reports suggest that Super Micro has already received huge orders for servers optimized for mounting Blackwell processors, and it could be expected to fulfill a quarter of the demand for servers built using Nvidia's next-gen chips.\n\nNot surprisingly, Super Micro's top and bottom lines are expected to grow substantially over the next couple of fiscal years. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSMCI Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nSuper Micro's revenue is expected to quadruple in just three years (given that it delivered $7.1 billion in revenue in the previous fiscal year), while earnings could jump 3.5 times by fiscal 2026 from fiscal 2023's reading of $11.81 per share. More importantly, it isn't too late for investors to buy this AI stock as it is trading at an attractive 4.4 times sales and 25 times forward earnings.\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, has a sales multiple of 33 along with a forward-earnings multiple of 43. Even better, analysts are expecting Super Micro's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 62% for the next five years, giving investors yet another solid reason to accumulate this stock before it flies higher.\n\n2. Snowflake\n\nSnowflake may not be as popular an AI name as the other two companies discussed in this article. But the company, which provides a cloud-based platform that helps organizations to store, organize, analyze, and build applications using their proprietary data, believes that AI could become its next big growth driver.\n\nSnowflake stock is down over 21% in 2024 thanks to poor guidance and management transition announced in February. However, the company's first-quarter fiscal 2025 results (for the three months ended April 30) suggest that AI could play an important role in driving future growth.\n\nThe company's top line increased 33% year over year to $829 million, easily exceeding the $787 million consensus estimate. More importantly, the company's fiscal Q2 product-revenue forecast of $805 million to $810 million was ahead of the $793 million estimate and points toward a year-over-year increase of 26.5% at the midpoint. The company has also raised its full-year product-revenue guidance to $3.3 billion from $3.25 billion.\n\nSnowflake's remaining performance obligations, a metric that refers to the total value of a company's contracts that are yet to be fulfilled, increased 46% year over year to $5 billion. That was faster than the growth in its top line, indicating that the company is building a solid revenue pipeline for the future.\n\nIt seems that AI is playing a central role in boosting Snowflake's growth prospects. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy pointed out in the company's press release: \"Our AI products, now generally available, are generating strong customer interest. They will help our customers deliver effective and efficient AI-powered experiences faster than ever.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that Snowflake has been investing aggressively in AI infrastructure and has been looking to quickly deploy AI-focused products to help its customers make the most of their data. The company has also teamed up with Nvidia to help its customers deploy custom AI models for various tasks, such as translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, extracting content from documents, and creating generative AI-powered assistants.\n\nAdditionally, Snowflake is looking to shore up its AI capabilities by acquiring TruEra, an observability platform that will allow enterprises to monitor and evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning models. Such moves should allow Snowflake to set itself up for stronger long-term growth as high-quality data is important for the development of robust, generative AI applications.\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see Snowflake stock gaining momentum as its AI-focused moves start paying off. The stock is currently trading at 17 times sales. Though that's expensive, the sales multiple is lower than last year's reading of 24 and significantly cheaper than Nvidia. However, it may become more expensive in the future thanks to Snowflake's growing AI chops, which is why it would be a good idea to buy it before it soars higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "5 Top-Ranked Stocks Powering Nasdaq's Rally to the 17,000 Mark",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite Index hit a series of record highs and closed above the 17,000 milestone for the first time ever. Solid corporate earnings, artificial intelligence (AI) boom and rate cut bets have been driving stocks higher. In particular, NVIDIA\u2019s blockbuster earnings spread huge optimism in the stock market along with the global artificial intelligence boom. This drove Nasdaq further up. The tech-heavy index has risen 13.4% so far this year.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the stocks have performed well this year, we have highlighted five of them that more than doubled this year and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These are Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, Vital Farms Inc. VITL, Powell Industries Inc. POWL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and AppLovin Corporation APP. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA topped both earnings and revenue estimates and offered a bullish revenue outlook for the current quarter, thanks to the solid demand for its AI-enabled GPU chips. The AI chipmaker announced a 10-to-1 stock split, effective Jun 7, and increased its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to 10 cents per share.\r\n\r\nPer the latest survey from Bank of America, expectations of interest rate cuts rather than earnings optimism have made investors the \"most bullish\" since November 2021. About 82% of global fund managers expect the first rate cut by the Fed in the second half, while 78% say a recession is unlikely in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth in the tech sector and beyond. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to reach $811.75 billion by 2030.\r\n\r\nHowever, concerns over stubborn inflation once again might halt the rally in the Index. This is because the Fed minutes and upbeat manufacturing data, both of which highlight concerns over stubborn inflation, have again pushed back the timing of rate cuts.\r\n\r\nWhile inflation has eased over the past year, it failed to show further progress toward the Fed\u2019s 2% objective in recent months, per its latest minutes. As such, the disinflation process would likely take longer than previously thought. Meanwhile, U.S. business activity growth accelerated sharply to its fastest pace in more than two years in May after two months of slower growth led by an upturn in the service sector. The data indicates that the U.S. economy is back on course for another solid GDP gain in the second quarter. The strength in the economy could spark a revival in inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nSuper Micro designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) The Best High Growth Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently compiled the list of the 10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other fast growth stocks. Recently Baron Funds said the following about NVIDIA Corporation:\n\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the Fund\u2019s largest position. We believe NVIDIA continues to be at the epicenter of one of the biggest technological paradigm shifts of the last 50 years as computing is shifting from sequential to accelerated and as we begin to see the early stages of the use cases of generative AI (GenAI) enter the mainstream. Is GenAI real? Is it going to be material, sustainable, and disruptive? Will NVIDIA (and other GenAI leaders and disruptors) likely benefit from this disruptive change? Our research suggests that the answer to all of these questions is an unequivocal \u2013 yes\"\n\nYou can see Baron Funds' entire comments here.\n\nGrowth stocks are those that are either growing their revenue in mid to high double or triple digit percentages or those who trade at significantly higher prices when compared to their earnings. Using a high P/E ratio is the more commonly accepted definition of growth stocks, and sometimes, investors are richly rewarded for their faith.\n\nWhile we'll get to the specifics later, there are several stock indexes and exchange traded funds that track growth stocks. Some of the more popular growth stock indexes and ETFs are Vanguard Growth Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIGAX) ETF and the S&P 500 Pure Growth stock index. The performance of these ETFs and indexes depends, for most part, on the economic climate. A well known investment principle is that growth stocks perform well when interest rates are low and consumers and businesses are able to comfortably splurge for pricey products and services.\n\nYear to date, the Vanguard Growth Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIGAX) and the S&P 500 Pure Growth index are up by 15% and 12%, respectively. This allows the S&P stock index to match the benchmark index in performance, while the Vanguard Fund has gained more since the S&P is up by roughly 12% year to date.\n\nOver the past twelve months, a period characterized by high but stable interest rates, easing inflation, robust economic growth, and the AI boom, the S&P 500 has gained 27.7%. The index bottomed in October 2023 and so did our ETF and index. The Vanguard ETF is up by 34.9% over the year, and the S&P Pure Growth index has lagged the broader index through its 24% gains. Compare these all around rosy figures with the 32% that the index lost between January 2022 and June 2022 and the additional 32% bled by the ETF and you'll see how growth stocks are sensitive to high rates and inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, trying to see where interest rates are heading would also serve one well when talking about fast growth stocks. On this front, one 'proxy' that can be used to gauge investor sentiment is the Russel 2000 index. This is a small cap stock index, and if investors become optimistic about lighter rates, then the shares rise since smaller firms are often more at risk from higher rates than corporate titans.\n\nSmall-cap stock indices have been relatively flat year to date by having registered an unimpressive 2% in gains. This is unsurprising as the year has seen Wall Street progressively tone down rate cut expectations. However, from mid April to late May, the small caps have gained 6%, so perhaps the winds are changing for interest rates. However, this hasn't been the case, since two of its strongest performing stocks have posted 100%+ in gains. One of these is a fast growth stock when compared to the broader benchmark multiple.\n\nThis stock is none other than the rather infamous Super Micro. If you're unaware, Super Micro has been caught in the market's artificial intelligence surge too since it is a semiconductor stock. It has a trailing twelve month price to earnings ratio of 49.27 which is high compared to the commonly accepted definition of a growth stock. However, Super Micro's P/E ratio is lower than the semiconductor sector average of 82.75. The market trailing P/E for this data set is 52.28, and it represents 94 sectors. Within these sectors, 26 have a higher trailing P/E ratio than the market ratio, and among these, nearly half have a higher trailing P/E ratio than the semiconductor industry. However, the higher value for semiconductors is a clear example of how artificial intelligence has transformed the market.\n\nYet, even before AI was a part of daily media coverage, semiconductor stocks had already given us a historic growth story. This comes in the form of the chip designer AMD. AMD's shares are up by a whopping 506% over the past five years, while the S&P 500 has gained 92% during the time period. Despite this stunning growth, the AI onset has led AMD to have a trailing P/E ratio of a whopping 232.51 (forward P/E is 45.66, which is precisely in tune with the sector's 45.77). Between 2010 and 2025, AMD's profitability trend started in 2018, and saw the P/E ratio jump to 515 in early 2023 when earnings took a hit from a glut in the semiconductor industry. AMD's eight cents of EPS in the third quarter of 2023 also meant that as the market bumped its valuation due to AI, the P/E ratio soared 1,285 - making it a classic example of a fast growth stock.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best fast growth stocks, we first narrowed down the 20 stocks that had the highest trailing P/E ratios and five year and quarter over quarter revenue growth greater than 30%. These were ranked through the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024 according to Insider Monkey's data of hedge fund holdings. Moreover, for each of these stocks, we looked at how many hedge funds from our database held shares according to the last round of 13F filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 186\n\nTTM P/E Ratio: 62.12\n\nAI and semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) tops our list of the best fast growth stocks, which is unsurprising if we're honest. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have soared by triple digit percentages over the past year, and this has also been the case for its revenue and profit. The latest set of results for the first quarter saw NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat analyst revenue estimates of $24.6 billion by posting $26 billion. Adjusted EPS of $6.12 beat analyst estimates of $5.59.\n\nBy Q1 2024 end, 186 out of the 933 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners held the largest stake which was worth $12 billion.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks first on our list of the best high growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Click to see the 10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy Now. NVDA is now a $2.8 trillion company and trades at a forward PE of 41. Assuming that its extremely high growth rate continues for a few more years, this is a very cheap stock. This is a big assumption that hedge funds and other investors are betting on right now. The market is assuming that NVDA will earn nearly $70 billion over the next 12 months, $100 billion in 2 years, $150 billion in 3 years, and then grow those profits at high single digits for the foreseeable future (the same rate S&P 500 companies grow their earnings annually). I think the probability of this happening is less than 50% as NVDA needs to defend its moat for a couple of decades which is a very long time in the tech industry. Intel couldn\u2019t defend its moat for two decades and now trades at less than NVDA\u2019s 2026 expected earnings. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and A New Dawn Is Coming to US Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Should You Invest in Super Micro (SMCI) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Super Micro Computer (SMCI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nSuper Micro currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.92, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.92 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SMCI Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for SMCI\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Super Micro here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Super Micro, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs SMCI Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Super Micro, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.3% over the past month to $23.51.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Super Micro. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Super Micro may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia\u2019s Coattails: 3 Stocks to Ride the AI Chipmaker\u2019s Earnings Success",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just released what was arguably its best earnings report ever. Revenues and profitability both reached historical highs, and the company bested Wall Street\u2019s expectations. That report showed that revenues grew by 18% in Q1, reaching $26 billion. This has lead investors to start eyeing other AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe blowout report from Nvidia should serve to pull the broader AI sector higher still. Nvidia dominates the sector but there is a massive opportunity for other firms. Let\u2019s look at three of the more AI stocks to buy following Nvidia\u2019s latest positive news.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is the primary challenger to Nvidia in the race for artificial intelligence dominance. It\u2019s a battle in which AMD has long been trailing. Honestly, that\u2019s not likely to change soon. It\u2019s clear that demand for Nvidia\u2019s best chips is much greater than that for AMD best.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd that\u2019s not a bad thing. AMD actually has a very comfortable position at the moment. it has established its chips as the lower priced alternative to those from Nvidia. The largest and most important chip buyers including companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have made no secret about it. They are willing to invest heavily in AMD chips despite their slightly lower performance specifications.\n\nIn other words, AMD is in the enviable position of receiving the positive benefits of enterprise frustration with Nvidia\u2019s pricing strategies. It\u2019s a pretty good place to be while simultaneously making efforts to best Nvidia\u2019s AI chips.\n\nBeyond that, Nvidia doesn\u2019t have enough supply to meet demand, offering AMD another opportunity to prove its chips.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock has been noted as a beneficiary of Nvidia\u2019s bounce across headlines covering the financial world.\n\nThe memory chip provider recently forged a relationship with Nvidia that should set it up for a period of strong success. Micron Technology is one of the leading providers of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. Those are integral to artificial intelligence. It is a segment dominated by Korean firms SK Hynix and Samsung.\n\nFortunately for Micron Technology, it has forged a strong relationship with Nvidia due to its superior memory process. That has allowed the company to make significant headway as a competitor to the two Korean firms. Micron Technology\u2019s opportunity looks to be strengthening following news that Samsung\u2019s HBM chips are failing Nvidia\u2019s tests.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Samsung refutes the claims, and Nvidia declined to comment, Sources say that Samsung has been trying to pass Nvidia\u2019s tests since last year. Those same sources say that the most recent failure occurred in April and is just now coming to light.\n\nMicron Technology is in prime position as a result.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock is bound to be both interesting and volatile in the wake of Nvidia\u2019s blowout earnings report.\n\nBased on price movement, it\u2019s clear that some traders were only interested in securing gains following the earnings print. Prices jumped up on the news and then receded as profit takers sold their positions.\n\nInvestors shouldn\u2019t take that to mean that the opportunity in Super Micro Computer is over. Remember, Super Micro Computer sells servers heavily featuring Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. The company\u2019s shares have soared as companies of all sizes\u00a0 have moved to deploy artificial intelligence at scale.\n\nThe latest news again proves that Nvidia continues to see extraordinarily high demand. That should translate to increased demand for the server packages that Super Micro Computer produces.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised that investors took profits off the table on the strong news. It\u2019s understandable. However, also be aware that the data center opportunity is extraordinarily strong, especially given that it accounted for $22.6 billion of Nvidia\u2019s $26 billion in sales during the first quarter.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When many people think of artificial intelligence (AI) giants, they think of the chipmakers powering AI models. And these companies -- such as Nvidia -- have seen their earnings and shares take off. But a behind-the-scenes player also has been generating enormous growth, thanks to the AI boom. I'm talking about Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of servers, storage systems, full rack scale solutions, and other key elements needed in data centers.\n\nThe company has been around for more than 30 years, but earnings just started to take off a few years ago as customers began launching AI programs -- and realizing the benefits of investing in Supermicro's products. The company recently reported its first $3 billion quarter, making more in revenue in three months than it did in a full year as recently as 2021.\n\nAs a result of soaring demand and earnings, the stock price has followed, climbing more than 2,300% in three years. What may be next from this established player that's found a whole new source of growth thanks to AI demand? My prediction is that Supermicro may take inspiration from Nvidia, and this will be the company's next big move. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSupermicro's problem\n\nFirst, this move could address one particular problem Supermicro faces right now. It's great the stock has climbed, but this movement has left it trading at more than $800 today. A few months ago, the shares even soared past $1,000.\n\nOften, these levels make it difficult for a broad range of investors to get in on stock. Yes, you could buy fractional shares, but some brokerages don't offer them. And in certain cases, investors prefer owning a full share over going the fractional-share route.\n\nFinally, the level of $1,000 may represent a psychological barrier. Even if a stock is cheap from a valuation perspective, some investors will look at it as if it's too pricey.\n\nNvidia has found itself in a similar situation, with its stock soaring past $900 in recent times. In response to this, the company announced a stock split last week. It said its motive is to make it easier for employees and investors to buy shares.\n\nStock splits don't change the overall market value of a company or the value of your investment. Instead, they offer current holders more shares, which lowers the value of each individual share. That way, new investors can buy the stock at a lower price.\n\nFollowing Nvidia's lead\n\nMy prediction is Supermicro will follow Nvidia's lead, and the company's next big move will be the announcement of a stock split. Supermicro has never split its stock before, but that doesn't mean it opposes such an operation. Prior to the surge in AI demand, Supermicro's shares traded at much lower levels -- about $80 in late 2022 -- so there was no need to launch a split.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, though, a stock split would make sense. First, as mentioned, it would help a wider range of investors add Supermicro to their portfolios. Second, it would signal the company is confident about its future and believes the stock could start off from a lower level and take off once again.\n\nSupermicro has recently spoken of record demand for its AI rack scale systems\u00a0-- those that incorporate chips from leaders such as Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices. As these players continue to launch new and better-performing chips, Supermicro will launch products incorporating those chips -- and that should continue to lift revenue.\n\nIn fact, Supermicro said recently it expects AI demand to continue for a number of years. So right now would be a great time to bring the price of each individual share down to a level that would attract more and more investors.\n\nMy prediction is this will be Supermicro's next big move. However, whether this happens or not, the stock still makes a top technology buy today, thanks to the company's high growth in recent times and bright future prospects.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Insiders Sell US$27m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",
        "content": "Over the past year, many Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Founder, Charles Liang, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$13m worth of shares at a price of US$252 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$884. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.9% of Charles Liang's holding.\n\nIn total, Super Micro Computer insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. They sold for an average price of about US$304. It's not particularly great to see insiders were selling shares at below recent prices. Since insiders sell for many reasons, we wouldn't put too much weight on it. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this freelist of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nInsiders At Super Micro Computer Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Super Micro Computer. In total, Independent Director Sherman Tuan sold US$4.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Super Micro Computer insiders own 14% of the company, worth about US$7.4b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Super Micro Computer Insiders?\n\nAn insider hasn't bought Super Micro Computer stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since Super Micro Computer is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Super Micro Computer (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.\n\nOf course Super Micro Computer may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "The AI Money Flow: Why You Can't Afford to Miss Stocks Like Nvidia and Snowflake",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is well underway. Kickstarted by OpenAI's ChatGPT introduction near the end of 2022, surging interest in generative AI and machine learning systems has rebalanced the stock market. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) carry two of the three largest market caps these days, largely thanks to their direct involvement in OpenAI's generative AI innovation. In the long run, the same ideas could reshape the global economy, too.\n\nOn the brink of a transformative AI era, it's crucial to consider not just the promises of innovation but also the broader economic and societal shifts at play. Will the rise of AI herald a new age of prosperity, or will it deepen existing inequalities? Do AI tools actually create wealth -- or simply redistribute assets to a new group of money-making kingpins?\n\nI can't claim to have all the answers, but let's start thinking about the dual nature of AI's economic impact. While I see the makings of groundbreaking wealth creation, there's likely some basic redistribution happening as well.\n\nSources of AI revenue and profits\n\nHave you ever thought about where Nvidia's and Microsoft's AI revenue streams start from? The current situation isn't radically different from what came before, but I think the world is headed down some very different economic avenues in the near future.\n\n1. AI-enabling hardware\n\nA significant portion of AI profits currently comes from the sale of hardware necessary for AI computations. Large Language Models (LLM) and machine learning systems need to be trained, and systems facing the final customer (which can be a consumer or a corporation) also need to manage the flow of AI requests and responses.\n\nIt's heavy computational lifting and requires a whole new level of processing power. Companies like Nvidia are seeing explosive growth due to their high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), which also serve as AI accelerators and are crucial for training and deploying AI models. The high demand for these components drives revenue and fuels high stock valuations.\n\n2. Software and services\n\nFollow the AI dollar another step up the food chain, and you'll see who's buying those expensive server-side AI chips.\n\nAI-driven software and platforms are another major revenue source. Microsoft, for example, integrates AI into its cloud services, offering advanced analytics, machine learning models, and AI-powered applications through the Azure cloud computing service. Subscription models and enterprise solutions provide steady revenue streams.\n\nStory continues\n\nAgain, a significant portion of the software-level income is passed down to hardware makers like Nvidia and system builders such as Super Micro Computers(NASDAQ: SMCI). The data analytics and training software won't run on air or outdated calculator chips, after all. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Consumer products\n\nAnd who is paying the software giants? In many cases, it's the global consumer.\n\nAI is becoming increasingly embedded in consumer products. From AI-powered virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa to personalized recommendations on platforms like Netflix and Spotify, these applications drive user engagement and generate significant revenue through subscriptions, ads, and sales of smart devices. The next round of smartphone flagships is touting AI-boosted cameras and personal assistants. New cars come with SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) voice controls, powered by a unique machine learning system and channeled through the ChatGPT experience. It don't mean a thing if you ain't got that AI swing.\n\nThis is where the AI rubber hits the world-changing road. There's one more revenue stream to consider, but the AI boom won't get very far if consumers aren't paying for the newfangled computer tools in some way.\n\n4. Enterprise applications\n\nAnd here's the last stop on the road to AI wealth. Businesses across every sector are adopting AI to optimize operations, enhance decision-making, and add innovative features to their consumer-facing products. AI-driven solutions in healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing are creating substantial value, leading to increased investments in AI technologies and services.\n\nOnce again, a generous portion of this revenue is passed down the line through the software layer and to the hardware providers.\n\nIn this light, Nvidia's market-crushing surge is starting to make sense.\n\nFuture sources of AI-based winnings\n\nI think this is the start of a game-changing revolution. Others have compared the generative AI promise to the early days of the internet, the first smartphones, or steam engines launching the industrial revolution. Throw in the wheel, the electric guitar, or the first TV dinner, and we might be onto some significant innovations here.\n\nSo, where will the AI revenue streams start from in the future? In the end, all roads seem to lead right back to the consumer.\n\n1. Autonomous systems\n\nThe development of autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotics should provide a serious revenue source, with AI brains at the proverbial wheel. Companies investing in these technologies, such as Tesla and Waymo, are pioneering advancements that could revolutionize transportation and logistics, potentially creating new markets and revenue streams.\n\nIn many cases, they will fight over the ordinary consumer's family budget. At some point, I'll consider selling my last car to rely on AI-driven robo-taxis for my transportation needs. That's fewer dollars headed to Detroit and the Japanese car giants but more cash aimed at the tech giants of AI automation. Ka-ching!\n\n2. AI-driven innovation\n\nAs AI technologies mature, they will likely spur the creation of entirely new industries and services. Biotech investors can look forward to AI-driven drug discovery, energy experts have smart power grids on their minds, and agriculture lovers should have precision farming soon -- all driven by artificial intelligence. I'm only scratching the surface of a vast opportunity here. The next game-changing AI breakthrough could emerge from any sector, as every industry is hunting for that killer AI innovation.\n\nThis explosion of computer-assisted innovation could open up vast new markets, contributing to more effective solutions and long-term revenue growth. In a very real sense, this involves creating more wealth from the world's existing resources.\n\n3. Data monetization\n\nAI relies heavily on data. System training starts with massive data stores, and AI is at its most efficient when it can auto-analyze a ton of relevant data. Companies that can effectively harness and monetize data will have a competitive edge. Businesses could profit by offering data-as-a-service (DaaS) models, providing insights and analytics to other companies while also leveraging their own operating data to enhance their services and customer experiences.\n\nSo, it's a mixed bag. The examples above include a direct consumer connection, a creator of more real-world value, and an intermediary layer that should boom as long as AI systems need more data. Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) are early leaders in this particular race, and Zebra Technologies' (NASDAQ: ZBRA) expertise in data collection and management shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nBalancing wealth creation and redistribution\n\nThe generative AI boom is poised to create significant wealth through a variety of channels, from hardware and software sales to groundbreaking innovations in new industries.\n\nHowever, the benefits of this wealth creation may not be evenly distributed. Investors stand to gain substantially, but broader societal impacts, such as job displacement and inequality, must be carefully managed. Ordinary consumers will benefit from better products and services, but the AI industry will also funnel a ton of money out of their wallets.\n\nBy weighing the opportunities against challenges, AI stakeholders can ensure that the sea change leads to sustainable economic growth and widespread benefits. This includes investing in education and retraining, promoting fair competition, and ensuring robust privacy protections. With a balanced approach to AI growth, the transformative power of AI can be harnessed while addressing its potential downsides, paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Large-Cap Stocks That Have Roughly Doubled Nvidia's Returns Over the Past Year",
        "content": "Chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the great investing stories in tech over the past couple of years. With the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT and companies investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia's business is booming as its chips play a big role in helping companies develop their own AI models. That business boom is helping the stock soar. In the past 12 months, its price is up about 238%.\n\nBut as well as Nvidia's stock has done in the past year, there are a couple of other large-cap stocks that have performed even better. Two stocks that have roughly doubled Nvidia's returns over the past 12 months include Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA). Here's a look at their returns over this time frame and why they have been such hot buys, and whether they still make for good investments today.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: 445%\n\nWith gains of 445%, Super Micro's stock has dwarfed Nvidia's 12-month returns. As with Nvidia, this has become a popular AI investment to own as demand for more servers and greater computing power has made investors bullish on the company's long-term prospects.\n\nSuper Micro's growth rate has been amazing, with sales totaling just under $3.9 billion through the first three months of the year -- three times the $1.3 billion it reported in the previous year. The company generates revenue primarily from its server and storage systems segment. Subsystems and accessories, its other segment, accounted for a relatively modest $152 million last quarter, representing just 4% of the company's overall top line. Profitability has also been improving, with Super Micro reporting $402 million in profit during the period, which was more than four times the $86 million in earnings it posted in the prior-year period.\n\nA big reason for Super Micro's enhanced returns over the past year is simply due to its much smaller valuation. Even with its massive returns, Super Micro's market cap is at $53 billion -- nowhere near Nvidia's mammoth $2.3 trillion valuation. What's encouraging is that the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 25, which is fairly modest given the gains the stock has already achieved. Nvidia, by comparison, trades at a forward P/E of 38.\n\nWith tremendous growth, solid prospects for more, and a fairly reasonable valuation given its long-term growth opportunities, it may still not be too late to invest in Super Micro stock.\n\nCarvana: 876%\n\nInvestors could have earned an even greater return from Carvana's stock over the past year but not without taking on a lot more risk. This once-beaten-down stock would have been a nine-bagger for investors who loaded up on it a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt wasn't too long ago that this was the stock nobody wanted: In 2022, shares of Carvana plummeted an amazing 98%. The online used-car retailer was burning through cash, interest rates began to rise, and demand for used cars softened.\n\nThe stock is heavily shorted, and that plays a big part in its overall volatility. While the short interest as a percentage of float has come down over the past year, it remains fairly high at around 30%. CVNA Percent of Float Short Chart\n\nThe company has been proving its doubters wrong, at least to some extent, and that has helped drive the recent bullishness.\n\nFor the period ending March 31, Carvana posted a surprise profit of $49 million, which is a drastic improvement from the $286 million loss it incurred in the same period a year earlier. Sales of $3.1 billion were also up by 17% year over year. The company's cash-flow statement has also shown improvement as last quarter Carvana generated $101 million in cash from its day-to-day operating activities, while a year ago it burned through $66 million.\n\nCarvana generated some encouraging results last quarter, but that doesn't mean it's smooth sailing for the business as it's possible that a recession could still be on the horizon. And while the company has been doing better, it still hasn't proven it can generate consistent profits; its profit margin last quarter was just 1.6%.\n\nInvestors may be better off waiting at least a couple of quarters before assessing whether Carvana is truly a good buy or not, as the stock still possesses some considerable risk, especially given its volatility over the past few years and high short interest.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "Recent conferences have shown that the pace of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation is accelerating. Given this continued progress in the field, AI stocks to buy will perform well going forward.\n\nOver the past month, a series of AI conferences have highlighted innovations in the space. First, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) made AI announcements at Google\u2019s annual developers conference. It outlined updates to DeepMind and Gemini and unveiled new features leveraging AI like Ask Photos, AI Overviews and Imagen 3.\n\nOther AI leaders are also rapidly innovating as this space heats up. Indeed, OpenAI attempted to upstage Google by releasing its latest model, GPT-4o, before the Google Conference. And, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) followed up with its Copilot+ PCs announcement on May 20.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAll these announcements bode well for investments in the compute and data layers. Semiconductor companies are designing advanced chips to solve AI compute. Meanwhile, other players are solving data problems and building applications on large language models. These AI stocks to buy are already central to AI infrastructure and will play a key role going forward.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) has rallied over 90% year-to-date (YTD). Despite the substantial gain, it remains one of the AI stocks to buy, given the exposure to the AI server market. Furthermore, an upgrade cycle of laptops and PCs to AI-powered ones could be a key catalyst.\n\nThe primary driver for DELL stock is the growing demand in the AI server market. Alongside Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), it is one of the key players in this market. On that note, Evercore ISI believes it has won a substantial contract to supply Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with AI servers.\n\nDue to the soaring AI server demand, analysts are bullish. Dell Technologies exited Q4 fiscal year 2024 with a $2.9 billion backlog. Based on growing demand, analysts at Bernstein think AI server revenues could exceed $9 billion in fiscal year 2025.\n\nAnother catalyst for Dell Technologies will be an upgrade cycle triggered by the launch of AI PCs. Anticipating the opportunity, Dell Technologies has launched a comprehensive portfolio of Copilot+ AI PCs. Furthermore, it will profit as partners like Microsoft introduce their versions of AI PCs.\n\nRegarding valuation, DELL stock is still one of the best AI stocks to buy. At under 19 times forward EPS, there is significant upside.\n\nMicron Technologies (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThis memory maker is also soaring on the demand from AI. Micron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU) is famous for its non-volatile flash memory (NAND) and Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) offerings. However, its innovation in high bandwidth memory makes it one of the top AI stocks to buy.\n\nIndeed, HBM has emerged as a key component in AI chipset architectures. In this area, Micron Technologies has emerged as a leader with superior technology. The memory chip producer is applying thermos-compression nonconducting film technology that has improved thickness consistency, packing density and spacing.\n\nIts latest HBM3E memory is seeing significant demand and gaining market share against competitors like SK Hynix and Samsung. Furthermore, due to constrained capacity, pricing will be favorable going forward. Already, Micron Technology has started producing HBM3E chips and management has stated that they will be sold out for 2024 and most of 2025. Moreover, due to the tight prices, they think prices could move higher.\n\nSo far, demand is positively impacting results. Results for Q2 of fiscal year 2024 showed revenues rose 58% year-over-year (YOY) to $5.82 billion. Moreover, management raised the Q3 guide to $6.6 billion above the $6 billion consensus. Indeed, the fundamental momentum is in full swing, and MU stock is a top AI stock.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the major alternative to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the AI GPU market, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) remains one of the top AI stocks to buy. It\u2019s a compelling buying opportunity after a pullback from above $220 to below $180.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the bull case for AMD stock? The semiconductor company is seeing soaring demand for its MI300 AI accelerators. Management expects to achieve at least $4 billion in AI accelerator sales in the calendar year 2024.\n\nHowever, this accounts for just 3% of the market share. According to Bloomberg, the AI training and inference market will grow from $94 billion in 2024 to $640 billion by 2032, representing a 27% compounded annual growth rate. So, analysts expect sustained revenue growth and market share gains from a relatively smaller base compared to Nvidia.\n\nFurthermore, Advanced Micro Devices will profit from the transition to AI PCs. Microsoft recently announced its AI PCs and highlighted the chip maker as one of its partners. This means that its chips for desktops and laptops will experience growing demand.\n\nIn summary, AMD stock has two AI opportunities: in the data center and through AI PCs. At 10 times forward sales, it trades at a significant discount to Nvidia\u2019s 20 times and is a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "There should be nothing special about stocks at a 52-week high. Obviously the milestone indicates business has been good and likely will be better in the future. The market is signaling confidence the stock will continue to outperform. And studies suggest that thinking may be right.\n\nOne said \u201cthat nearness to the 52-week high is a better predictor of future returns than are past returns.\u201d It discovered that stocks trading at or very near their peak end up continuing on their way as the good news that propelled them higher is proven true. The same is true in reverse. Stocks at or near their lows also continue falling.\n\nYet it is not universal. Movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was recently very close to its 52-week low and suddenly spiked 78% higher because Reddit star Roaring Kitty posted a meme on X (formerly Twitter). It had nothing to do with the theater chain or its business. It was just overexuberant traders piling into a meme stock. Of course, AMC has since collapsed again, losing a third of its value in just a week, but it remains almost 2x above where it was trading before the meme post.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks can also fall from their highs after hitting a high note. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) was at a 52-week high before earnings and it is now 27% below those levels on fears of slowing growth.\n\nThe three companies below are stocks at a 52-week high. Will they be like most that continue on their upward trajectory or will they crash and burn? Let\u2019s look closer at each to find out.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nUtilities are not considered artificial intelligence (AI) stocks but that may soon change. The growth of data centers and the role AI plays in their proliferation positions the industry for tremendous future gains. NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) could be one of the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nBecause AI is an energy hog, demand for more and cheaper energy solutions will rise. That favors utilities in the southeast where electricity costs are lower than in much of the rest of the country. And those utilities investing heavily in renewable sources should edge out the competition. That\u2019s why Florida-based NextEra is a uniquely formidable competitor.\n\nNextEra has invested over $206 billion into its regulated and renewable energy projects since 2001. It is the world\u2019s largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a top-tier stock in battery storage. Of the approximate 65 gigawatts (GW) of energy capacity in its portfolio, 36 GW are from renewable sources. And it keeps adding to it each quarter. It currently has about 3.5 GW of data center capacity and another nearly 3.5 GW in its backlog. It also has a pipeline of 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage in various stages of development.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith NextEra Energy stock at a 52-week high, there\u2019s no reason it won\u2019t power higher in the future.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother AI stock that comes out of left field is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). While the movie streamer\u2019s ability to raise prices and operate at a global scale make it the \u201cgold standard\u201d in the industry (that\u2019s what Disney (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger called it), Wall Street thinks AI is what truly sets it apart. Or will.\n\nBecause Netflix is a tech-centric business, Needham analysts say AI will heavily influence its ability to create and collate content though it is already present in how it recommends content to viewers. Netflix says it also uses machine learning to drive content demand modeling and delivery caching.\n\nYet Netflix stock at a 52-week high is a result not so much of AI technology but its ability to outperform expectations. Last quarter it brought on 9.3 million new subscribers, far surpassing the 5.2 million analysts expected.\n\nWall Street now sees Netflix breaking through the $700 per share threshold (boy, did I ever get that wrong!). Trading at around $645 per share, it is already within striking distance. And with analysts forecasting 28% long-term annual growth in earnings its current high-point could soon seem quaint.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt least I got MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) right. One of the first stock picks I made last year for InvestorPlace was the leading Latin American e-commerce and fintech stock. It is witnessing superlative growth in sales and volume and MercadoLibre stock is up 10% in 2024. It stands 30% higher over the past year.\n\nThe company\u2019s e-commerce platform saw gross merchandise volume (GMV) surge 20% in the first quarter to $11.3 billion while its MercadoPago fintech solution enjoyed 35% growth in total payment volume (TPV) to $40.7 billion. The number of monthly active users of the fintech platform also soared 36% higher to 49 million.\n\nMy call on the stock was a bet on the growth of emerging market economies. Brazil and Mexico are MercadoLibre\u2019s two largest markets. GMV grew 30% year-over-year in each while assets under management on the fintech side more than doubled in each country.\n\nWith Wall Street forecasting 35% long-term growth in earnings and the stock trading at less than twice that rate, MercadoLibre stock could be hitting new 52-week highs for some time to come.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When we think about the major indexes, we usually think of the NASDAQ, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But if you want a full picture of the US stock market, you should also include the Russell 2000. This is the index that holds 2000 of the top American small-cap stocks, and sifting through it can be incredibly beneficially to finding small-cap gems to round out your portfolio. Likely, you have probably seen it mentioned by its ticker symbol IWM, which is the ETF that tracks the index.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar or still apprehensive about IWM, it is worth noting that in his most recent 13 F, Stanley Druckenmiller, considered to be one of the greatest investors ever, disclosed a bullish position in IWM call options with a notional value of $664 million. In other words, he thinks small-caps are about to rip higher! For investors looking to get a piece of this growth, here are three stocks from the Russell 2000 worth considering in May 2024!\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been one of the hottest chip stocks in 2024. The company has enjoyed its close relationship with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) during the surge in AI chips and infrastructure demand. Analyst price targets are all over the map for this stock, ranging from $285.00 to over $1500.00. Overall though, the average price target of $1,057.46 confidently represents a near 20% upside from today\u2019s price.\n\nSo far in 2024, shareholders of SMCI have seen a return of a whopping 211%. Given that Wall Street expects AI demand to be a global secular trend for the next decade, it\u2019s easy to see why stocks like SMCI are getting love from investors. After all, SMCI\u2019s high-performance server and storage solutions have been crucial in powering cloud computing, enterprise data centers, 5G computing, and more!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter gaining over 200% this year, many investors might think SMCI is overvalued. Surprisingly, the stock trades at just 4.3x sales and 24.5x forward earnings. It has also grown its net income at a CAGR of 70% over the past five years and a staggering 126% over the past three. With new products such as GB200 set to to continue expanding SMCI\u2019s rack-scale plug-and-play as well, investors can be confident that SMCI will continue being in demand!\n\nCleanSpark (CLSK) In this photo illustration, the CleanSpark (CLSK) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) is a Bitcoin mining company making headlines this year. As the crypto bull run continues, CleanSpark and other miners should benefit from a renewed interest in Bitcoin. Analysts are bullish too. Currently, Wall Street\u2019s lowest price target is $20.00, about 25% higher than today\u2019s price. The highest price target? A whopping $30.00 nearly 100% higher than the current price of $16.03.\n\nStory continues\n\nA lot of people see the word crypto and run. However, Bitcoin has managed to transcend the barriers of traditional finance to make real-world applications thanks to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs this year. While many critics say Bitcoin mining still poses threats to the environment, CleanSpark has been pioneering a path toward more sustainable solutions. Already, for example, its mining operations have been 90% powered by carbon-free power sources!\n\nShares of CLSK trade at about 9.2x sales and 30.8x forward earnings, in line with other major Bitcoin miners. With Bitcoin potentially targeting $100,000 this year, Cleanspark offers investors a cheap, and environmentally friendly way to jump in on this hot crypto bull rally.\n\nMagnite (MGNI) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMagnite (NASDAQ:MGNI) is a sell-side advertisement tech platform that joined the Russell 2000 in 2022. According to Wall Street price targets, the stock is currently heavily undervalued. The lowest price target for MGNI is $13.00 which still represents a 10% upside. Additionally, its highest price target of $20.00 offers more than a 60% upside compared to today\u2019s price.\n\nThe most recent quarter proved to be beneficial for Magnite as the company topped revenue estimates and saw its stock gain more than 10%. But that wasn\u2019t the only catalyst for Magnite. The company announced an exclusive partnership with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as the only sell-side ad company. Analysts expect Netflix to become Magnite\u2019s biggest customer by the end of 2025.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been an easy couple of years for MGNI shareholders. Luckily, the depressed price has presented a discounted buying opportunity at just 2.5x sales and 11x forward earnings. This, of course, has been accompanied by a strong 37% revenue compound annual growth rate! As Netflix comes on board in mid-2025, investors should look to buy this company before its growth balloons.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock fell in Thursday's trading. The server specialist's share price closed out the daily session down 3%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock had been up as much as 11.3% early in the day's trading.\n\nWhile there wasn't any business-specific news powering Supermicro's initial gains today, investors poured into the stock following Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) strong first-quarter results. But bullish momentum receded, and the gains didn't hold.\n\nVolatility hits Supermicro stock after Nvidia's Q1 report\n\nSupermicro purchases graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia and uses them as key components in the servers that it sells. These servers have been in high demand as companies have moved to rapidly deploy and scale artificial intelligence (AI) software.\n\nNvidia reported first-quarter results after the market closed yesterday and once again posted results that crushed the market's expectations. The AI leader reported non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $6.12 on sales of $26.04 billion. Meanwhile, an average of analysts surveyed by the London Stock Exchange Group had suggested that the business would post adjusted earnings of $5.59 per share on sales of $24.65 billion.\n\nNvidia has become the clearest and most intensely monitored bellwether for the state of the AI industry. The company's high-performance GPUs are the foundational hardware that has helped pave the way for the creation and scaling of today's most advanced and most popular artificial intelligence software. Some investors may have been expecting Nvidia's results to drive a bigger pop for Supermicro stock, and it looks like a sizable number of shareholders opted to take profits as momentum started to waver.\n\nAfter a massive run, is Supermicro stock still a buy?\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock has skyrocketed roughly 414% over the last year even after today's slight pullback. With the stock currently trading at roughly 36 times this year's expected earnings, some solid growth is already priced into the server specialist's share price. SMCI Chart\n\nOn the other hand, the business has also been serving up stellar sales and earnings growth. There are also good reasons to think that the artificial intelligence revolution is still in very early innings.\n\nFor risk-tolerant investors seeking long-term plays in the AI space that still have the potential to deliver strong returns, I think that Supermicro stock is still a worthwhile buy. The potential for competitive and macroeconomic pressures to create valuation volatility is certainly here, but the company has strong tailwinds at its back.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The shares of Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) and\u00a0while Super Micro Computer Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:SMCI) are moving in opposite directions today, after surging earlier following Nvidia's (NVDA) blowout quarterly earnings report. Below, let's dig deeper into each stock's performance.\n\nDELL is up 3.4% at $152.73 at last check, and earlier hit an all-time high of $162.71. The security is also on track for a record close and third consecutive daily gain, after Evercore ISI added it to its tactical outperform list amid news that the tech company formed a cloud transformation partnership with Ericsson. So far in 2024, the stock has doubled in value.\n\nDespite rising earlierin the session, SMCI was last seen down 2% to trade at $855.89. Support stemming from the 20-day moving average looks ready to contain these losses, but the $1,000 level remains as a ceiling. Plus, the stock still boasts a 418.3% year-over-year lead.\n\nOptions traders are targeting both equities today. DELL has seen 112,000 calls and 56,000 puts cross the tape so far today -- five times the intraday average volume -- with the weekly 5/24 160-srike call standing out as the most popular contract.\n\nFor SMCI, 181,000 calls and 139,000 have been exchanged, or double the volume typically seen at this point, with the weekly 5/24 1,000-strike call seeing the most activity.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Soared on Thursday Morning",
        "content": "Shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) soared as much as 11.3% higher on Thursday morning, following a fantastic earnings report by chip designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Supermicro investors saw Nvidia's success story as a good sign, since high demand for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chips translates into strong sales of custom AI-crunching computers.\n\nThe enthusiasm faded somewhat later in the day, and Supermicro's stock was up by 2.1% at 1 p.m. ET. Any uptick after a 52-week gain of 438% looks like good news, though.\n\nNvidia's market-moving results\n\nThe leader in AI chip design saw sales rise 262% year over year to $26 billion. Its data center segment's revenue surged even faster, clocking a 427% gain over the same period.\n\nThat unbroken market momentum is good news for Supermicro, since a pile of Nvidia chips or Blackwell AI accelerator cards won't train any AI systems. You need a properly integrated computer system to train them, and Supermicro's products fit the bill for many AI giants.\n\nWhy didn't Supermicro stay aloft today?\n\nSupermicro reported its own results for the comparable period two weeks ago, tripling its top-line sales and skyrocketing even faster on the bottom line. Clever investors can see Supermicro's reports as a bellwether of what Nvidia might be up to.\n\nThat being said, I'm not surprised to see Supermicro's Nvidia-based gains fade out. Again, the company's own results already pointed in this direction, and Wall Street has had plenty of time to price Supermicro's stock accordingly.\n\nOn that note, Nvidia's growth might be exciting, but Supermicro is matching it step for step -- and at a much milder stock valuation. Nvidia shares are changing hands at 33 times sales and 62 times earnings today, while Supermicro's valuation ratios stop at 4.4 and 50, respectively. So if you're looking for a high-octane AI stock at a more modest price level than Nvidia, Supermicro could fit the bill.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $581,764!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "If you\u2019re wondering which tech stocks to buy this month, look no further. Technology stocks continue to offer investors big growth opportunities. While the market rally is broadening out, tech stocks are still leading with outsized gains. And it is not just the mega-cap technology companies known as the Magnificent 7 where opportunities are to be found. A range of different technology stocks are providing shareholders with market beating returns.\n\nCatalysts such as artificial intelligence (AI), a rebound in online advertising, the popularity of streaming, demand for microchips and semiconductors, and the resurgence of cryptocurrencies are propelling stocks of technology companies to new heights. While there are other sectors to invest in, none have provided as much consistent growth as tech stocks since we emerged from the 2008-09 financial crisis 15 years ago.\n\nHere are seven tech stocks that could be millionaire-makers: May edition.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Dell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) have doubled in the last six months and continue to run hot. DELL stock recently closed at an all-time high on expectations that the company will see exponential growth from sales of both AI laptop computers and servers. The company run by founder Michael Dell has emerged as a leader in the AI sector. In the last 12 months, the company\u2019s share price has risen 211%.\n\nThe most recent boost to Dell stock came after investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) raised its price target on the shares and forecast that the company would get a sizable revenue boost from sales of servers that run AI applications. Morgan Stanley expects about $10 billion of AI server revenue from Dell in the company\u2019s current fiscal year that ends in February 2025.\n\nThe bank lifted its price target on DELL stock to $152 a share from $128 previously and named the company a \u201ctop pick\u201d in the technology sector.\n\nReddit (RDDT) In this photo illustration the Reddit logo seen displayed on a smartphone and on the background. RDDT and the Reddit IPO\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of social media company Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) have moved higher based on two recent catalysts. Most recently, RDDT stock increased 11% on news that it has struck a partnership with leading AI start-up OpenAI. The OpenAI partnership is expected to attract more users to Reddit\u2019s social media platform with AI-enhancements and increased advertising. OpenAI has committed to becoming an advertising partner of Reddit, which runs online message boards, including the popular WallStreetBets site.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecondly, Reddit, which held its initial public offering (IPO) at the end of March this year, got a boost after the company issued its first earnings report as a public company. RDDT stock jumped 15% higher after the concern reported a better-than-expected loss per share of $8.19, which was not as bad as a loss of $8.71 that was expected among analysts. Sales in the quarter totaled $243 million, which was much better than consensus forecasts of $212.8 million. Reddit said its sales rose 48% from a year earlier.\n\nRDDT stock is now up 30% since its market debut two months ago.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of technology giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also trading at an all-time high, having risen 35% in the last two months. GOOGL stock has caught fire on growing evidence that the company is reasserting its dominance in the field of AI. Alphabet just held its annual I/O developer conference where it unveiled a host of new AI innovations, winning praise from analysts and investors.\n\nAlso in recent weeks, Alphabet declared its first ever dividend payment alongside blowout first-quarter earnings. The technology giant will pay a cash dividend of 20 cents per share starting on June 17. The company also announced a new $70 billion stock buyback program. The company had $108 billion of cash at the end of Q1. The dividend and share repurchases were announced alongside Q1 results that crushed forecasts, boosted by a resurgence in online advertising.\n\nGOOGL stock is now up 42% over the past 12 months.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere\u2019s currently a buy-the-dip opportunity with the stock of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The shares have pulled back in recent weeks and are currently trading 25% below their 52-week high. The drawdown comes following explosive growth in SMCI stock. In the last 12 months, the company\u2019s share price has risen 457%. And that\u2019s after the current pullback is factored in. So far in 2024, SMCI stock has more than tripled.\n\nThe growth in Super Micro Computer\u2019s stock was big enough to get it added to the benchmark S&P 500 index. The current dip in SMCI stock comes after the company reported year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of 200% for Q1 of this year. Super Micro Computer also raised its forward guidance. But none of that seemed to be enough to impress investors.\n\nThe maker of high-efficiency servers that run AI applications, and Dell competitor, has seen its share price increase more than 4,500% in the last five years.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Coinbase Global (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) has gained 45% year-to-date as prices for digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) have come roaring back. COIN stock is now up 274% over the last 12 months, having surged after the company\u2019s Q1 earnings print. Coinbase reported EPS of $4.40, which was 303% higher than the $1.09 expected among analysts.\n\nRevenue in the January through March quarter totaled $1.64 billion versus $1.34 billion that was expected on Wall Street. Coinbase Global, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., said the results were due to a big rise in crypto trading during Q1 as the price of Bitcoin reached a record high of just under $74,000 in March. Consumer transaction revenue on the exchange during this year\u2019s first quarter was up more than 100% from a year ago.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) have more than doubled over the last 12 months as the audio streaming company controls costs and posts strong financial results. So far in 2024, SPOT stock has gained 62%. The share price really took off after the company announced Q1 earnings that beat expectations across the board despite user growth at the music and podcast streaming platform missing lofty Wall Street forecasts.\n\nSpotify CEO Daniel Ek has called 2024 a \u201cyear of monetization.\u201d In recent months, Spotify has raised prices on individual streaming plans in the U.S. for the first time since 2011 and cut 17% of its global workforce, equal to about 1,500 employees. The cost controls and price increases have had a positive impact on Spotify\u2019s financial results. The company now has 615 million monthly active users on its streaming platform, and growing.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBritish chipmaker Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) has only been publicly traded since last fall, but its stock is benefitting from multiple catalysts. The company recently announced that it plans to launch its first AI-specific microchip in 2025, marking its first foray into the development of AI chips. Arm plans to establish an AI microchip division and will build a prototype chip by early next year.\n\nProduction on the new AI chip is expected to begin in fall 2025. Currently, Arm focuses on making chips and semiconductors that are used in smartphones. Secondly, the company has reported a string of strong quarterly prints since going public last September. Arm recently announced fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $928 million, a 47% increase from a year ago. Arm\u2019s royalty revenues grew 37% YOY to $514 million, a record amount. In terms of profit, Arm earned 36 cents a share, beating forecasts of 31 cents.\n\nARM stock has increased 90% since its IPO less than a year ago.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL.

        "title": "Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In Super Micro Computer, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SMCI) Stock?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 22% over the last month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Super Micro Computer's  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Super Micro Computer is:\n\n21% = US$1.0b \u00f7 US$5.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.21 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE\n\nTo start with, Super Micro Computer's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 8.9% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Super Micro Computer's exceptional 55% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Super Micro Computer's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 30%. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is SMCI worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SMCI is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Super Micro Computer Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nSuper Micro Computer doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Super Micro Computer's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

        "content": "If you\u2019re looking to take a new position in your portfolio in tech stocks, there\u2019s no time like the present. In fact, perhaps you\u2019re a little late to the game. But late is better than never when it comes to finding the top tech stocks to buy.\n\nTech stocks are driving the stock market and have done so for the last year. The growth of generative AI launched a revolution in tech stocks, as many companies are looking for new ways to incorporate AI in their platforms.\n\nFor tech stocks, there\u2019s a lot more to consider than just AI. Tech stocks also represent companies that are involved in hardware, software, cybersecurity, renewable energy technology and communications.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are companies that must be consistently innovating and growing to stay ahead of the curve. And that could lead to significant returns for investors.\n\nTech stocks are appealing because the companies they represent are deft at adapting and pivoting in response to market demands and technological advancements. While they can sometimes be volatile, top tech stocks trend higher over the long term, so it makes sense to take a new position in some top-rated names.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader is our guide in finding the best tech stocks to buy, based on their earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and momentum. If you don\u2019t already have a stake in these names, this could be an ideal time to make an initial investment.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

If anything NVDA stock will be gathering momentum for another move higher.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 came out after the closing bell on May 22 and once again blew away expectations. Revenue was $26 billion, up 18% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and up 262% from a year ago. Data center revenue was $22.6 billion, up 427% from a year ago.\n\nNvidia also declared a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 7, that will make the stock even more enticing to retail investors.\n\nNVDA stock is up 89% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIn many ways, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) works hand-in-hand with Nvidia.\n\nWhile Nvidia makes the powerful GPUs that are so popular these days, Supermicro handles the server architecture and custom bundling that is so essential to allow GPUs to work with each other to perform rapid calculations.\n\nThat\u2019s why SMCI stock has been on such an impressive run, up more than 200% so far this year.\n\nBut SMCI is also on sale \u2014 incredibly, the stock is down 20% from its April highs as investors speculated SMCI has gone up too fast, too quickly.\n\nThat\u2019s just shortsighted thinking. Supermicro earnings have tripled from a year ago and its earnings per share are up fourfold. And as Nvidia continues to roll out upgraded GPUs, Supermicro\u2019s server architecture will continue to be in demand.\n\nSCMI stock gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is looking a lot better today than it was in late 2022. That\u2019s when META stock hit a low as engagement and monthly active viewers were on the decline.\n\nMeta seemed to be more interested in the internet of the future \u2014 the metaverse \u2014 than the here and now.\n\nGranted, being a forward-thinking company is important in the tech realm. But Meta was dumping billions into building out the metaverse and hemorrhaging stock price.\n\nFortunately, CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared that 2023 would be a year where Meta would focus on profits and what makes the company successful.\n\nAnd it worked. META stock is up 91% in the last 12 months, and the company is capitalizing on AI to make advertising more effective.\n\nIt\u2019s also creating some interested generative AI products that improve the user experience for its Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp platforms.\n\nNow Meta Platforms counts roughly half the global population \u2014 nearly 4 billion people \u2014 as active monthly users. And META stock is once again one of the best tech stocks to buy. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) In this photo illustration, the Truth Social logo seen displayed on a smartphone with a photo of former US President Donald Trump displayed in the background. DJT stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nI understand the skepticism that you may feel with this pick. But let\u2019s make a couple of things clear. First, investing in Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) isn\u2019t an endorsement of Donald Trump\u2019s policies or actions, nor is it a bet that he will win the November election.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s important to know that Trump Media is a highly speculative stock that is highly susceptible to the headlines of the day. It\u2019s not a trade for everyone.\n\nBut if you ignore the drama that surrounds Trump Media, you\u2019ll see that this is a trade about possibilities, not politics. X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and now held privately by Elon Musk, is not the powerhouse that it used to be.\n\nThere is a real opportunity for an alternative to step forward \u2014 which is what Meta Platforms did with its Threads platform.\n\nRight now, Trump Media isn\u2019t even close to making money. It will take a long time for it to scale and generate a profit.\n\nBut it may be worth a small, speculative investment today. The stock continues to have a lot of momentum behind it, which is why it still gets an \u201cA\u201d in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is pretty much the polar opposite of\u00a0 Trump Media, which goes to prove that top-rated tech stocks to buy come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nWhile Trump Media is a startup, Dell is a legacy hardware company that makes desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.\n\nBut Dell isn\u2019t acting like a legacy computer company. It\u2019s one of the hottest tech stocks in the market today, with gains of 91% so far in 2024. Investors are jumping all over DELL stock because of the company\u2019s large server business and the potential for companies to upgrade their servers to run AI applications.\n\nDell recorded fourth-quarter revenue of $22.3 billion, down 11% from a year ago. But net income of $1.15 billion was an increase of 91% from last year, and earnings per share of $1.59 was a big improvement from EPS of 84 cents in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nDELL stock is worth taking a position. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother legacy computing company that\u2019s acting more like a young pup than a grizzled hound is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)\n\nLike Dell, IBM is leaning heavily into AI to help power its profits. The company operates its watsonx generative AI platform and has booked more than $1 billion in business related to generative AI. Its software revenue was up 6% in the first quarter of 2024, and overall revenue was up 3%.\n\nIBM is also working on some new AI assistants that are scheduled to be available later this year, and it has partnerships with some of the biggest companies in the world to make watsonx widely accessible.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re an income investor, you have to appreciate IBM\u2019s dividend yield of nearly 4%.\n\nIBM stock is up 5% in 2024 and is recovering nicely from a pullback in April. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf the technology stocks on this list, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is the only that can be classified as a fintech stock.\n\nCoinbase operates a cryptocurrency trading platform that makes nearly 250 different types of assets available for buying, selling or trading.\n\nAnd even if you aren\u2019t interested in investing in cryptocurrency yourself, buying COIN stock allows you to monetize the growth of digital currency and the evolution of blockchain technology.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $1.58 billion, up from $736 million a year ago. The company also turned a profit of $1.17 billion after losing $79 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company managed to top expectations by boasting $511 million in subscription and services revenue, after forecasting a range between $410 million and $480 million.\n\nCOIN stock is up 31% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article both had long positions in NVDA and SCMI. They did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Shares in global chipmakers have continued to move higher presenting some compelling chip stocks to buy. This is amid a more favorable macro backdrop and unprecedented demand for high-end chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) apps. The investment appeal of these stocks received a notable boost after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturing company, reported April revenue up nearly 60% from the same period last year.\n\nThis marks the most substantial growth rate for the year 2024 thus far. TSMC is a crucial supplier for tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). It has a strong performance signaling anticipated growth in customer operations.\n\nChip stocks maintain a favorable outlook on the risk-reward potential for global semiconductor stocks. Here, we look at three chip stocks to buy that are considered safe bets in the chipmaking sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Stock Is a Winner With Big Upside Potential\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading global technology company and one of the top chip stocks to buy. The company designs, develops and supplies various semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Known for its extensive product portfolio, Broadcom\u2019s offerings encompass data center networking, broadband access, software, and wireless connectivity.\n\nMost recently, Barclays initiated coverage on Broadcom with a positive outlook, assigning an Overweight rating and a price target of $1,405. The brokerage firm highlighted that Broadcom is leading in the data center silicon market and poised to benefit from the burgeoning advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBroadcom\u2019s inclusion in Barclays\u2019 list of preferred names for the year stems from its robust data center silicon portfolio. Despite the semiconductor industry\u2019s susceptibility to cyclical downturns, the company\u2019s growing software business is recognized as a pivotal element in bolstering profitability and free cash flow.\n\nBarclays\u2019 attention to AI\u2019s potential is timely. The firm anticipates a mid to high-20% growth rate for Broadcom next year. This surge will continue over the long haul, fueled by the company\u2019s expertise in custom silicon and switching solutions.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a leading global innovative memory and storage solutions provider. Micron\u2019s product portfolio includes DRAM, NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory, integral to advanced computing, mobile applications and data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s stock has surged on robust demand for high bandwidth memory this year. Micron is the supplier of these chips, alongside Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix\u2019s (OTC:HXSCL). Along these lines, Baird analysts recently upgraded their rating on Micron stock.\n\nThe brokerage firm cited significant growth opportunities for the company in the face of increasing demand for AI applications. The firm changed its rating from Neutral to Outperform. It\u2019s anticipating substantial upside potential for the United States\u2019 largest memory chip manufacturer.\n\nThe upgrade comes after Baird analysts researched the semiconductor industry, identifying positive trends in the Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) market that could benefit Micron. According to Baird, recent checks within the channel have revealed an outlook for memory that could be favorable over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nAdditionally, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has recognized the strong performance and market position of Micron. It has upgraded its rating from \u201cUnderweight\u201d to \u201cEqualweight\u201d and substantially increased its price target from $98 to $130 \u2014 an increase of over 32%.\n\nBaird\u2019s report highlighted that DRAM prices surpass expectations, which could lead to constrained industry-wide supply growth. They expect the growth to slow to low single digits quarter-over-quarter in the latter half of 2024.\n\nThis slowdown is partly due to capacity shifts toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM). It is expected to enter a new supercycle that could significantly enhance Micron\u2019s gross margins. The investment firm pointed out Micron\u2019s production of HBM3E, the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory. It has the potential to achieve over 60% gross margin.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website.

(NASDAQ:SMCI), known as Supermicro, is a global leader in high-performance, high-efficiency server technology and innovation. The company provides advanced server solutions, storage systems, and cloud computing technologies.\n\nWall Street analysts recently highlighted SMCI as one of the top chip stocks to buy, describing the stock as the \u201cSwitzerland of AI\u201d following the company\u2019s announcement of another set of strong quarterly results. Rosenblatt analysts, known for their expertise on chip stocks, pointed out that the company\u2019s AI dynamics are \u201ca sweet spot for the company\u2019s building block architecture, Green computing, rapid broad platform deployment, and must-have liquid cooling capabilities.\u201c\n\nSimilarly, analysts at Loop Capital reiterated their Buy rating on shares of Super Micro Computer, maintaining a price target of $1,500. The firm anchors its positive stance on the stock in Super Micro\u2019s well-positioned AI dynamics, driven by the company\u2019s building block architecture.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Shares in Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) took a tumble in April, but more recently, they have experienced a partial rebound. Over the past month, Super Micro Computer stock has bounced back by around 30%.\n\nNow encountering resistance at around $900 per share, the more skeptical may say recent price action has been little more than an example of a \u201cdead cat bounce,\u201d or a short-lived rally doomed to be followed up by another wave of price declines.\n\nOf course, anything\u2019s possible. However, we don\u2019t expect a continued reversal for the AI server company\u2019s shares. Disregard further weakness, considering recent developments and upcoming catalysts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA full move back to prior price levels appears much more likely for SMCI. Here\u2019s why.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Stock: Why it\u2019s Bouncing Back\n\nAs discussed in prior Super Micro coverage, the aforementioned tanking for shares first took shape when the market read too much into the fact that the company did not release preliminary results ahead of earnings.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t as if shares fell before earnings, before rallying upon the release of the results themselves.\n\nInstead, after recovering somewhat from the pre-earnings pullback, Super Micro Computer stock sold off again after the April 30 earnings release. Mostly, due to investors focusing on the one major negative aspect to the latest results: a miss on revenue.\n\nNevertheless, since the earnings release, SMCI has moved back to higher prices. At present, it\u2019s back to where it was just before the pre-earnings plunge.\n\nSo, what\u2019s driving this rebound? While not certain, it may be the fact that recent developments signal that spending on AI infrastructure like servers and hardware isn\u2019t slowing down.\n\nPer a recent forecast from analysts at Bernstein, big tech capital expenditure could total $200 billion this year, with much of this figure going into the buildout of AI capability. With this, investors may be reassessing the situation with Super Micro, becoming less inclined to think the worst about future growth.\n\nThe Path Back to Four-Digit Prices\n\nWhile still down from its high water mark, Super Micro Computer stock remains up by more than threefold from where it was at the start of 2024. Yet even with this big jump in price over a relatively short span of time, it\u2019s not as if SMCI sports a nosebleed forward valuation.\n\nAt current prices, shares trade for around 38 times forward earnings. Not only is that a valuation in line with other high profile AI stocks.\n\nIt may even be a more-than reasonable valuation, given the prospect of further elevated revenue earnings growth, albeit at a slower pace than before.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat is, don\u2019t expect further triple-digit year-over-year increases in Super Micro\u2019s revenue and earnings, as seen in SMCI\u2019s most recent quarterly results. However, based on sell-side forecasts for the coming fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, growth from here is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nConsensus calls for revenue to grow by more than 58% in FY2025. Consensus also calls for earnings growth of 41.8%. Even if the company just meets these forecasts, and SMCI experiences some multiple compression, this may prove sufficient to drive shares back to prices well north of $1000 per share.\n\nBottom Line: The Comeback is Just Getting Started\n\nAs has been the case since last month, investors remain somewhat doubtful about Super Micro Computer\u2019s future growth potential. However, not only does the latest on AI hardware demand bolster the argument that elevated growth will persist.\n\nIt\u2019s very possible that consensus for the next fiscal year is conservative. For instance, Super\u2019s competitive advantages, like its strong relationship with leading chip designers, could help it gain further share in a fast-growing market.\n\nBeyond the potential for further super star growth, something else could provide shares a lift. Possible changes in monetary policy later this year could be a boon for growth stocks. If this happens, SMCI could re-rate to the upside.\n\nWith a Super Micro Computer stock comeback still in the early stages, it\u2019s still prime time to add this AI winner to your portfolio.\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in SMCI. Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings, Fed minutes, UK inflation - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Earnings from tech giant Nvidia are in the spotlight Wednesday, as investors look to see whether the stock's elevated valuation can be justified The minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting also loom large, while U.K. inflation fell by less than was expected in April.\n\n1. Nvidia earnings in spotlight\n\nThe day\u2019s highlight is the long-awaited earnings report from semiconductor bellwether Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the close Wednesday, with these numbers widely seen as a barometer for the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm over all-things AI has helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climb close to its all-time high, up more than 12% this year.\n\nNvidia\u2019s earnings are likely to impact the share prices of AI-related companies - such as Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) - but will also have an outsized influence over broader markets given it is now the third-biggest U.S. company by market value, trailing only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nRobust earnings from Nvidia could help justify stock market valuations that have grown stretched in recent months.\n\n\u201cWe expect NVIDIA to beat and raise in the April quarter, albeit not reaching the levels of the January quarter, due to improved supply and anticipated year-over-year deceleration from tougher comparisons,\u201d said analysts at Rosenblatt, in a note dated May 20.\n\n\u201cWe expect volatility into this week\u2019s print but are nonetheless positively biased on a story that is increasingly resonating with the best secular idea in all of technology.\u201d\n\n2. Fed minutes to offer interest rate clues\n\nMinutes from the Federal Open Markets Committee's most recent meeting are due to be released later in the session, and they will be parsed for clues regarding timing and extent of policy-easing this year.\n\nLast week\u2019s cooler-than-expected U.S. CPI release has calmed nerves about the Federal Reserve keeping rates higher for longer, but this release followed the Fed meeting that these minutes represent.\n\nFed officials have continued to warn about inflation risks, creating a degree of uncertainty over when the Fed will start cutting this year, if at all.\n\nFed Governor Christopher Waller on Tuesday said recent economic data indicates the Fed's restrictive policy is working as directed, while Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic said the central bank needs to exercise caution ahead of its first rate cut to lead to pent-up spending and send inflation \"bouncing around.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Futures little changed ahead of Fed minutes\n\nU.S. stock futures traded largely unchanged Wednesday, amid caution ahead of the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting as well as results from market favorite Nvidia.\n\nBy 04:05 ET (08:05 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 13 points, or 0.1%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 2 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 6 points, or 0.1%.\n\nThe main Wall Street indices close higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite registering new record-setting closes.\n\nIn the corporate sector, Nvidia\u2019s numbers will be the highlight, and earnings are also due from the likes of Target (NYSE:TGT), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), TJX (NYSE:TJX) and Raymond James (NYSE:RJF).\n\nElsewhere, Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) stock rose over 6% after the clothing retailer beat expectations on the top and bottom line in its latest quarter, while homebuilder Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) gained 1% after raising its full-year delivery guidance.\n\n4. UK inflation falls by less than expected\n\nInflation in Britain fell by less than expected in April, disappointing investors who were looking for the Bank of England to cut interest rates next month and suggesting that global inflationary pressures may prove tricky to tame.\n\nConsumer prices rose by an annual 2.3%, down sharply from a 3.2% increase in March and its lowest since July 2021 when it stood at 2.0%, the Office for National Statistics said. But still above the 2.1% forecast.\n\nServices inflation - a key gauge of domestically generated price pressure for the BoE - was much higher than expected, at 5.9% from 6.0% in March, above the expected reading of 5.5%.\n\nEconomists had widely expected a sharper drop in inflation, citing a 12% drop in regulated household energy tariffs that took effect last month.\n\nAfter Wednesday's inflation figures for April, there will be a set of official labor market data and May's inflation release before the BoE's next scheduled policy announcement on June 20.\n\nThe Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates this summer, but August is more favored as the start of the cutting cycle, rather than June.\n\n5. Crude fell after US inventories build\n\nCrude prices fell Wednesday, retreating for the third straight session on U.S. interest rates jitters as well as an unexpected build in U.S. inventories.\n\nBy 04:05 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $77.74 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 1.1% to $81.94 per barrel.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday that U.S. oil inventories unexpectedly grew by 2.5 million barrels last week, raising some concerns over sluggish U.S. oil demand, with the upcoming Memorial Day holiday marking the traditional start of the travel-heavy summer season.\n\nOfficial inventory data from the Energy Information Agency are due later in the session.\n\nA string of cautious statements from Federal Reserve officials this week also weighed on sentiment, as markets feared that high-for-longer U.S. rates will eat into demand this year.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia earnings, Fed minutes, UK inflation - what's moving markets\n\nStocks slip on inflation jitters, offsetting Nvidia hopes\n\nChina will control property sector risk, says vice premier\n\nView comments",

        "content": "A lot of great stocks are flying under the radars of investors. There are plenty of lesser known stocks that are growing by leaps and bounds right now. These are stocks of smaller companies that are nevertheless well run, have strong earnings and big catalysts driving them to new heights. They may get little media attention and not be household names, but they can certainly help to boost a portfolio.\n\nSome of these lesser known stocks could even be millionaire-makers given their strong outperformance and potential for continued growth. Such stocks are not always easy to find. But when one of these diamonds in the rough is discovered, they\u2019re worth holding onto for the long haul. Here are three growth stocks that could end up being millionaire-makers: May edition.\n\nIES Holdings (IESC) A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nIES Holdings (NASDAQ:IESC), formerly known as Integrated Electrical Services, is a small company. It employs about 8,000 electricians who wire up everything from houses in subdivisions to high-tech data centers. Currently, IESC stock has a market capitalization of $3.23 billion and is trading at 21 times future earnings estimates. That said, the stock is up 765% in the last five years having more than tripled in the past 12 months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlready in 2024, IES Holdings\u2019 share price has doubled. The company recently reported its latest earnings, and it was a blowout. For what was its fiscal second quarter, IES Holdings\u2019 revenues rose 24% year over year and its operating income jumped 146%. EPS increased from $1.07 last year to $2.29 in fiscal Q2 of this year. IES reported having $106 million in cash on hand and no debt at the end of the quarter.\n\nDespite the company\u2019s incredible success and the huge growth in its share price, no analysts on Wall Street cover IESC stock. Kudos to investor Eddy Elfenbein for drawing attention to the company and stock in his weekly \u201cCrossing Wall Street\u201d newsletter.\n\nVistra Corp. (VST) A Vistra (VST) office on display in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nSource: Konektus Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother industrial stock worth considering is Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST). An electric utility and power producer, Vistra just became the newest stock to join the S&P 500 index, replacing Pioneer Natural Resources, the oil and gas company that was acquired by Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). Vistra\u2019s inclusion in the S&P 500 comes after the company\u2019s share price more than doubled (up 141%) so far this year. Through 12 months, VST stock has risen 275%, giving the company a market capitalization of $32 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlready, VST stock is the second best performer in the S&P 500 index, behind only Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). Key to the company\u2019s success has been expectations that demand for its electricity will grow exponentially alongside energy-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) models and applications. Some media have referred to electricity as the fuel of AI. This narrative is helping to power VST stock to new heights, benefiting the company\u2019s shareholders.\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX) Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocks\n\nSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors worried that they\u2019ve missed out on the monster growth in weight loss drug manufacturers Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) should consider the new kid on the block, Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX). Early data on trials of Viking\u2019s weight-loss medication has some analysts calling it a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d obesity treatment. The hype has VKTX stock up 268% so far this year.\n\nThe market for weight loss medications is forecast to be worth $100 billion by the end of the decade, meaning there\u2019s plenty of room for competition. Viking Therapeutics has emerged as a true contender against both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. While Viking\u2019s weight loss drug is unlikely to receive regulatory approval and come to market until 2027, at the earliest, there might be another reason to buy VKTX stock. Wall Street is abuzz with possible takeover rumors related to Viking Therapeutics.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in LLY. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Ready to Split",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence revolution has caused a growth surge for the technology's enablers, most of which reside in the semiconductor sector.\n\nIn fact, the stock movements for these companies have been so strong that many now trade at very, very high stock prices, setting these AI beneficiaries up for a potential stock split.\n\nStock splits don't create or destroy any value on their own. After all, if a company has twice as many shares but half the stock price, the company's total market cap remains the same. However, stock splits can help certain people afford shares if they don't have a broker that allows fractional share buying. Moreover, splits can increase a stock's liquidity, which can help lower-bid-ask spreads for trading purposes, and therefore attract larger funds to a stock.\n\nTherefore, even though the following five stocks have already had very strong runs, a split could potentially drive these AI winners to even further upside.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nFirst and most obvious on the list is AI GPU leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Not only is Nvidia currently leading the entire AI revolution with its best-in-class AI chips and software ecosystem, but it also has a history of stock splits. While Nvidia split its stock a few times in the early 2000s, its most recent was a 4-for-1 split in July 2021.\n\nOf course, with the stock having quintupled since that split a mere three years ago and its share price reaching $944 as of this writing, it's not a stretch to the think the company may choose to split its stock again.\n\nNvidia anticipated the AI revolution well before other peers did, giving it a long multi-year lead. In fact, Nvidia has been investing in its CUDA software ecosystem since 2006. CUDA allows developers to program Nvidia's graphics processors for data processing, thus enabling AI. Fast forward to the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, and that foresight looks like a stroke of genius. The 17-year head-start on the competition has allowed for some nice network effects, with AI developers building most of their applications with CUDA and making it difficult for competitors to make inroads.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels; last October, management declared it would double the speed at which it introduces a new chip architecture, from once every two years to once per year. On that note, management introduced its new Blackwell architecture in March, which will be hitting the market in late 2024. These new AI chips offer a big leap forward over even the current Hopper architecture, offering 2.5 times the training performance and up to five times the inference performance over its predecessor.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has its Q1 earnings release tomorrow on Wednesday, May 22, and all indicators point to its strong AI-fueled hypergrowth continuing. Will Nvidia split its stock again? Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nOne AI stock that has had even better returns than Nvidia over the past three years is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Sure, a lot of Super Micro's recent success is owed to Nvidia's AI chips, but SMCI's returns in the stock market have actually been far superior. Since July 2021, the last time Nvidia split its stock, Nvidia is up by five times. But Super Micro's stock has increased a whopping 25 times over in less than three years. As a result, Super Micro's stock price has appreciated to about $900 per share as of this writing, setting it up for a potential split.\n\nA good part of that outperformance was a result of Super Micro's starting from a significantly lower valuation. In the past, its server products were thought of as \"commoditized\" with a lot of other competitors in the space.\n\nBut the AI revolution has exposed the business model strengths CEO Charles Liang had been cultivating for 30 years. Architecting its servers out of, \"building blocks,\" or creating the smallest possible modules or server components independently, then being able to build servers out of any combination of these components, Super Micro has mass-customization capabilities that enable it to satisfy virtually any customer modification request. Not only that, but the architecture also saves on costs, as parts of a server can be refreshed instead of having to replace an entire system.\n\nMoreover, Liang has stressed energy-efficiency in its server design for some 20 years, far before it was fashionable. But with the enormous electricity needs and costs of AI servers, Super Micro's efficient designs are finding even more favor today. And with offices right in the heart of Silicon Valley close to Nvidia and other chipmakers, Super Micro is often able to stay ahead of competitors with the latest in-demand features such as liquid cooling, and is often first-to-market with servers containing the latest and greatest chips.\n\nWhile Super Micro's P/E ratio has ballooned from the single digits to 50 over just the past few years, it's also displaying the growth to back it up, with a stunning 200% growth last quarter. As such, I'd expect Super Micro's share price to at least maintain these valuation levels, with a stock split potentially in the cards. Super Micro stock has seen the biggest gains from the AI revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nAnother AI beneficiary is Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), thanks to two main factors. First, Broadcom makes the world's leading networking and routing chips with its Tomahawk and Jericho brands, and data center networking needs are exploding thanks to the data-intensive nature of AI.\n\nSecond, Broadcom has application-specific integrated chip (ASIC) design IP that third parties can use to make AI accelerators. In this area, Broadcom has landed some big fish, with both Alphabet and Meta Platforms using the company's ASICs to design their own in-house AI accelerators.\n\nAs a result of its highly cash-generative business and AI-fueled growth, Broadcom has seen its share price rally to over $1,400 per share. That definitely puts it in the running for a stock-split.\n\nOf course, the AI boost has only been the most recent catalyst pushing Broadcom's stock. Even before the AI revolution, Broadcom was an impressive winner thanks to CEO Hock Tan's visionary acquisition strategy. Over the past 18 years under his tenure, Tan has sought to acquire strong semiconductor franchises, then cutting costs as these defensible niche technologies are folded into the Broadcom corporate umbrella.\n\nThen in 2018, Tan expanded Broadcom's reach when it bought its first software company, California Technologies, diversifying the chipmaker into software, albeit still within its main enterprise infrastructure market. After buying cybersecurity firm Symantec in 2019, Broadcom made its biggest purchase yet in VMware, a software leader that enables hybrid cloud capabilities and data center virtualization. VMware should also benefit from the growth of AI as customers use many clouds with unique capabilities while striving to keep their data safe in their own data centers. As a result of the VMware acquisition, which closed late last year, Broadcom's software mix has grown to roughly 40% of revenues.\n\nNow, Broadcom isn't just a chipmaker, but a diversified technology platform company with many ways to win. Look for its profitable growth to remain strong in the years ahead. Both chipmakers and equipment stocks are all benefiting from the AI revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. ASML Holdings\n\nThe path to making every leading-edge semiconductor, Nvidia GPUs included, runs through ASML Holdings(NASDAQ: ASML). This is because the Netherlands-based lithography company has a monopoly on key extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology needed to make today's most advanced chips.\n\nEUV technology took some 20 years to develop with significant buy-in from ASML's customers to fund leading research, so don't think that EUV capabilities can be copied anytime soon. The resulting technology allows for chipmakers to draw extremely fine transistor designs with light wavelengths that do not occur naturally on earth. And ASML's latest version of EUV, called \"high-NA\" EUV, can print designs down to widths of just 8nm. ASML is set to rake in the dough from high-NA, just introduced late last year, as these machines currently go for between $300 million and $400 million a pop!\n\nEUV only began to be used commercially in 2018, with the first EUV-enabled products coming out in 2019. So, we are still only at the beginning of the EUV era. As such, ASML has seen its stock rocket 367% over the past five years, reaching $940 per share, thus making it a candidate for a stock split.\n\n5. Lam Research\n\nLike ASML, Lam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX) is a semiconductor equipment leader that has also seen shares rally over the semiconductor bull market. But whereas ASML is the de facto leader in lithography, which draws designs on a silicon wafer using extremely fine light, Lam's technology does the exacting and painstaking work of etching the printed design and then depositing semiconductor material in extremely intricate patterns to construct the chip.\n\nWhile Lam doesn't have a clear monopoly over etch and deposition technology like ASML does with EUV, Lam actually does have a monopoly over certain process steps in the chipmaking process. More specifically, Lam dominates the deposition technology crucial to \"stacking\" chip components in a vertical fashion. Over the past decade or so, that has led to Lam benefiting from the production of 3D NAND flash chips, in which memory-makers stack storage modules in a \"3D\" fashion in greater and greater numbers of layers with every generation.\n\nNow, logic and DRAM chips crucial for AI are also \"going vertical,\" including high-bandwidth memory DRAM that is currently seeing such strong demand from AI applications. In fact, on its January conference call with analysts, Lam management noted it had a 100% market share in certain technologies needed for stacking DRAM modules. And with new gate-all-around transistors and 3D designs making their way into logic chips, look for Lam to get a further AI boost in the years ahead.\n\nThat's why shares have rocketed 385% over the past five years to $941 per share as of this writing, setting this strong compounder up for a possible stock split as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "If you\u2019re looking for a profitable summer, then growth stocks should be No. 1 on your priority list. Identifying the best growth stocks to buy \u2013 with the help of tools like the Portfolio Grader \u2013 is a great first step in your investing journey.\n\nGrowth stocks represent companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to others in the market. Investors can expect these companies to reinvest their earnings back into the business \u2013 so there are rarely dividends to speak of \u2013 because the No. 1 priority of these companies is to expand, innovate, or scale up operations.\n\nThey are the opposite of value stocks, which are often mature companies with stable earnings and dividends. And while the best value stocks are priced below their fundamentals, top growth stocks often have high price-to-earnings, price-to sales, or price-to-book ratios. But that\u2019s the trade-off when you\u2019re looking for the best growth stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the stock market often experiences its weakest point in the summer, there\u2019s no reason to avoid investing. In fact, I believe these growth stocks to buy will help you beat the market and make for a profitable summer investing season.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the best growth stocks to buy for months now, and that\u2019s not going to end anytime soon. The semiconductor company is on a massive run as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for their ability to operate generative artificial intelligence applications.\n\nThe most recent win for Nvidia is its new deal with Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), in which the aerospace and defense company will use Nvidia\u2019s AI platform and generative AI software.\n\nNvidia owns roughly 80% of the AI chip market, putting it in a dominant position for years to come. NVDA stock is up 90% this year and is in a position to hit $1,000 per share after it reports earnings on May 22. It gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) isn\u2019t anywhere as big as Nvidia. But it\u2019s still a dynamic growth company that\u2019s using the power of artificial intelligence to see massive gains.\n\nPalantir long made its mark as a defense contractor, using AI and machine learning to provide real-time analysis and predictions to military units in the field.\n\nBut it\u2019s also quickly growing its commercial business through its Artificial Intelligence Platform and its Gotham platform. An important partnership with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) will make those products available through Oracle\u2019s cloud network.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Palantir stock pulled back following its first-quarter earnings report, I see good things ahead for this company.\n\nEarnings were for $634.3 million in revenue, up 21% from a year ago. Palantir projects revenue in the range of $649 million to $653 million for the second quarter and raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $2.677 billion and $2.689 billion.\n\nPLTR stock is up 26% this year and up 128% in the last 12 months. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and an overall rating of \u201cA\u201d in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up.

By investing $13 billion into the company over the years, Microsoft has been in the position of being the first to incorporate the ChatGPT generative AI into its Bing search engine, its Edge browser, and into Microsoft 365 products.\n\nMicrosoft has nicely recovered from its recent dip and the stock is up 11% so far this year. It gets \u201cB\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) a Google Pixel smartphone\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another powerhouse in its own right. With its dominant Google search engine, Chrome browser, and products such as YouTube, Alphabet is in dominant force for both advertisers and content producers.\n\nThe company earned $80.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2024 \u2013 an extraordinary figure \u2013 with $46.1 billion of that coming from Google search advertising.\n\nRevenue was 15% better than last year, with solid year-over-year growth for YouTube advertising and Google search.\n\nThere are some bearish takes that OpenAI, which is the company that brought ChatGPT to life, could roll out a new AI-powered search engine as part of its partnership with Microsoft and that company\u2019s Bing search engine.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has denied there\u2019s an imminent announcement, but rumors persist and it\u2019s having an effect on GOOG shares.\n\nMy advice? Take advantage of the dip should shares of GOOG stock continue to fall. It could be a great opportunity.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you\u2019re bullish about the growth of computing and AI \u2013 and why wouldn\u2019t you be? \u2013 then another growth stock to consider closely is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI).\n\nAfter a huge run in 2023 and early 2024, Supermicro stock has pulled back somewhat, but that looks more like a buying opportunity than anything.\n\nIts earnings report was impressive \u2013 sales tripled from a year ago and earnings per share were up fourfold. Supermicro also increased its guidance from $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion previously, to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion currently.\n\nBut bearish investors ruled the day and SCMI stock dropped 23% following the earnings report.\n\nBut the thesis about Super Micro Computer hasn\u2019t changed. The company will continue to work closely with chip manufacturers like Nvidia to design server architecture to bundle powerful AI chips so they can perform complex tasks.\n\nSMCI stock is up 218% this year, and continues to get \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Virtual character inside a virtual art gallery. Metaverse\n\nSource: MR Neon / Shutterstock\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the social media company that\u2019s behind Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads and WhatsApp.\n\nIt also made waves in recent years by investing billions into the metaverse, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg hopes the future of computing and our online worlds lie.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t share Zuckerberg\u2019s enthusiasm for the metaverse, I can\u2019t help but be impressed with Meta for the staying power of its core products. Meta\u2019s platforms count nearly half of the global population \u2013 almost 4 billion people \u2013 as monthly average users. That\u2019s extraordinary.\n\nAnd the company\u2019s reach and the detailed information it has on its users \u2013 thanks to their users\u2019 profiles and postings \u2013 allows Meta to be highly specific in targeting advertising to people who are most likely to buy. If you\u2019re an advertiser, you\u2019re probably very familiar with Meta\u2019s advertising platform.\n\nMETA stock is up 33% in 2024. It gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a very interesting and innovative company. It has a variety of voice recognition products \u2013 powered by artificial intelligence \u2013 that allow customers to do everything from asking questions about their vehicle maintenance to providing step-by-step training for employees.\n\nEven Nvidia is taking notice. The chipmaker took a stake of its own in the company, and as investors took notice, SOUN stock soared. At one point, shares of SoundHound were up more than 300% this year.\n\nSoundHound reported a strong quarter, with auto units and cloud users expanding by double digits. Revenue was $11.6 million, up 73% from a year ago. The company continued to post losses as it scales, with a net loss of $19.9 million or 7 cents per share.\n\nSOUN stock is up 141% in 2024. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating for growth and a \u201cB\u201d overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR, and MSFT.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nSuper Micro is expected to post earnings of $7.95 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +126.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.51 points to a change of +99.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $34 indicates a change of +44.6% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +17.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Super Micro.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for SMCI _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate of $5.3 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +142.6%. The $14.93 billion and $23.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +109.7% and +60.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +200%. EPS of $6.65 for the same period compares with $1.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.89%. The EPS surprise was +15.05%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "4 Quality Stocks to Bet On DuPont Analysis",
        "content": "Although Wall Street is hovering around a record-high level, concerns regarding a further rally remain. U.S. consumer price inflation cooled in April but despite the moderation, analysts believe that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to rush into cutting interest rates as the central bank will look for more cues regarding the stabilization in the inflation scenario.\n\nMeanwhile, retail sales in April remained unchanged, indicating stressed consumer behavior. As a result, it is intriguing to pick quality stocks at the current level. Upbeat return on equity (ROE) can serve as one such quality measure. Let\u2019s delve a little deeper.\n\nInside the Strength of Return on Equity Measure\n\nReturn on equity (ROE) is one of the most favored metrics of investors. It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.\n\nHowever, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements \u2014 operating management, management of assets and the capital structure \u2014 related to the financial condition of a company. Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:\n\nROE = Net Income/Equity\r\n\r\nNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)\r\n\r\nROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity Multiplier\n\nThe screener yields winning stocks like Casey's General Stores CASY, EMCOR Group EME, Super Micro Computer SMCI and Sprouts Farmers Market SFM.\n\nWhy Use DuPont?\n\nAlthough one can\u2019t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn\u2019t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margins as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.\n\nIn fact, it also sheds light on the company\u2019s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.\n\nSo, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company\u2019s financials.However, looking at the financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\n\u2022 Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management\u2019s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It\u2019s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environments.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low priced stocks. However, when looking for lower-priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.\r\n\r\nHere are all four stocks that made it through the screen:\n\nCasey's General Stores: This Zacks Rank #2 company operates convenience stores under the Casey's and Casey's General Store names in 16 states, mainly Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.

The earnings estimate of Casey's General Stores for the current year is 10.43%.\n\nEMCOR Group: This Zacks Rank #1 company is one of the leading providers of mechanical and electrical construction, industrial and energy infrastructure, as well as building services for a diverse range of businesses.\n\nEMCOR Group serves commercial, industrial, utility and institutional clients. The average earnings surprise of EME for the past four quarters is 31.96%.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: This Zacks Rank #1 company designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.\n\nThe average earnings surprise of SMCI for the past four quarters is 6.96%. The earnings estimate of Super Micro Computer for the current year is 99.07%.\n\nSprouts Farmers Market: This Zacks Rank #1 company operates in a highly fragmented grocery store industry. It has a unique model that features fresh produce, a foods section, and a vitamin department focused on overall wellness.\n\nThe average earnings surprise of SFM for the past four quarters is 9.17%.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Wednesday?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the undisputed beneficiary of recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). Since early last year, the adoption of AI has spread like wildfire, fueled by Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). The company will face a key hurdle when it reports its first-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, and Wall Street will be sitting on the edge of its seat to parse the results.\n\nThe stock has gained an incredible 548% since the start of last year (as of this writing), fueled by strong and accelerating demand for AI. Nvidia has been the unofficial standard bearer of the AI revolution, but investors are beginning to wonder if the trend can continue at its recent breakneck pace.\n\nWith the scene set, should investors buy Nvidia stock before its highly anticipated first-quarter report? Let's examine the available evidence. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA make-or-break quarter?\n\nThe initial excitement has worn off in recent months and investors are no longer taking the AI revolution on faith. Yet, the major cloud services have been vocal about the ongoing demand for generative AI and their plans to boost investment in the space.\n\nMicrosoft increased its capital expenditures by 79% to $14 billion in the calendar first quarter, while Alphabet's spending grew by 90% to $12 billion. Amazon spent $14 billion in the first quarter, which it expects will be the low point of spending for the year, expecting capex spending to \"meaningfully increase\" thanks to AI.\n\nSince data centers and cloud infrastructure providers are among Nvidia's largest customers, that would seem to bode well for the company's upcoming report.\n\nFor its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30), analysts expect Nvidia's sales to surge 277% to $24.6 billion, with earnings per share (EPS) jumping from $0.83 to $4.57.\n\nWhile results of that magnitude might seem unlikely, consider this: in the fourth quarter, Nvidia generated record revenue that jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, and its outlook is calling for Q1 revenue of $24 billion -- and its guidance tends to be conservative.\n\nIs the writing on the wall?\n\nSeveral AI-centric companies have reported results in recent weeks, and the market's reaction has been puzzling, to say the least.\n\nEarlier this month, AI software and data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) reported first-quarter revenue that grew 21% year over year and 4% sequentially to $634 million, while its adjusted EPS jumped 60%. Wall Street found its guidance lacking, however, and the stock fell 15% on the day following its report.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended March 31), chip designer Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) reported revenue that grew 47% year over year to $928 million, while adjusted EPS of $0.36 soared 1,700% (not a typo). Despite the surge in both sales and profits, investors were hoping for more robust guidance, and the stock fell 2% following the release of its results.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), AI-centric server maker Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) delivered record revenue that jumped 200% year over year to $3.85 billion, while adjusted EPS soared 308% to $6.65. Despite raising its guidance, Wall Street wanted more, and the stock tumbled 14% on the day following its report.\n\nEagle-eyed investors will have noticed a pattern emerging. Despite strong, expectation-beating results, Wall Street is looking to the future and taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\nThese results suggest that while demand for AI remains high, investors are not only demanding stellar results but looking for robust guidance to confirm that the secular tailwinds of AI continue to blow.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia stock now or wait until after earnings?\n\nHow you answer this question depends on what type of investor you are. For those looking to buy ownership in a business with a strong track record of execution, savvy management, and technological tailwinds, and have plans to hold it for the long term, then Nvidia might just be the stock for you.\n\nIf, however, you're looking to jump into the stock before earnings in the hopes that it will pop so you can make a quick exit, then Nvidia might end up being a disappointment. Truth be told, there's simply no way to know for sure whether Nvidia stock will go up or down after it reports on Wednesday.\n\nIf I were to hazard a guess, I'm inclined to think that investors continue to underestimate the continuing strong deman for AI and the fundamental changes it will bring to the fore. That said, unless Nvidia significantly boosts its guidance, the stock could tumble.\n\nThat said, Nvidia has shown a knack for skating to where the puck is going rather than where it's been. The company continues to spend heavily on research and development, which amounted to 20% of its 2023 revenue. Nvidia is already working on the next generation of industry-leading AI processors, which is how it stays so far ahead of the competition.\n\nFinally, there's the matter of Nvidia's valuation. At 79 times trailing 12-month earnings, the stock might seem exorbitantly expensive if not for three consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, with another likely on the way. However, Nvidia is selling for 38 times next year's earnings, and while that's a bit on the high side, it's justified by the company's meteoric growth.\n\nHowever, for those looking beyond the current quarter, I believe Nvidia's track record and history of innovations speak for itself, making it a buy for investors intending to hold for years if not decades.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital",
        "content": "If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Super Micro Computer is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.16 = US$1.1b \u00f7 (US$8.9b - US$1.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nTherefore, Super Micro Computer has an ROCE of 16%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 8.3% generated by the Tech industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Super Micro Computer's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Super Micro Computer  for free.\n\nSo How Is Super Micro Computer's ROCE Trending?\n\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Super Micro Computer. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 16%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 585% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Super Micro Computer thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nOn a related note, the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets has decreased to 19%, which basically reduces it's funding from the likes of short-term creditors or suppliers. Therefore we can rest assured that the growth in ROCE is a result of the business' fundamental improvements, rather than a cooking class featuring this company's books.\n\nOur Take On Super Micro Computer's ROCE\n\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that Super Micro Computer is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has returned a staggering 4,360% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer does come with some risks though, we found 4 warning signs in our investment analysis,and 2 of those are concerning...\n\nWhile Super Micro Computer may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "content": "Contrarian investors distinguish themselves in a world where market trends frequently dictate investing strategies by looking for opportunities where others perceive uncertainty. These three chances are available. Even if there may be some doubt about these equities, a further examination reveals solid prospects for future development.\n\nTo begin with, the first company is resilient against market challenges.\u00a0This\u00a0is reflected in its foreign market development and revenue diversification,\u00a0especially\u00a0through international digital commerce. Its smart investments and strong financial performance reflect its ability to prosper in a competitive environment.\n\nMoreover, the second one has solid growth in its direct-to-consumer (D2C) sector. This marks\u00a0a sharp rise in revenue and a steadily expanding subscriber base.\u00a0This\u00a0also indicates the company\u2019s edge in shifting consumers\u2019 preferences. The company may attain long-term growth and has established a solid lead in the streaming sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLastly, the third one may have a\u00a0major\u00a0role in the tech sector\u2019s future because of its technical innovations.\u00a0This\u00a0reflects the improvements in its semiconductor production processes. Significant alliances and recognition also support its legitimacy and long-term success potential.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Why Alibaba Stock Makes Even More Sense to Buy Today. BABA\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba\u2019s (NYSE:BABA) International Digital Commerce (AIDC) reports solid top-line growth. Sales rose 45% year-over-year (YoY). Improvements in the customer experience and the rise of international retail operations are the main drivers of this boost. Indeed, investments in vital markets have accelerated growth and enhanced brand awareness, as shown in Trendyol\u2019s spread throughout the Gulf region.\n\nMoreover, despite market competition, Alibaba had an\u00a08% YoY growth in consolidated revenue in fiscal 2024. A double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income demonstrates solid operational profitability and efficiency. Through its share repurchase program, Alibaba has proved that it\u00a0is focused\u00a0on integrating value growth. In fiscal 2024, the number of outstanding shares reduced by 5.1% YoY. In addition, the business announced $4 billion in cash dividends for 2024.\u00a0Hence, this\u00a0illustrates its sharp cash flow creation and investor-friendly capital allocation moves.\n\nLastly, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s revenue grew by\u00a03% YoY in Q4 2024, mostly from adopting\u00a0AI-related products and high-quality revenues from public cloud usage. The cloud segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA had a noteworthy 45% growth, primarily attributed to enhanced product mix and operational edge.\n\nStory continues\n\nParamount (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, Paramount\u2019s (NASDAQ:PARA) D2C business had a solid 24% YoY top-line growth. Through a boost in subscribers and an uplift in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), Paramount+\u2019s top line surged by 51% YoY. Subscriptions to Paramount+ exceeded 71 million, with a rapid net increase of 3.7 million throughout the quarter. Similarly, the D2C division had a\u00a031% increase\u00a0in advertising income,\u00a0mostly\u00a0due to growth from Pluto TV and Paramount+ and advantages from Super Bowl LVIII. Moreover, new subscriber additions and increases in the price of Paramount+ memberships drove a notable 22% increase in subscription income.\n\nAdditionally, the D2C segment\u2019s robust revenue growth and growing subscriber base highlight Paramount\u2019s progressive\u00a0content distribution tactics and the rising demand for its streaming platforms. The company\u2019s digital advertising environment is attractive, and its monetization initiatives have been successful, as seen by the significant growth in advertising income. Thus, these patterns indicate a positive future for Paramount\u2019s D2C business, with room to grow and diversify income streams.\n\nOverall, the considerable increase in advertising revenue from high-profile events like the Super Bowl reflects the segment\u2019s tremendous commercial attractiveness.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the announcement of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 14A, which uses High NA EUV technology, Intel has made a significant scientific development in the structural evolution of semiconductors. Similarly, H2 2024\u00a0is anticipated\u00a0to see the start of the Intel 20A production ramp, illustrating a steady advancement towards sophisticated semiconductor manufacturing techniques. Moreover, the Intel 18A manufacturing ramp is scheduled to begin in early 2025, with Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake already under fabrication.\n\nFurther, Intel was given the\u00a0largest\u00a0award under the CHIPS and Science Act, with projected grants, tax breaks, and loans totaling more than $45 billion. Intel Vision 2024\u00a0was experienced\u00a0by over 1K esteemed clients and associates. These include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Bosch, Supermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI), and Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY). No doubt, Intel has a lead in the semiconductor industry. Its potential for further expansion\u00a0is highlighted\u00a0by its recognition by the US government as the national semiconductor champion.\n\nIn summary, the partnerships open doors for reaching an expanded target market and boosting sales. Therefore, Intel\u2019s\u00a0clear\u00a0strategy for leading the technological space and growing its market share positions it to take a\u00a0major\u00a0market share in the AI-driven economy.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in BABA, PARA and INTC.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer, C3.ai, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Rallied This Week",
        "content": "There's little question that one of the prevailing forces that has been driving the market higher over the past year is the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). Countering investors' exuberance about the prospects for that technology are concerns about the Federal Reserve's ongoing battle with inflation. Interest rates remain at a two-decade high, and investors are keenly interested in the timing and potential for the central bank to begin cutting them. The central bank has signaled that it's in no rush to reduce the benchmark federal funds rate -- at least, not until inflation subsides sufficiently. The government's latest monthly read on inflation helped fuel investors' hopes, sparking a broad-based market rally.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, AI server specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, surged by 11.2% this week, AI solutions provider C3.ai(NYSE: AI) gained 10.5%, and data mining and analytics provider BigBear.ai(NYSE: BBAI) climbed 8.6%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nA check of all the usual sources -- regulatory filings, earnings results, and changes to analysts' ratings and price targets -- turned up nothing in the way of company-specific news that could have been driving these AI stocks higher this week. This seems to suggest that most investors who were propelling their climbs were giddy about the incremental improvements to the state of the U.S. economy. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPersistent and stubborn inflation\n\nThe latest monthly report on inflation, courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed price growth continuing to cool, a welcome development for weary consumers. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) -- the most widely watched gauge of inflation -- increased by 3.4% in April compared to the year-ago period while edging up just 0.3% month over month.\n\nThe year-over-year increase was in line with economists' expectations, while the monthly increase was marginally better than the consensus estimate of 0.4%. The \"core\" inflation rate, which doesn't include volatile food and energy prices, was up 3.6% compared to this time last year, and up 0.3% from March, both results in line with expectations.\n\nThe Fed's target of 2% inflation remains elusive, but investors are celebrating the incremental improvements.\n\nThe underlying data shows that the Fed still has work to do. While energy prices rose just 1% compared to the year-ago period, shelter prices, primarily composed of rental rates, remained particularly troublesome, up 5.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nInflation has remained stubbornly higher than the Fed's target range over the past couple of months, which decreases the likelihood that it will begin to cut interest rates this year.\n\nNow what\n\nWhat does the broader read on inflation have to do with our trio of AI stocks? Businesses, like consumers, continue to feel the pinch of higher prices, which makes them less likely to take on additional obligations. Even incremental improvements in the big picture spark the hope among investors that businesses will be more willing to spend on new projects -- like the adoption of AI tools to improve their operations. That, in turn, would benefit these three companies.\n\nSuper Micro Computer makes high-end, AI-ready servers that are highly customizable and energy efficient. BigBear.ai's data mining and decision intelligence solutions provide companies with information they can use to make better decisions. C3.ai provides turn-key AI solutions that help businesses adopt AI and quickly get AI-powered applications up and running.\n\nThere is, of course, the matter of valuation to consider. C3.ai, Supermicro, and BigBear.ai currently trade at 7 times, 2 times, and 2 times forward sales, respectively. Furthermore, C3.ai and BigBear.ai aren't profitable, increasing the level of risk. That leaves Supermicro as my uncontested favorite of these three.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 17, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Super Micro Computer SMCI as the Bull of the Day and GameStop GME as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund XLU and Schwab U.S. REIT ETF SCHH.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nSuper Micro Computer reported their March quarterly earnings on April 30 and inspired analysts to once again boost growth estimates for the provider of key datacenter infrastructure in the early innings of the AI boom.\r\n\r\nAfter SMCI delivered strong numbers and guidance, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year (ends June) rose 6% from $22.15 to $23.51, representing 99% annual growth.\r\n\r\nAnd next fiscal year jumped over 17% from $28.95 to $34, which would equate to a 44.6% advance.\r\n\r\nThese rising profits are being drawn from equally impressive growth on the topline, with the current year approaching a 110% leap to nearly $15 billion and next year's projections are stalking $24 billion for another 60% surge.\n\nI Remember Ye Yay High\n\nAs a devoted NVIDIA investor, I like to remind others that \"as goes GPU demand, so goes datacenter build-out.\" And just as investors continue to doubt NVIDIA's growth as having any sustainability, so too they miss its little satellites profiting from the boom.\r\n\r\nIt seems it was only a few months ago when SMCI was a $300 stock. That's because it was only 4 months ago when, in late January, the company pre-announced December quarter results and the stock launched 36% the next day.\r\n\r\nI first wrote about the \"shock and awe\" of a datacenter architect most investors had never heard of in my Bull of the Day from January 28. Here's some of what I shared...\r\n\r\nThey call themselves \"Supermicro\" and describe their business simply and powerfully...\r\n\r\nSupermicro is a global technology leader committed to delivering first-to-market innovation for Enterprise, Cloud, AI, Metaverse, and 5G Telco/Edge IT Infrastructure. We are a Rack-Scale Total IT Solutions provider that designs and builds an environmentally-friendly and energy-saving portfolio of servers, storage systems, switches, software, along with global support services.\r\n\r\nAnd on January 19 they stunned Wall Street with preliminary revenue of $3.6 billion, which tore through prior guidance of $2.7-2.9 billion, representing 100% year-over-year growth for the company's fiscal Q2.\r\n\r\nEarnings for the quarter are projected to spike to $5.55 a share, topping analysts estimates of $4.50 EPS.\r\n\r\nThe company cited strong market and end customer demand for its rack-scale, AI and Total IT Solutions.\r\n\r\nFor its current fiscal year which ends in June, Supermicro is on pace to deliver 53% topline growth to nearly $11 billion and 40% EPS growth to cross $16.50.\r\n\r\nAnd even after the huge rally in SMCI shares this month, with projected 15% revenue growth to cross $12.5 billion next year the stock still trades at only 2 times sales!\r\n\r\n(end of excerpt from my Jan 28 article)\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Boom, or AI Bubble?\n\nWhat should jump out is that less than four months ago we were talking about $11 billion and $12.5 billion on the Supermicro toplines for this year and next. Now those numbers are $15 billion and $24 billion!\r\n\r\nAnd the stock still trades for 2X sales as I talked about in my video from May 7, where I also discuss SMCI volatility since the surge to $1,200 as investors debate whether or not this is all just an \"AI bubble.\"\r\n\r\nIn that video, I explain why SMCI dropped 23% on April 19. The reason revolves around expectations for another stunner preannouncement (like in January) that didn't come. So expectations and fears clashed as hopes were dashed.\r\n\r\nBut I also said the storm is over, estimates are still rising, and investors should be looking to buy under $800. You got two more chances this week.\r\n\r\nBe sure to watch the 7-minute video to see the key price support level that held after earnings and gave way to a 16% rally on May 15 to $950.\r\n\r\nWith NVIDIA earnings on deck May 22, we can look forward to another set of data points about the AI debate. My bet is that both NVDA and SMCI will be trading above $1,000 very soon as the boom continues and the bulls win.\r\n\r\nDisclosure: I own shares of NVDA and SMCI for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nGameStop delivered weak sales and profits in late March for their Q4 fiscal 2024 (ended January) and shares subsequently declined by over one-third from above $15 to $10.\n\nOf course that's nothing compared to the moon launch the stock saw this week to $60, but we'll cover that mania after we look at the fundamentals.\n\nThe Q4 numbers propelled analysts to further lower growth estimates, with the Zacks Consensus for both top and bottom lines turning negative on an annual basis for fiscal 2025 (began February).\n\nAt last read, revenues are expected to drop 12.75% to $4.6 billion, while EPS is projected to fall 83% to just a penny.\n\nFor a review of the deteriorating business dynamics for GameStop, see this article from March 27...\n\nGameStop Q4 Earnings Miss Estimates, Sales Decline Y/Y\n\nMeme Stock Cage Match\n\nThe great thing about free markets like we've built and maintained in the United States is that just about anyone can raise money to start a company and just about anyone can invest their hard-earned dollars in those companies.\n\nThe downside is that hype, hucksters, and hysteria are everywhere and never sleep. And our regulatory bodies like the SEC can no more protect us than they can catch all the crooks.\n\nThis past week has been a classic drama of a stock getting renewed hype from believers, fraudsters, and short-squeeze armies. While it may be entertaining to watch as short-sellers cover for big losses and \"apes\" (or kitties) have their day on the field of victory, in the end, very few are getting rich on the mania.\n\nI tried to explain how this all works three years ago with another infamous meme stock, AMC Entertainment, in this article and video from 2021 when the Ape Army was trying to teach the \"evil\" hedge funds a lesson...\n\nAMC FUD Runneth Over: Panic at the Casino!\n\nYears ago on a site called StockTwits, I realized that immature traders often blamed others for \"bashing\" their favorite equities. As if they thought that retail traders saying something good or bad about a stock could impact the flow of money toward or away from it -- in a gigantic forest of institutional capital that dwarfed them.\n\nOne day I described the scene thus...\n\n\"StockTwits is a crazy lil kindergarten where all the kids believe their voices move the trees.\"\n\nThe real lessons about how capital markets work are still valuable. Hopefully, some folks who either bought GME shares above $40 this week (or even thought about it), were reminded that if you bring your dollars to a silly kitten fight on Wall Street, you better not be after justice (or profits) without super-strict risk control.\n\nAdditional content:\n\n3 Sector ETFs to Play on Renewed Fed Rate Cut Hopes\n\nIn April, inflationary pressures showed signs of easing, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on a \"core\" basis rising 3.6% year over year, in line with expectations. This marked a cooling from the 3.8% increase observed in March. Monthly core price increases also aligned with expectations at 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the previous three months.\n\nDespite the moderation in inflation, analysts suggest that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to rush into cutting interest rates. Bank of America Securities economist Stephen Juneau stated that while the April data is a positive step, it may not be sufficient to prompt significant action from the Fed just yet, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need for sustained data before making any decisions regarding interest rates.\n\nBut then, retail sales in April remained unchanged, contrasting with a 0.6% increase in March and defying the 0.4% rise anticipated by economists, as reported by Bloomberg, quoted on Yahoo Finance. This unexpected stagnation in consumer spending indicates a possible shift in consumer behavior amidst persistent inflation and higher interest rates. This somber economic data might force the Fed to reconsider its tough stance on monetary policy in the near term.\n\nReturn of Fed Rate Cut Bets\n\nWe would like to note that following the CPI release, market expectations regarding rate cuts shifted slightly, with a modest increase in the probability of a rate cut in September according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Following the release of data, there was a 52.7% chance of a 25-bps worth of September rate cut, down from 50.5% chance recorded a day earlier.\n\nHowever, Powell suggested that the process of bringing inflation back down to the 2% target might take longer and could potentially be more challenging than anticipated. The U.S. benchmark treasury yield was 4.36% on May 15, 2024, down from 4.45% recorded a day earlier.\n\nSector ETFs to Win\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few sectors and its ETFs that could perform better in the near term.\n\nTechnology \u2013 Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\n\nTech companies, particularly those in growth phases, often rely on external financing to fund research and development, expand operations, and acquire other businesses. With chances of lower borrowing costs taking shape following softer inflation print, these companies can fund innovations with cheaper capital.\n\nTechnology stocks are often valued based on future earnings potential rather than current profitability. When interest rates are low, the discounted cash flow used to value these companies yield higher present values for future earnings. In a nutshell, the lower the rate, the higher the value of tech companies\u2019 future cash flows. The fund added 2.3% on May 15.\n\nUtilities \u2013 Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund\n\nThe utilities sector is a rate sensitive sector as it requires huge infrastructure which places a massive debt burden and the resultant interest obligation on its operators. This leaves the sector with no scope of outperformance in a rising rate environment. As a result, a weak inflation print is good news for the utilities space. In any case, utilities stocks have been in great shape currently due to better demand-supply fundamentals. The fund, which added 1.5% on May 15, yields 3.04% annually.\n\nReal Estate \u2013 Schwab U.S. REIT ETF\n\nThis is yet another sector that performs well in a low-rate environment. These stocks often rely on borrowing to finance property acquisitions and developments. Low interest rates reduce the cost of this debt, which can enhance profitability and cash flow.\n\nMoreover, since REITs pay higher dividends, lower interest rates can lead to better cash flows and potentially higher and more stable dividend payouts. This is an attractive phenomenon to income-focused investors. The fund, which gained 1.4% on May 15, yields 3.33% annually.\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.\n\nGet it free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) reported their March quarterly earnings on April 30 and inspired analysts to once again boost growth estimates for the provider of key datacenter infrastructure in the early innings of the AI boom.\r\n\r\nAfter SMCI delivered strong numbers and guidance, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year (ends June) rose 6% from $22.15 to $23.51, representing 99% annual growth.\r\n\r\nAnd next fiscal year jumped over 17% from $28.95 to $34, which would equate to a 44.6% advance.\r\n\r\nThese rising profits are being drawn from equally impressive growth on the topline, with the current year approaching a 110% leap to nearly $15 billion and next year's projections are stalking $24 billion for another 60% surge.\r\n\r\nI Remember Ye Yay High\r\n\r\nAs a devoted NVIDIA (NVDA) investor, I like to remind others that \"as goes GPU demand, so goes datacenter build-out.\" And just as investors continue to doubt NVIDIA's growth as having any sustainability, so too they miss its little satellites profiting from the boom.\r\n\r\nIt seems it was only a few months ago when SMCI was a $300 stock.

        "title": "Where Will Super Micro Computer Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "If you invested $1,000 on Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) five years ago, you would have $37,000 today -- an eyewatering return of 3,700%. Companies like this demonstrate the potentially life-changing impacts of long-term investing.\n\nBut past performance doesn't necessarily guarantee future results. Let's dig deeper to find out if Super Micro can continue to deliver market-beating growth over the next half-decade.\n\nWhy Super Micro Computer?\n\nFounded in 1993, Silicon Valley-based Super Micro Computer is a technology company specializing in energy-efficient computer servers and data-center equipment. It isn't the flashiest company. But as a picks-and-shovels provider for other enterprises, it has enjoyed significant spillover benefits from technology megatrends like cloud computing and 5G connectivity, which increase demand for its hardware.\n\nThe launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 and the subsequent generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom were Super Micro's big break. Part of Super Micro's business involves turning Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) into ready-to-use computer servers for clients, so the rising demand for Nvidia hardware also boosted its business. These positive trends have continued in the third quarter.\n\nSuper Micro's revenue jumped around 200% year over year to $3.85 billion, while net income skyrocketed from $86 million to $402 million, based largely on AI-related demand.\n\nAnalysts are confident that the AI industry momentum will continue in the near term, with Barclays expecting national AI projects in East Asia and the Middle East to provide additional demand for data-center hardware. Super Micro is also diversifying its supply chain by building servers using GPUs developed by Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices, thereby reducing its overreliance on one chipmaker.\n\nThe company is not without challenges\n\nSuper Micro's future looks bright from an operational standpoint. But the company isn't without risks. Enterprise clients have already poured billions into generative AI hardware, and it is unclear how much more they can afford to spend before shareholders push back.\n\nAccording to TheWashington Post, AI chatbots like ChatGPT lose money on every query because of their extremely high running and training costs. And the growing popularity of free, open-source large language models (LLMs) like Elon Musk's Grok or Meta's LLaMA could undermine the industry's profit potential by introducing more competition. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, most of the money in AI is being made by selling enabling hardware rather than by developing consumer-facing software. This is a classic California Gold Rush scenario where the sellers of picks and shovels outperformed the actual gold miners. But if the gold miners pack up and go home, the equipment providers will lose their customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro faces an additional threat from competition in the server market. While the company benefits from rising demand for AI chips, it doesn't design or manufacture the chips itself. This means its economic moat is somewhat weak. And it will face competition from other server makers like Dell Technologies or Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which are also using Nvidia chips to develop servers for AI-related workloads.\n\nIs Super Micro stock a buy?\n\nWhile it is uncomfortable to buy a stock that has already risen so far so fast, Super Micro still looks like a decent investment. Granted, the company faces a somewhat shallow economic moat and the undeniable risk of the AI industry not meeting expectations. But with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 22, the market seems to have already priced-in most of the potential downside.\n\nWhile Super Micro stock probably won't rise by another 3,900% over the next five years, a healthy operational-growth rate coupled with a reasonable valuation makes it look likely to outperform the market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Wall Street Jumps To All-Time Highs On Soft Inflation, Bond Yields Tumble, Bitcoin Soars, Meme Stocks Face Carnage: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices rose to fresh record highs during morning trading on Wednesday following a broadly in-line inflation report and cooler-than-expected retail sales data for April, as traders increased their rate cut bets.\n\nInflation calculated on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket came in at 3.4% year-on-year in April 2024, matching estimates and snapping a streak of three consecutive months of hotter-than-expected readings.\n\nMarket-implied probabilities on the Federal Reserve enacting a rate cut as early as September 2024 rose to over 70%, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool. Cumulatively, traders are now fully pricing in two rate cuts of 25 basis points by year end.\n\nThe rate-sensitive 2-year Treasury yields tumbled to 4.75%, down by 7 basis points, marking a notable break below its 200-day moving average.\n\nThe U.S. dollar fell across the board vis-\u00e0-vis other major currencies, with the greenback losing as much as 1% against the low-yielding Japanese yen.\n\nAmong sectors, both tech and real estate rallied the most, given their high sensitivity to interest rates. Top industry performers were homebuilders, as tracked by the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (NYSE:ITB), up 3.2%. Chipmakers, as tracked by the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) followed suit, up 2.2%.\n\nSmall caps, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), also rallied, up by 1%.\n\nMeme-tied stocks, such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Inc. (NYSE:GME), plummeted 23% and 31%, respectively. Wednesday\u2019s negative price actions caused the two stocks to retrace more than half of the wild bullish trend that began on Monday.\n\nIn the commodities space, precious metals soared with gold and silver up 1.3% and 3%, respectively. Crude softened 0.3%.\n\nAmong cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) marked a 5.5% gain.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,105.02 1.0% Nasdaq 100 18,496.99 1.0% S&P 500 5,289.66 0.8% Dow Jones 39,746.97 0.5%\n\nUpdated at 12:33 p.m. EDT\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) roared 0.9% to $528.94, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) was 0.6% up to $398.24 and the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was up 1.2% to $451.04, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nSector-wise, the TechnologySelect Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) outperformed, both up by 1.8%. The EnergySelect Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) was the only one trading in the red, down 0.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday\u2019s Stock Movers\n\nBitcoin-linked Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) rallied over 10%, after boasting a 5% surge on Tuesday. Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:HTZ) tanked nearly 10% after reports that the car-hire company could face liquidity challenges as early as next year. Major EV players sold off substantially amid rumors China is contemplating a reaction to a U.S. tariffs increase. Both Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) and NIO Group Inc. (NYSE:NIO) tumbled 9%, Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) plummeted 8%, XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) fell 4%, and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) dropped by 1.3%. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) inched 0.5% higher, after Morgan Stanley updated its rating assessment to Overweight. Petco Health & Fitness Company Inc.

        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite witnessed a robust 2023 and first quarter of 2024. The bull run has also continued into the second quarter despite growing concerns over inflation.\n\nOn May 14, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended 0.8% higher to close at a new record high of 16,511.18 points. The index has rallied 10% year to date after jumping 43.4% in 2023 to record its best year since 2020.\n\nThis year, so far, has been great for Wall Street, with the Dow and the S&P 500 also notching record highs in February. The Nasdaq was a shade slow in catching up but finally hit an all-time high in February.\n\nThe index has since had a solid run and May particularly has been great. The rally comes despite growing concerns over inflation and rising uncertainty over rate cuts.\n\nFactors Driving the Nasdaq Rally\n\nThis year, the Nasdaq\u2019s dream run has primarily been driven by the enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI.\n\nWhile the opinions of experts on the prospects of generative AI vary, significant enthusiasm surrounding the field has been noticed over the past year. Many believe that AI is still at a nascent stage and its full potential is yet to be realized.\n\nOnce this potential is unlocked, AI is expected to create significant business opportunities for technology companies to produce premium products and, in turn, boost their stocks.\n\nBesides, the development of smart devices is contributing to the growth of the AI space, as they require computing and learning capabilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition, and video analytics.\n\nThese functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, all of which create favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry\u2019s growth.\n\nMoreover, while uncertainty over rate cuts raised concerns, the Federal Reserve said earlier this month that any further interest rate hike is unlikely. High-interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s comments were cheered by investors.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in Nasdaq stocks such as Netflix, Inc. NFLX, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI thathave a strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 52.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 7.4% over the past 60 days. NFLX currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nAlphabet Inc. is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, GOOGL has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare and others.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 30.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.8% over the past 60 days. GOOGL presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 85% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the last 60 days.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 3 Things Smart Investors Should Know About Super Micro Computer Stock",
        "content": "One of the most important components of the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative is semiconductors. High-performance chips, known as graphics processing units (GPUs), are used for all sorts of generative AI applications.\n\nAmong the big names in the chip space is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Shares are up over 2,000% in the last three years. Considering the secular themes fueling AI and the chip market, in particular, Supermicro might look like one of the most compelling investment opportunities out there.\n\nLet's break down a few important items to explore when it comes to investing in Supermicro.\n\n1. Is Supermicro the next Nvidia?\n\nWhen it comes to GPUs, Nvidia is undoubtedly the biggest force in the market right now. However, there are some important distinctions to make between the two companies.\n\nNvidia designs GPUs and sells them to a wide range of customers for applications in autonomous driving, advertising and e-commerce, machine learning, and more. Given Nvidia's dominant position among AI chip developers, the company has achieved a high degree of pricing power. This has led to a lucrative combination of soaring revenue and profits.\n\nOn the other hand, Supermicro is an IT architecture solution for integrated systems. In other words, it designs the storage clusters and server racks where Nvidia's chips sit.\n\nAlthough Supermicro has a strong relationship with Nvidia -- which has ignited an impressive wave of revenue and earnings growth -- the company faces stiff competition from the likes of Dell Technologies, International Business Machines, Hewlett Packard Enterprises, and Lenovo. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. The business isn't the rocket ship that it looks like\n\nThe table below illustrates consensus estimates for Supermicro's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) over the next couple of years. Looking at the financial metrics below, it's hard to sour on the company. These growth projections are impressive and very well could continue even further as AI becomes ever more prolific. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nHowever, I see some risks when it comes to Supermicro. Candidly, while the company provides an important service in the AI realm, storage solutions are relatively commoditized.\n\nAt the end of the day, IT architecture is a low-margin hardware business. This can be seen in the chart below, as rising investments in capital expenditures (capex) are weighing on Supermicro's operating margins. If these trends continue, Supermicro's free cash flow and overall liquidity profile could be at risk in the long run. SMCI Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\n3. Supermicro has a premium valuation\n\nThe chart below benchmarks Supermicro against some of its peers on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis. There's an argument to be made that the company's premium valuation is warranted because Supermicro's revenue is growing in excess of 100% annually on a consistent basis. The company is also continuing to raise forward guidance.\n\nStory continues SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nHowever, the disparity between Supermicro and its peers is too tough to gloss over. Dell and IBM, in particular, are diversified businesses, with integrated systems representing just one of many services. While neither company is growing anywhere near commensurate levels to Supermicro, the magnitude of the discount in valuation multiples is questionable.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia is going to face a rising number of competitors sooner rather than later. Direct competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Intel is already here. Furthermore, big-tech conglomerates, such as Meta Platforms and Amazon, are also building their own chips in-house.\n\nAt this point, it's too difficult to know with any certainty if increasing optionality in the GPU space will help or hurt Supermicro. But considering the existing competition and the rising number of new proprietary chips entering the market, I suspect that, even if Supermicro forges relationships with these additional players, it'll come at a steep cost.\n\nMore specifically, Supermicro will likely need to continue investing heavily in research and development to build special clusters for each new potential customer. Additionally, the company will almost certainly be competing with other IT architecture-solutions providers as it pertains to price. In either scenario, I'm hard-pressed to see how Supermicro will expand margin and cash flow.\n\nI think the chip space, in general, is a generational opportunity. However, tangential businesses such as Supermicro's may be best monitored for now. Investors looking for more steady, reliable growth might consider different aspects of the chip space or AI opportunities, in general.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

Adjusted net income came in at \u00a5175.1 billion compared with \u00a5141 billion in the prior-year quarter.\n\nQuarterly total revenues increased 14% year over year to \u00a53,481 billion. The uptick was driven by an increase in revenues in the Game & Network Services (G&NS), Music, Pictures and Imaging & Sensing Solutions (I&SS) segments\u2019 sales.\n\nSony Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Sony Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nSony Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Sony Corporation Quote\n\nSegmental Results\n\nIn the quarter under review, G&NS sales were up 2.2% year over year to \u00a51097.3 billion. Segmental sales increased on the back of positive impacts of the forex movement and higher sales of non-first-party titles. Operating income rose to \u00a5106 billion from \u00a538.9 billion in the prior-year quarter.\n\nMusic sales improved 23% year over year to \u00a5429.9 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter on the back of higher revenues from streaming services, primarily from paid subscriptions, in recorded music and music publishing. Operating income was \u00a571.2 billion, up from \u00a560.4 billion in the prior-year quarter.\n\nPictures sales increased 13.3% year over year to \u00a5406.7 billion, mainly due to an increase in theatrical releases and higher revenues for Crunchyroll. Operating income was \u00a530.7 billion compared with \u00a515.5 billion a year ago.\n\nET&S sales totaled \u00a5532.7 billion, up 7.8% year over year.

Operating loss was \u00a56.4 billion compared with \u00a533 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nI&SS sales rose 14.3% year over year to \u00a5398.5 billion, owing to an increase in sales of image sensors for mobile products. Operating income was \u00a534.7 billion compared with \u00a531.7 billion in the year-ago quarter owing to favorable forex impact.\n\nFinancial Services sales were \u00a5672.9 billion compared with \u00a5470.6 billion a year ago. The uptick was caused by a significant revenue increase at Sony Life. Also, there is an improvement in net gains and losses on investments related to market fluctuations for separate accounts. Operating income came in at \u00a526.1 billion compared with \u00a551.9 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAll Other sales were down 3.1% to \u00a521.8 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter.

It expects sales of \u00a512,310 billion, down 5% year over year. The top-line performance is likely to be driven by strengthening momentum in the I&SS and Music segments\u2019 sales.\n\nNet income is estimated to be \u00a5925 billion. The metric is expected to decrease year over year, mainly due to an expected increase in income taxes resulting from a decrease in tax credits in Japan and the United States. Operating income is expected to be \u00a51,1275 billion.\n\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\n\nSony currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the broader technology space are Woodward WWD, Arista Networks ANET and Super Micro Computer SMCI.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "May is here, so we are quickly approaching the year's halfway point. Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be a hot theme, though some stocks have cooled as volatility sets in. A famous Wall Street saying is \"Sell in May and go away.\"\n\nBut I'm not having that. In fact, some attractive AI stocks are ripe for the picking -- you just need to know where to look.\n\nHere are three top AI stocks investors should consider scooping up this month.\n\n1. Salesforce\n\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words. Here is a beautiful chart to talk about enterprise software company Salesforce(NYSE: CRM): CRM Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nThe software provider has significantly improved its operating margins and free-cash-flow generation over the past couple of years, giving the stock a head of steam heading into first-quarter earnings in the coming weeks.\n\nMost know Salesforce for its flagship customer relationship management (CRM) services, but the company has also built an ecosystem through innovation and acquisitions, becoming a one-stop shop that companies can use to track customers and sales, operations, and marketing, and stoke employee collaboration.\n\nThe company unveiled Einstein AI, a generative AI assistant to help users get the most out of its product ecosystem.\n\nSalesforce trades at a lofty but well-deserved forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28. That's a steep price tag but one that's justified by the company's improving cash flow and margins.\n\nAnalysts have the company growing earnings by an annual average of more than 17% over the next several years, which makes 28 times forward earnings a fair price for this proven winner.\n\nManagement has begun repurchasing its stock to lower the share count and help boost earnings growth. I expect this to continue as cash flow grows, giving the stock a high floor that investors can depend on at a reasonable price today.\n\n2. UiPath\n\nMost hear \"AI is replacing humans\" and think of robots from the movies. The reality could be more software-based. That's UiPath's (NYSE: PATH) specialty as an expert in robotic process automation (RPA), which involves software learning and performing repetitive computer tasks instead of humans.\n\nThe financial benefits of RPA are obvious for corporations: Software bots don't need breaks or benefits, and they are less prone to mistakes.\n\nNearly 11,000 customers are using UiPath today. They often started out with a small trial run, which then blossomed into full-scale implementation as the software proved useful. That's the secret behind the company's robust 119% dollar-based net revenue retention rate.\n\nStory continues PATH Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nYou can see that the business has grown large enough that cash flow is surging, and bottom-line profits are starting to follow suit. Analysts are pegging UiPath for annual earnings growth averaging 22% over the next three to five years. Shares trade at a forward P/E ratio of 34 today, making UiPath a potential bargain for long-term investors.\n\n3. Super Micro Computer\n\nOver the past year, this stock has become a sensation, flying higher as people picked Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) to provide their turnkey server systems for AI applications. The ride has been volatile at times. While shares change hands at $800 today, the stock has traded as high as $1,200 and as low as $130 over the past year. So, what should we make of this vast range? Pay attention to the fundamentals.\n\nFortunately for bullish investors, Super Micro Computer is growing like a weed. Revenue increases have accelerated to triple-digit rates in the AI age. Management attributes this to AI tailwinds and the fact that customers are overwhelmingly choosing Super Micro Computer over competitors, leading to above-industry growth. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nThe numbers say shares are a table-pounding buy right now. Analysts are looking for earnings growth averaging 52% annually for the next several years, while the stock's forward P/E is \"just\" 35 today. If those growth numbers prove accurate, the stock will be a mind-numbing bargain in hindsight.\n\nRemember that volatility is rampant with this stock, which fell nearly 20% recently because the company chose not to pre-announce earnings. Investors who are bullish on Super Micro Computer might want to approach cautiously and buy the stock slowly so they don't get caught up in the noise. Otherwise, this stock looks ripe for value-focused growth investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Salesforce wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in Super Micro (SMCI) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Super Micro Computer (SMCI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nSuper Micro currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.92, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.92 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for SMCI Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for SMCI\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Super Micro here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Super Micro, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs SMCI Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Super Micro, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.3% over the past month to $23.51.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Super Micro.

        "title": "Utility stocks are on fire \u2014 here are Wall Street analysts' top picks",
        "content": "Utility stocks have turned into leaders recently, gaining more than 4% over the past five days to close out their best week of the year.\n\nThe S&P 500 Utilities ETF (XLU) is up more than 12% year to date in a reversal from last year when investors soured on the sector due to expensive projects and high interest rates.\n\nThe prospects of lower rates later this year and increased long-term demand for electricity from artificial intelligence has made the defensive part of the market look attractive, according to Wall Street analysts.\n\n\"The excitement surrounding AI has left many investors searching for the next big thing after meteoric rallies in names like Nvidia (NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI),\" said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, in a recent note.\n\nEnergy consumption is expected to dramatically increase amid a boom in data center growth.\n\nAdditionally, a re-shoring of manufacturing, which requires more power for battery plants and chipmaking factories, and the proliferation of charging stations for electric vehicles are expected to drive a surge in energy demand.\n\n\"Power demand [in the US] for the first time in 15 years is actually growing,\" Neil Kalton, senior equity analyst at Wells Fargo, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nConstellation Energy (CEG)\n\nConstellation Energy is the largest owner of nuclear plantsin the US. The Baltimore-based company has been a beneficiary of the government's push to transition to green energies and growing power demand from data centers.\n\nConstellation shares are up more than 85% year to date as the company forecasts base earnings to grow by at least 10% annually through the decade.\n\n\"It is absolutely a growth stock and has attracted growth investors,\" said Well Fargo's Kalton.\n\nThe analyst highlights that Constellation produces power at roughly $25 per megawatt hour, while the government's Inflation Reduction Act allows for a selling price floor of $45 per megawatt hour, providing a minimum of $20 margin per megawatt hour.\n\n\"There is no limit to the profits they can make,\" said Kalton.\n\nWall Street is also bullish on the possibility of Big Tech building large-scale data centers with Constellation at their nuclear sites.\n\n\"The appeal of non-regulated nuclear, which is what Constellation owns, is that you could build a data center on the land at site and just directly hook into the data power plant there and take power,\" said Kalton.\n\nDuring the company's earnings call CEO Joseph Dominguez highlighted the massive amount of energy hyperscalers will require.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We're going to need data centers that are of size and dimension from a megawatt standpoint that is far beyond what currently exists out there in the market,\" said Dominguez.\n\n\"The data economy and Constellation's nuclear energy go together like peanut butter and jelly. And as such, we're in advanced conversations with multiple clients, large, well-known companies that you all know, about powering their needs,\" he added.\n\nConstellation has been operating as a standalone energy provider since 2022 after a spin-off from utility giant Exelon (EXC). The company has been buying back shares and recently upped its dividend ahead of its earnings due on Thursday.\n\nThe stock has eight Buy, five Hold, and zero Sell analyst recommendations. Constellation Energy operates the nation's largest fleet of nuclear power plants, including Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant on the Chesapeake Bay in Lusby, Maryland. (Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) (Baltimore Sun via Getty Images)\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\n\nThe $147-billion-market-cap company is one of the largest electric power generators in the country. While NextEra owns a regulated utility in Florida, investors are more interested in its non-regulated part of the business, NextEra Energy Resources, which involves developing renewable energy in the US.\n\n\"The demand for renewables over the next five to 10 years is set to explode,\" said Kalton.\n\nNextEra foresees annual earnings growth of 6% to 8% through 2026.\n\nThe company's CEO highlighted the boom in data center power needs and the onshoring of manufacturing capabilities to the US as reasons for the surge in demand.\n\n\"The re-domestication of industry in the US supported by public policy will drive the need for more electricity,\" CEO John Ketchum told analysts in April.\n\nThe stock is up about 20% year to date. The stock has 17 Buy, five Hold, and one Sell analyst recommendations.\n\nSouthern Company (SO)\n\nAmong the regulated utilities, Southern Company is one of the best performers inside the Utility sector year to date, with shares up more than 10%.\n\nThe company has benefited from data centers looking to build in the Georgia area, which represents higher electricity usage.\n\nLast year Southern's subsidiary Georgia Power debuted the first nuclear reactor plant built from scratch in decades. Currently four nuclear units are in operation.\n\nThe Atlanta-based energy provider recently posted first quarter earnings per share 14% higher than the same period last year. Sales to data centers were up over 12% for the quarter compared to the same period in 2024.\n\n\"This is what making history looks like. These are the first new nuclear units built from the ground up here in the United States in over 30 years and we are proud to be the company that saw it through,\" Southern's CEO Chris Womack said during the company's latest earnings call.\n\nSouthern shares are up 9% year to date. The stock has 11 Buy, seven Hold, and three Sell analyst recommendations.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter at @ines_ferre.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Nasdaq Stocks That Could Crush Nvidia and Deliver Bigger Gains, Thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI)",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has been in fine form in the past year, clocking impressive gains of 50%, as some of the key components of this index have witnessed a red-hot rally thanks to the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nShares of Nasdaq-100 component Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), for instance, have shot up 221% in the past year. The chipmaker's terrific rally is justified by its outstanding growth. Nvidia's monopoly-like position in the market for AI chips -- where it holds 95%-plus market share according to some estimates -- has supercharged the company's top and bottom lines, which is evident from the chart below. NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nWhat's more, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings to increase at a healthy annual rate of 38% over the next five years. Based on Nvidia's earnings of $12.96 per share in the recently concluded fiscal 2024, its bottom line could jump to almost $65 per share after five years, according to analyst estimates.\n\nEven if Nvidia trades at 30 times earnings after five years, in line with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple, its stock price could jump to $1,950. That would be a 112% jump from current levels.\n\nHowever, Nvidia isn't the only stock that's winning big from the rapid adoption of AI. There are two other Nasdaq stocks that are making the most of the AI opportunity and they could deliver more upside than Nvidia over the next five years.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has outperformed Nvidia in the past year with stunning gains of 505%. Supermicro, which is known for manufacturing AI server solutions, can continue to outperform Nvidia over the next five years, thanks to the fast-growing market it operates in.\n\nSupermicro's servers are deployed by data center operators to mount chips from the likes of Nvidia and other chipmakers, which keeps their operating costs in check. Supermicro's modular server solutions aim to lower electricity and cooling costs in data centers.\n\nFor instance, Supermicro launched liquid-cooled server solutions for deploying Nvidia's massively popular H100 chips in May last year, claiming that they can reduce electricity costs in data centers by 40%. Additionally, Supermicro claims that its liquid-cooled H100 servers could reduce cooling costs by 86% when compared to existing data centers.\n\nConsidering the significant amount of electricity that AI data centers consume, the demand for Supermicro's servers is booming. This explains why the company's revenue and earnings grew remarkably in the previous quarter. Super Micro's fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue (for the three months ended March 31) tripled year over year to $3.85 billion. Its earnings jumped fourfold to $6.65 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro's full-year guidance now calls for revenue to increase 110% year over year to $14.9 billion at the midpoint. Earnings are expected to jump to $23.69 per share from $11.81 per share in the same period last year. Even better, analysts are expecting its earnings to increase at an annual rate of 62% for the next five years.\n\nThat won't be surprising as the market for AI servers is expected to clock annual growth of 30% over the next decade. Supermicro is growing faster than the market it serves, which explains why analysts are expecting its earnings growth to remain robust. Assuming the company's bottom line does grow at 60% a year for the next five years, its earnings could hit $124 per share after five years.\n\nMultiplying the projected earnings with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 points toward a stock price of $3,720 after five years, a 348% jump from current levels. Even if growth rates taper off, Supermicro still has a better growth probability than Nvidia. So, Supermicro looks like a solid alternative to Nvidia for investors looking to buy an AI stock right now, given that it seems capable of outperforming the latter over the next five years.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is another tech giant that's capitalizing on the adoption of AI. The social media bellwether has been integrating AI tools into its different platforms and is also leveraging the technology to help advertisers increase returns on their spending.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg explained Meta's AI initiatives in detail on the company's first-quarter earnings conference call last month. He claimed that the company's generative AI assistant, Meta AI, has been tried by \"tens of millions of people,\" and it will be rolled out in more countries and languages in the future.\n\nMeta AI is being integrated into WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram. From allowing creators to generate high-quality images to enabling businesses to suggest products for customers, Meta Platforms is setting itself up to monetize its AI offerings in the long run. According to Zuckerberg:\n\nOn the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\n\nThe good news for investors is that Meta's AI offerings are giving the company's growth a nice boost. Its revenue increased 27% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 to $36.4 billion. Earnings, meanwhile, shot up an impressive 114% year over year to $4.71 per share. Meta should be able to sustain a healthy earnings growth rate in the long run as it starts monetizing more of its AI offerings.\n\nAnalysts are currently expecting the company's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 28% over the next five years, which would be a nice jump over the 11% annual earnings growth it has clocked in the past five years. Using its 2023 earnings of $14.87 per share as the base, Meta's bottom line could jump to $51 per share in five years based on the potential earnings growth that analysts expect it to deliver.\n\nMultiplying that with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 points toward a stock price of $1,530 after five years, a 229% jump from current levels. Given that the stock is trading at 27 times earnings right now, investors are getting a good deal on this Nasdaq stock that seems capable of outperforming Nvidia in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "\"AI requires exponentially more computing power and capacity than was previously imagined.\"\n\n-- Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman\n\nThere's a gold rush underway in artificial intelligence (AI). The companies that can supply the \"picks and shovels\" will likely deliver wealth-building gains to their investors. This means the state-of-the-art chips and related computing infrastructure that power the most advanced machine learning applications.\n\nHere are two tech leaders who are providing this vital computing capacity. Both of these AI stocks are particularly strong buys today.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nNvidia gets much of the attention among AI chipmakers. That's certainly understandable. The semiconductor behemoth designs the cutting-edge chips that enable popular AI applications, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. But with so many businesses rushing to reap the productivity and efficiency gains AI promises, many more of these chips are needed -- and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) stands ready to supply them.\n\nAMD's revenue rose by 2% year over year to $5.5 billion in the first quarter. But these sales belie the company's promising growth prospects. The chip designer's data center revenue soared by 80% to $2.3 billion as companies scooped up AMD's latest graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) to power their cloud computing operations.\n\nRevenue in the company's client segment increased by an even more impressive 85% to $1.4 billion, fueled by strong sales of its AI-enabled Ryzen 8000 Series processor. These explosive growth metrics were offset by lower video game-related sales, which should rebound when console makers launch new devices in the coming years.\n\nChip buyers are eager to foster competition in the supply-constrained AI semiconductor market. Tech giants like Microsoft and Meta Platforms are jumping at the chance to deploy AMD's new MI300 accelerators, which can speed up machine learning workloads in their data centers. At the same time, computer makers like HP and Dell are featuring AMD's AI-enabled Ryzen processors in their newest line of PCs.\n\nThe opportunity in the data center market alone is enormous. CEO Lisa Su estimates that demand for AI accelerators could surge to $400 billion by 2027. For context, AMD expects to generate data center chip sales of roughly $4 billion in 2024.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nStrong demand for AI chips is also boosting sales of supporting computing hardware -- a boon for Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). The provider of high-performance servers, data storage systems, and other AI-optimized equipment is enjoying spectacular growth. Yet, today, you have a chance to scoop up its stock at a sizable discount to its recent highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro (as the company is commonly called) saw its sales triple to $3.85 billion in the quarter ended March 31. Its net profit surged an even more remarkable 367% to $402 million. Supermicro is winning market share in the fast-growing AI infrastructure market. The server specialist has close ties to Nvidia, so it's benefiting disproportionately from the torrid demand for the chipmaker's AI offerings.\n\nYet, despite these impressive growth metrics, Supermicro's shares have pulled back from the prices they reached earlier this year. The stock is now down about 35% from its all-time highs. Shares are trading for roughly 33 times management's adjusted earnings per share forecast for 2024. That's quite a bargain for an AI hardware leader projected to grow per-share profits by more than 60% annually over the next five years.\n\nInvesting in quality businesses set to cash in on the AI revolution when their shares are temporarily on sale is a smart strategy for wealth accumulation. Today, you have one such opportunity with Super Micro Computer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $543,758!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Should You Buy the Dip on Super Micro Computer Stock?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has been a fantastic stock to own in 2024, as it's up nearly 200% this year. However, that figure was more than 300% at one time; the stock is nowhere near its 2024 highs.\n\nWith the stock about $400 off of its highs, is it time to buy the dip? After all, Super Micro Computer (often called Supermicro) has been growing at a lightning pace.\n\nArtificial intelligence demand is fueling Supermicro's stock\n\nSupermicro is cashing in on the same trend that many others have been: artificial intelligence (AI). In essence, Super Micro Computer gave investors a second chance to buy Nvidia, as it's a very similar style of investment.\n\nSuper Micro Computer makes highly customizable servers, which are essential for maximizing the performance of the hardware within them. For AI, these servers are packed full of GPUs (graphics processing units), often made by AI king Nvidia. Companies wanting to expand their computing power can't just haphazardly hook up their GPUs; they need to put them in a server where they are properly networked and cooled. As the demand for AI computing power accelerates, Supermicro benefits.\n\nSupermicro is also closely tied with Nvidia, which was on display when Super Micro Computer became the first server maker to market Nvidia GH200 and GB200 GPUs, which are next-generation technologies.\n\nThe demand increase that Supermicro is experiencing is very similar to the level Nvidia saw back in 2023. So, when investors recognized this at the start of 2024, they bid up the stock to levels where Supermicro would have been if it had experienced the same growth as Nvidia.\n\nHowever, the market realized that this level was far too high, which is why the stock sold off recently. Its earnings, though, have been nothing short of fantastic.\n\nThe stock is still quite expensive, even if long-term projections are hit\n\nIn the fiscal third-quarter of 2024 that ended March 31, Supermicro's revenue rose an astounding 200% year over year to $3.85 billion. Guidance was also strong, with management expecting between $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion in revenue for fiscal Q4, representing 133% to 152% growth.\n\nBut the problem is that the market was expecting that level of growth, so the stock didn't skyrocket following earnings; it actually fell more than 10%.\n\nThe biggest issue with Super Micro Computer is that its current trading level doesn't align with management's long-term goals, which are to achieve $25 billion in annual revenue. In the fiscal third quarter, Supermicro posted a profit margin of 10%, so if it could maintain that profitability level for an entire year and hit its revenue goal, it would produce $2.5 billion in profits. Supermicro currently sports a $48 billion market cap, so the stock would trade around 19 times earnings if all those projections were true.\n\nStory continues SMCI Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nConsidering that Nvidia trades for around 34 times forward earnings right now, this doesn't leave much room for Supermicro's stock to grow. Furthermore, Supermicro should be valued at a discount to Nvidia as it doesn't have as much differentiating technology or margin levels as Nvidia does.\n\nAs a result, Super Micro Computer is still trading around levels that it would be if it hit management's long-term goals. That doesn't leave much room for upside, which makes me want to avoid the stock.\n\nOne thing to note: This doesn't mean I think Supermicro will struggle as a company. Due to massive AI demand, it should do quite well. However, the juice has already been squeezed from this stock, and AI investors should look for another company to quench their AI thirst.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SMCI) high institutional ownership speaks for itself as stock continues to impress, up 4.9% over last week",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Super Micro Computer's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions The top 12 shareholders own 51% of the company Insiders have been selling lately\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 68% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nLast week\u2019s 4.9% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 486% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Super Micro Computer.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Super Micro Computer?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that Super Micro Computer does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Super Micro Computer, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Super Micro Computer is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 11% and 9.1% of the stock. Charles Liang, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chairman of the Board.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nStory continues\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Super Micro Computer\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Super Micro Computer, Inc.. Insiders own US$6.9b worth of shares in the US$48b company. That's quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Super Micro Computer has  4 warning signs  (and 2 which are a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.\n\nUltimately the future is most important. You can access this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have been big winners on the stock market in the past year, delivering stunning gains as their revenue and earnings growth soared thanks to growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware.\n\nWhile Nvidia stock has more than tripled in the past year, Super Micro's gains have been even more phenomenal at 474%. It wouldn't be surprising to see them sustain their red-hot momentum in the future as well. But if you have to choose one of these two AI stocks right now for your portfolio, which one should you be buying? Let's find out.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia is playing a crucial role in boosting the adoption of AI through its graphics cards. The massive parallel computing power of the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) allows customers to train AI models, formally known as large language models (LLMs), and also deploy those models to solve problems in the real world.\n\nCustomers across the globe have flocked to Nvidia's hardware to shore up their AI capabilities, giving the chipmaker a 90%-plus share of the fast-growing AI chip market. And Nvidia's dominance seems here to stay, as its competitors are way behind. Advanced Micro Devices, for instance, pointed out on its most recent earnings conference call that its revenue from sales of AI graphics cards would land at $4 billion in 2024.\n\nIntel, on the other hand, is forecasting $500 million in revenue from selling AI accelerators in the second half of 2024. Nvidia, for comparison, finished its most recent fiscal year 2024 (which ended in January this year) with data center revenue of $47.5 billion, which was more than triple the revenue in the preceding year.\n\nIn short, Nvidia is simply running away with the market for data center chips, a trend that's expected to continue thanks to the company's solid product roadmap. The chipmaker recently revealed its next-generation Blackwell B200 GPU, which is expected to be four times faster in AI training and a whopping 30 times faster in AI inference when compared to the current flagship, the H100.\n\nNvidia's H100 has been a runaway success, and it wouldn't be surprising to see the next-generation offering help the company maintain its dominant position in this space. The company's revenue from sales of AI chips is expected to multiply at an eye-popping pace in the coming years.\n\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia's revenue forecasts for the next three fiscal years have received a big bump of late. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe company finished fiscal 2024 with record revenue of $60.9 billion, and the chart above indicates that its top line could multiply nearly 2.7x in just three years. Nvidia has a five-year average sales multiple of 18.7. A similar multiple in three years would send its market cap to just over $3 trillion, a jump of 35% from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is trading at a rich 36 times sales now. So even a substantially discounted valuation after the next three years could lead to a potentially impressive upside. However, don't be surprised to see Nvidia commanding a premium valuation at that time thanks to its commanding position in the AI chip market, which is expected to clock annual growth of more than 36% through the end of the decade.\n\nThe case for Super Micro Computer\n\nJust like Nvidia, Super Micro Computer is also a play on the AI chip market. However, instead of designing chips, Super Micro manufactures AI server products on which the graphics cards from the likes of Nvidia are mounted.\n\nJust like Nvidia, Super Micro is a key player in the market for AI servers. The company gets more than half of its revenue from selling AI servers. Super Micro has generated $11.8 billion in revenue in the past year. Assuming half of that has come from selling AI server products, Super Micro's revenue from the AI server market should ideally stand at $6 billion.\n\nThe AI server market was worth an estimated $12 billion last year, indicating that Super Micro may be controlling half of this market. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting the global AI server market to hit $50 billion in annual revenue in 2029, clocking a compound annual growth rate of 26%. Super Micro, however, is growing at a much faster pace than the AI server market.\n\nThis is evident from the company's latest results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended March 31). Super Micro's revenue tripled on a year-over-year basis during the quarter to $3.85 billion. The company also raised its full-year outlook and now expects to finish fiscal 2024 with revenue of $14.9 billion, which would be a 110% increase over the previous year.\n\nSo Super Micro seems set to gain a bigger share of the AI server market. This explains why analysts have substantially raised their growth expectations for Super Micro, as evident from the following chart. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe chart above indicates that Super Micro is on its way to almost doubling its revenue in the next two years. Assuming the company does hit $27 billion in revenue after a couple of years and maintains its current price-to-sales ratio of 3.8 at that time, its market cap could jump to $103 billion. That would be a 124% increase from current levels.\n\nMore importantly, Super Micro's sales multiple is much lower than Nvidia's, and Super Micro stock is also trading at a discount to the U.S. technology sector's average sales multiple of 6.8. So if the market decides to reward Super Micro with a higher multiple, it could deliver much stronger gains.\n\nThe verdict\n\nThe signs are that Super Micro Computer stock could deliver more upside than Nvidia. Moreover, Super Micro is way cheaper than Nvidia, as the sales multiples of the two companies indicate. What's more, analysts are expecting Super Micro's earnings to increase at a much faster pace than Nvidia's.\n\nThe AI server manufacturer's bottom line is forecast to increase at an annual rate of 62% over the next five years, outpacing the 35% annual growth that Nvidia is expected to deliver over the same period. So investors looking to buy one of these two AI stocks could consider buying Super Micro given its attractive valuation and the outstanding growth that it has been posting.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 10, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Meta Platforms META, Super Micro Computer SMCI, Robinhood Markets HOOD, Arm Holdings ARM and Coinbase Global COIN.\n\nEPS Season: 3 Standout Reports\n\nUnlike last quarter, this earnings season is proving more treacherous for investors. Slight misses or even a lack of better-than-expected forward guidance is being punished in stocks like Meta Platforms. Meanwhile, bears pounced on AI juggernaut Super Micro Computer for simply not pre-announcing earnings like it did last quarter.\n\nOverall, Wall Street is providing clues that a lot of the recent good news has been priced into stocks. Furthermore, even the strongest bull markets experience ebbs and flows and do not trend higher in a straight line. Nonetheless, earnings and underlying fundamentals drive stocks in the long term, and bull markets tend to last much longer than most anticipate.\n\nBelow are the three of the strongest earnings reports of this earnings season thus far:\n\nRobinhood Markets\n\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Robinhood is one of the most popular brokerages in the United States. Robinhood was the first major broker to \u201cdemocratize\u201d trading by offering a commission-free investing app. The app rose to prominence during the meme stock craze that was spurred on by retail investing groups on the social media platforms.\n\nConsistent Positive EPS Surprises\n\nLast night, HOOD reported first-quarter earnings that trounced Zacks Consensus Estimates by 260%. Over the past four quarters, positive earnings beats have become the norm, with an average EPS beat of 230%!\n\nRecord Net Deposits\n\nNet deposits are one of the most important metrics to monitor for brokers. HOOD net deposits reached a record $11.2 billion in Q1, translating to a 44% annualized growth rate and contributing to a 30% growth rate over the last twelve months.\n\nRobinhood Gold Is Growing\n\nRobinhood recently announced a new \u201cGold\u201d credit card. HOOD has already gained a healthy 260,000 new subscribers.\n\nArm Holdings\n\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock ARM Holdings is a dominant player in the semiconductor industry due to the company\u2019s energy-efficient designs, which are critical to the function of smartphones, laptops, and AI servers. Though ARM shares have come down to Earth after an explosive debut, the company\u2019s fundamentals are very much intact.\n\nStrong Revenue Growth Expected\n\nRevenue is expected to remain solid and steady, growing 23.19% in 2025 and expected to grow more than 20% in 2026.\n\nBullish CEO Comments\n\nOne statement from the ARM CEO in the conference call stood out to me: \u201cFrom cloud to edge, all AI software models, from GPT to Llama, rely and run on the Arm compute platform. As these models become larger and smarter, their requirements for more compute with greater power and efficiency can only be realized through Arm.\u201d My interpretation of this statement is that Arm is one of the best AI \u201cpure plays\u201d on Wall Street.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase Global\n\nCoinbase is the leading crypto exchange in the United States. Recently, COIN smashed earnings estimates by reporting EPS of $1.64 billion versus estimates of $1.32 billion. However, what\u2019s most impressive about COIN is that despite volatility in the crypto industry, the company\u2019s cash hoard has grown steadily since going public back in 2021.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThough earnings reactions were relatively muted this quarter, these three companies are firing on all cylinders.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "The technology sector is known for its rapid growth and disruptive innovation. This can create opportunities for investors to capitalize on 5X potential tech stocks.\n\nIf you\u2019re searching for tech stocks with the potential to multiply your investments, you\u2019ve come to the right place. These companies are often in emerging sectors like 5G, artificial intelligence, renewable energy, cybersecurity and infrastructure. While there are no guarantees in the stock market, these unique tech companies possess all the necessary ingredients for explosive growth through 2030.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack the top 5X potential tech stocks investors should snap up in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) is undoubtedly in the discussion for the top 5X potential tech stocks to buy. The company has changed the game for music streaming, holding a \u2153 of the music streaming market share.\n\nSpotify presents a compelling investment opportunity as its service reaches critical mass and profitability continues to drive growth. As the world\u2019s largest music streaming platform, Spotify boasts over 600 million MAUs. Their user base is growing exponentially and will reach over 1 billion in the coming years. But investors are excited about the company\u2019s shift into the podcasting arena. They have invested heavily in acquiring exclusive rights to popular podcasts, positioning themselves to dominate the market.\n\nIn their latest quarterly results, Spotify\u2019s revenue increased 20% YOY to $3.6 billion. Operating margin expansion continued in the quarter, with operating income hitting a record $168 million. Moreover, MAUs and premium subscribers saw YOY growth in the mid to high teens.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a leading player in the server and storage hardware markets. The company is well-positioned for continued growth with the increasing demand for cloud computing, data centers, and AI.\n\nThe company is strategically focused on designing and manufacturing high-performance, customizable server solutions that give it an edge over its competitors. Their next-generation liquid cooling components are essential for deployment and rapid acceleration of AI workloads. It is coupled with unparalleled performance, which is evident by the rapid demand for their products from hyperscalers.\n\nSuper Micro may surprisingly have a multi-decade tailwind for growth, and their recent S&P 500 inclusion is just the beginning. In Q3 FY24, revenue skyrocketed 200% YOY to $3.85 billion. EPS more than tripled to $6.56 per share, driven by strong demand for AI rack scale PnP solutions. With demand for AI solutions accelerating rapidly, SMCI stock remains at the forefront of the technological renaissance. This makes Super Micro one of the best 5X potential tech stocks to buy now.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a semiconductor giant quietly leading the AI revolution.

Their Snapdragon X platforms are crucial to modern mobile connectivity, providing customized chips for smartphones, tablets and PCs. The company\u2019s reveal of the Snapdragon X Elite CPU has garnered a lot of attention due to its ability to run AI models 2X faster than its competitors.\n\nHowever, it is not just about their prospects in the PC market but their full-stack AI solutions for the smartphone, automotive, IoT, and cloud markets. They remained well positioned to capitalize on the growth of AI and how it converges with multiple areas of their business.

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Every big investing theme has winners that rise to the top. Amazon was the champion of e-commerce, and Microsoft was the king of computers. Which companies will dominate artificial intelligence (AI)? It could be too early to tell for sure, but some potential favorites are emerging from the pack.\n\nSnowflake(NYSE: SNOW) and SuperMicroComputer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have become pivotal in the development and growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. These stocks have the ingredients to generate lucrative investment returns over the long term and both trade at attractive prices today.\n\nHere is the pitch for why these two AI stocks could help you become a millionaire investor.\n\n1. Snowflake is at the center of artificial intelligence\n\nData is at the heart of AI. Wall Street has been in a frenzy over Nvidia and the AI chip landscape, but AI is only as good as the data the model is trained on. That's where Snowflake could have a critical role over the coming years. Snowflake is a cloud-based platform where data can be stored, analyzed, and queried. Customers can also access third-party data on Snowflake's marketplace, letting companies efficiently manipulate and enhance their data as needed.\n\nSnowflake grows through two primary engines. First, it works with more customers. The company currently has over 9,400 customers and ended its fiscal year 2024 with a 22% year-over-year increase in customer count. Second, Snowflake bills customers based on computing and storage usage. Since data grows exponentially, most customers will likely use more computing and storage over time. That's a big reason why Snowflake boasts an impressive 131% net revenue retention rate.\n\nAssuming AI is as important as it seems, every company could eventually need AI to compete. There are hundreds of thousands of corporations worldwide, meaning Snowflake is very early in its customer expansion story. Snowflake could conceivably grow revenue at a double-digit rate for years to come. The business also generates robust cash flow; approximately 42% of revenue is now winding up as free cash flow.\n\nSnowflake went public in late 2020, and shares have continually compressed since the market bubble popped months later. Today, Snowflake's valuation is a fraction of what it once was and is currently at its lowest point as a public company: SNOW EV to Revenues (Forward) Chart\n\nI won't try to call a bottom on the stock, but it's clear that much of its hot air is gone now. Long-term investors who believe in Snowflake's business model should consider the stock a high-potential long-term investment idea that could lift a portfolio over the coming decades.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Super Micro Computer provides turn-key AI solutions\n\nArtificial intelligence requires advanced computer systems housed in data centers. But how many companies can build and operate such a system efficiently from the ground up? That's where Super Micro Computer, also doing business as Supermicro, comes in. The company sells turn-key data center systems built on proprietary modular server hardware. Demand for Supermicro's systems has exploded over the past 18 months: SMCI Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe exponential growth has created exponential investment returns. The stock is up over 2,000% over the past three years. Yet, there is a solid argument that the stock isn't expensive today. Shares have come down quite a bit from their 52-week high. Today shares trade at a forward P/E of 33. Management is guiding for 152% year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2024. Meanwhile, analysts believe earnings can grow by over 50% annually for the next three to five years.\n\nOutside data supports this trajectory. According to estimates by Newmark, the demand for U.S. data centers will double between now and 2030. This industrywide growth is a tailwind for Supermicro, and management has stated that it's growing faster than the industry, meaning it's become the go-to for these data center systems, similar to how Nvidia is the go-to for AI chips.\n\nTurning back to Supermicro's valuation, assuming analysts are right about earnings growth moving forward, the stock's current PEG ratio of 0.6 implies that it is a table-pounding bargain for its anticipated growth. Typically, I buy stocks with a PEG ratio under 1.5; anything under 1 is often considered cheap.\n\nThat doesn't guarantee Supermicro delivers on its potential, but even coming somewhat close to expectations could produce massive investment returns for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Snowflake wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Momentum Anomaly Stocks to Bet on as Markets Move Northward",
        "content": "The broader U.S. equity markets witnessed an upward trajectory over the past few trading days in one of the longest winning streaks observed since December 2023, buoyed by the optimism regarding a probable interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in the near future. With weaker-than-expected job growth per the April nonfarm payrolls report and moderating wage gains, investors are pricing in a second rate cut by the end of the year with a nearly 50% likelihood of a 25-basis point rate cut in September.\r\n\r\nRecent data from the nonfarm payrolls report showed job additions of 175,000 in April, well below the broader expectations of 240,000, with wage figures also coming in less than expected. This allayed investor fears that the economy was \u201coverheating\u201d or \u201creaccelerating\u201d and propelled the stocks. In addition, the Middle East ceasefire with Hamas accepting an Egyptian-Qatari proposal to end the war with Israel boosted the stocks. The equity markets were also aided by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments, which largely ruled out a central bank hike in its next policy meeting after holding the rates steady between 5.25% and 5.50% in May. \r\n\r\nAmid the uncertainty, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.\r\n\r\nThis approach primarily tends to follow the adage, \u201cthe trend is your friend.\u201d At its core, momentum investing is \u201cbuying high and selling higher.\u201d It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?\r\n\r\nThere are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, make the momentum strategy work.\r\n\r\nFor example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.\r\n\r\nIn this context, stocks like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI and Leidos Holdings, Inc. LDOS are worth betting on.\r\n\r\nMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child\u2019s play.\r\n\r\nHere, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.\n\nStory continues\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nPercentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.\r\n\r\nPercentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nMomentum Style Score of B or Better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors that include volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.\r\n\r\nCurrent Price greater than $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.\r\n\r\nMarket Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.\r\n\r\nHere are three stocks out of the six that made it through this screen:\r\n\r\nBased in Miami, Royal Caribbean is a cruise company operating three global brands \u2014 Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises.

        "title": "2 Red-Hot Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 81% and 83%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) propelled shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) higher by 506% and 96%, respectively, during the past year. But both stocks still carry a consensus rating of \"buy\" on Wall Street, and certain analysts are forecasting big gains for shareholders.\n\nAnanda Baruah has set Super Micro Computer with a price target of $1,500 per share, implying 81% upside from its current price of $830 per share. Gil Luria at DA Davidson has set SoundHound AI with a price target of $9.50 per share, implying 83% upside from its current price of $5.20 per share.\n\nInvestors should never put too much confidence in price targets, especially price targets set by individual analysts. But Supermicro and SoundHound warrant further consideration given their outperformance.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs and manufactures accelerated computing platforms comprising server and storage systems. The company sources chips, memory, and other hardware from partners like Nvidia and Intel. Its computing platforms are purpose-built for enterprise and cloud data centers, and Supermicro is an early leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) server market, according to Samik Chatterjee at JPMorgan Chase.\n\nSuccess in the AI server market can be attributed to its building block approach to development, which has two major benefits. First, Supermicro can bring servers equipped with the latest chips to market faster than its competitors. Second, those building blocks come together in countless combinations, such that Supermicro offers the broadest and deepest portfolio of advanced server and storage solutions in the IT industry.\n\nSupermicro reported solid financial results in the third fiscal quarter (ended March 31), but shares plunged 15% because it missed consensus sales estimates. To elaborate, revenue increased 200% to $3.85 billion, but Wall Street anticipated $3.95 billion in revenue. Even so, investors may have overreacted given that non-GAAP net income still soared 308% to $6.65 per diluted share, easily beating the $5.78 per dilute share analyst expected.\n\nMoreover, CEO Charles Liang told analysts on the earnings call that Supermicro would have delivered more products during the quarter had it not been supply constrained. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that the midpoint of guidance now implies 110% revenue growth in fiscal 2024. That tops the consensus estimate among analysts, which calls for revenue to increase 106% to $14.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI server market is projected to expand at 47% annually between 2023 and 2028, according to JPMorgan. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts expect Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 47% annually over the next three to five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 46.7 times earnings look reasonable. Supermicro shareholders should not count on an 81% gain in the next year, but investors should consider buying a small position today.\n\n2. SoundHound AI\n\nSoundHound offers conversational intelligence solutions, also called voice artificial intelligence (AI) products, that can be incorporated into all manner of smart devices. Its voice AI technology has applications across the automotive manufacturing, food and beverage, and consumer electronics industries. For instance, its customer base includes well-known brands like Stellantis, Toast, and Qualcomm.\n\nSoundHound is a relatively small business (its market capitalization is under $2 billion) competing against much larger companies like Amazon and Microsoft. But management says it has better technology than its rivals, and that its platform affords brands more flexibility in building differentiated and customized voice AI solutions. Gil Luria at DA Davidson cited that technology-based competitive moat as one reason for his price target of $9.50 per share.\n\nSoundHound is growing like wildfire. Revenue rose 80% to $17 million in the fourth quarter, and the company reported a smaller GAAP loss of $0.07 per diluted share, up from $0.15 per diluted share in the prior year. That progress is encouraging, but SoundHound may have to issue stock or debt in the future. The company burned $68 million last year, and it currently has just $95 million in cash on its balance sheet.\n\nSoundHound recently completed its $25 million acquisition of SYNQ3 Restaurant Solutions, a specialist in conversational intelligence for food and beverage brands. That deal establishes SoundHound as the largest provider of voice AI technology for restaurants and extends it market reach by an order of magnitude, according to CEO Keyvan Mohajer.\n\nLooking ahead, Juniper Research estimates voice AI spending will reach $160 billion by 2026, driven by growing demand across numerous industries. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts think SoundHound will grow sales at 50% annually over the next two years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 26 times sales seem tolerable, though shares are certainly not cheap.\n\nWhile I doubt shareholders will see an 83% gain in the next year, investors should still consider buying a very small position, provided they understand the risks, especially those related to competition. SoundHound may have better voice AI technology, but companies like Amazon and Microsoft have far more resources.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Industrial Stocks to Sell in May Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Industrial stocks have been on a tear, and there are various reasons for optimism. The Biden Administration\u2019s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) authorized spending $850 billion across hundreds of different projects around the nation. Disbursement of that money is already well under way, with a great deal of jobs and economy activity arising as a result; this has been a massive stimulative event for industrial stocks.\n\nIn addition, technological breakthroughs are driving activity in the space. Electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, for example, are two megatrends that are creating numerous opportunities for industrial stocks.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all good news for the sector. High interest rates are likely to serve as a major headwind to the sector going forward. The election this year could slam the brakes on further government investment in infrastructure. And in the hottest sectors, such as AI, sentiment seems to have gotten ahead of itself. All this makes it time to sell these three industrial stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) a private plane inside a hangar is prepared for a flight. represent aerospace stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI\u2019ve been a longtime proponent of GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) stock. That\u2019s because I\u2019m a believer in CEO Larry Culp. Culp built an absolute powerhouse at Danaher (NYSE:DHR) in the early 2000s, and he was just the man for the job of fixing GE.\n\nUnder Culp\u2019s leadership, GE sold or spun off almost all of its businesses, leaving it solely with its flagship aviation operation. Following the recent spin offs of its healthcare and energy divisons, the company renamed itself to GE Aerospace to reflect its new corporate direction. Everything is humming for the company, operationally speaking.\n\nBut at some point, enough is enough. GE stock has now run up from a (split-adjusted) $40 price in 2022 to more than $160 per share today. Even granting GE a sizable quality premium thanks to its CEO, things are still getting out of hand. The company, I\u2019d reiterate, makes and services jet engines. This is not typically the sort of operation whose intrinsic value can quadruple in such a short period.\n\nThe aviation sector \u2013 some individual Boeing (NYSE:BA) technical problems excepted \u2013 is performing quite well right now. Travel demand came soaring back after the pandemic in what some have referred to as revenge spending. Airlines have raced to add capacity, increasing the opportunity for both new jet orders and servicing on existing planes.\n\nI\u2019d argue, however, that the positive sentiment has gone too far. Airlines, for all the positive results right now, remain a deeply cyclical industry. It seems likely that high interest rates and a slowing economy will eventually trip up the travel recovery. Meanwhile, with GE stock now selling at more than 30 times forward earnings, the valuation is quite steep for an industrial aviation company.\n\nStory continues\n\nEaton (ETN) An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nEaton (NYSE:ETN) is an industrial company which offers engineered products primarily to support infrastructure, power solutions, and electrification.\n\nTraditionally, Eaton has served industries such as aerospace and healthcare, offering solutions such as fuel pumps for airplanes and uninterruptable power supplies in medical centers. These sorts of specialized goods with a high cost of failure lead to steady revenues as customers are often reluctant to switch suppliers.\n\nThe legacy businesses aren\u2019t what have the market excited, however. Rather, that\u2019d be Eaton\u2019s smaller but fast-growing operations supplying goods to data centers and the electric vehicle sector.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why investors are enthusiastic, as both of those categories should enjoy strong long-term growth. Data centers in particular are booming right now with the new developments in the generative AI space.\n\nHowever, these revenue categories simply aren\u2019t large enough yet to justify Eaton\u2019s valuation, with shares of this usually sleepy industrial firm now up to 33 times earnings following an 85% rally over the past 12 months.\n\nMorningstar\u2019s Brian Bernard agrees that the current valuation is unsustainable. He sees shares as trading at a\u00a042% premium to fair value today, and he gives Eaton stock a single star rating now, indicating that it is among the industrial stocks to sell.\n\nVertiv Holdings (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nVertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT)\u00a0designs, builds and maintains digital infrastructure. Specifically, it makes and services key components such as coolant systems that go into data centers and telecom networks among other use cases.\n\nLike with Eaton, investors are extrapolating tremendous growth rates for Vertiv going forward. There\u2019s certainly a possible scenario where AI growth maintains an exponential upward curve and Vertiv enjoys essentially unlimited demand.\n\nHowever, investors should also be fully aware of the risk that demand peaks \u2013 or at a minimum growth greatly slows \u2013 in coming quarters. We already saw how fickle the market can be recently with Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), another AI components supplier whose shares plunged on slightly weaker-than-expected earnings.\n\nVertiv shares are up more than 500% over the past year. This has pushed the stock up to 90 times trailing earnings. If you believe the analyst estimates aren\u2019t too optimistic, even then, Vertiv is still around 40 times projected 2024 earnings. If those earnings stop growing \u2013 let alone start going back down \u2013 VRT stock would get absolutely clobbered. Given this possibility, Vertiv is considered among the industrial stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in DHR stock.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this server technology company have returned -10.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, to which Super Micro belongs, has lost 5.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Super Micro is expected to post earnings of $7.95 per share, indicating a change of +126.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.51 points to a change of +99.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $34 indicates a change of +44.6% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +17.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Super Micro is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for SMCI _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate of $5.3 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +142.6%. The $14.93 billion and $23.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +109.7% and +60.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +200%. EPS of $6.65 for the same period compares with $1.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.89%. The EPS surprise was +15.05%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Better AI Stock: Super Micro Computer vs. ASML",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) represent two different ways to invest in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, is one of the world's fastest growing producers of dedicated AI servers. ASML is the world's largest manufacturer of high-end lithography systems, which are used to produce high-end chips for Nvidia, AMD, and other leading chipmakers.\n\nOver the past 12 months, Supermicro's stock has rallied more than 480% as ASML's stock advanced 42%. Let's see why Supermicro outperformed ASML by such a wide margin -- and if it will generate bigger gains for the foreseeable future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe differences between Supermicro and ASML\n\nSupermicro builds high-performance servers which can process tasks more efficiently than traditional servers. Through a longtime partnership, Nvidia grants Supermicro access to its top-tier data center GPUs before its larger competitors.\n\nBy the end of fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), Supermicro was generating more than half of its revenue from its dedicated AI servers. Many data center operators scrambled to install those servers to address the soaring popularity of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nSupermicro controls a much smaller slice of the server market than Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. However, Bank of America expects Supermicro's share of the dedicated AI server market to rise from 10% to 17% within the next three years as the market expands by 150%.\n\nASML's lithography systems are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems which are used to produce the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips. These systems cost about $200 million each and require multiple planes to ship.\n\nThe world's most advanced chipmakers -- TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- all use ASML's EUV systems to produce their top-tier chips. Therefore, TSMC couldn't manufacture Nvidia's latest data center GPUs, AMD's newest CPUs, and other advanced chips without ASML's EUV systems.\n\nThe indispensable nature of ASML's lithography systems makes it linchpin of the global semiconductor market, but tighter export curbs are now preventing it from selling its higher-end systems to Chinese chipmakers. Supermicro's sales of AI servers in China have also been throttled by the ongoing tech war between the U.S. and China.\n\nWhich company is growing faster?\n\nSupermicro's revenue rose 46% in fiscal 2022 and 37% in fiscal 2023 as the market's insatiable demand for new AI servers outstripped its available supply. Analysts expect its revenue to soar another 110% this year and grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 as it expands its share of the AI server market.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML's revenue grew 14% in 2022 and 30% in 2023. It also benefited from the expansion of the AI market, but a lot of that growth was offset by the post-pandemic weakness of the smartphone and PC markets. Therefore, ASML is a more diversified play on the broader semiconductor market than a high-growth AI stock.\n\nAnalysts expect ASML's revenue to stay flat this year as it grapples with the export curbs in China, but they expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 13% from 2023 to 2026 as it rolls out its next-gen EUV systems for making even smaller chips.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Supermicro's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 50%. They expect ASML's EPS to rise at a CAGR of 20% from 2023 to 2026. Based on those estimates, Supermicro trades at 25 times forward earnings while ASML has a much higher forward price-to-earnings ratio of 44.\n\nSupermicro might look more expensive than traditional server makers like Dell and HPE, but it's also growing faster than both of its larger competitors. It also seems reasonably valued relative to other high-growth AI stocks like Nvidia. ASML is trading at a premium to many other semiconductor equipment makers because it's monopolized the EUV market, has plenty of pricing power, and remains a top bellwether of the growing semiconductor sector.\n\nThe better AI stock: Supermicro\n\nSupermicro and ASML are both solid long-term investments, but Supermicro's higher growth rates, tighter focus on the AI market, and lower valuations all make it a more compelling investment than ASML right now. ASML's stock could also gradually head higher, but its near-term gains could be limited until its revenue growth accelerates again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer: Time to Buy This Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock as It Could Soar at Least 41% After Its Latest Pullback",
        "content": "Shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) were in sell-off mode after the company released fiscal 2024 third-quarter results (for the three months ended March 31) on April 30.\n\nThat may seem a tad surprising considering the outstanding growth the company delivered during the quarter. More specifically, Super Micro stock was down more than 11% in pre-market trading on May 1. Investors pushed the panic button as the server manufacturer's revenue was slightly below expectations.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the company's performance will make it clear that Super Micro's drop is a buying opportunity that savvy investors should consider grabbing with both hands. Let's look at the reasons why.\n\nSuper Micro is growing at a red-hot pace\n\nSuper Micro's fiscal Q3 revenue tripled on a year-over-year basis to $3.85 billion. However, that reading was slightly below the consensus estimate of $3.96 billion. Meanwhile, the company's non-GAAP earnings increased to $6.65 per share, a quadruple jump over the year-ago period's figure. What's more, Super Micro's earnings were significantly higher than the consensus estimate of $5.74 per share.\n\nSuper Micro's management credited the outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings to the booming demand for the artificial intelligence (AI) servers that it manufactures. CFO David Weigand remarked on the latest earnings conference call:\n\nQ3 growth was again led by AI GPU platforms which represented more than 50% of revenues with AI GPU customers in both the enterprise and cloud service provider markets. We expect strong growth in Q4 as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins.\n\nThe solid demand for Super Micro's AI servers explains why the company has raised its full-year revenue forecast once again. It now expects to finish fiscal 2024 with revenue of $14.9 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, up from the previous estimate of $14.5 billion. It is worth noting that Super Micro was originally anticipating fiscal 2024 revenue of $10 billion when it released its fiscal 2023 results in August of last year, which means that it has increased its top-line estimate by nearly 50% in nine months.\n\nThe company has generated $9.6 billion in revenue in the first nine months of the ongoing fiscal year. So, it has nearly achieved its original revenue target in just three quarters. The revenue estimate of $5.3 billion for the current quarter further reinforces the fact that the demand for Super Micro's AI servers is set to get stronger with a nice sequential jump in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven better, the company's revenue guidance for the current quarter is higher than the $4.86 billion Street estimate. Super Micro is anticipating $8.02 per share in earnings in the current quarter, which is well above the $7.13 per-share consensus estimate.\n\nAlso, the company's updated full-year revenue guidance means that its top line is on track to jump 110% this year. The non-GAAP earnings guidance of $23.69 per share would be double the previous year's reading of $11.81 per share. All these numbers indicate that selling Super Micro stock based on the small revenue miss may not be a smart move considering that it is set to maintain its red-hot growth by upgrading its production capacity.\n\nInvestors should not miss the bigger picture\n\nThe demand for AI servers is set to rise at a robust pace in the long run. The market was worth an estimated $12.3 billion last year. It is expected to clock annual growth of 26.5% through 2029, generating $50.6 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period. Super Micro Computer's trailing-12-month revenue of $11.8 billion suggests that it is the dominant player in this market.\n\nThe good part is that the company is taking steps to ensure that it remains the top player in AI servers by upgrading its production capacity, as management remarked on the latest earnings conference call:\n\nOur production teams are making aggressive progress on retrofitting the new Silicon Valley facilities and scaling up our Taiwan and Malaysia factories.

        "content": "The stock market was happy to put April behind it. The S&P 500 ended the month 1.6% lower. Will May be any better? A lot depends on the path the Federal Reserve takes on interest rates. While multiple rate cuts are no longer in the cards, any glimmer of hope could send stocks soaring. Inflation continuing to rise, on the other hand, would be a sure-fire damper. This led us to create this list of the hottest S&P 500 stocks.\n\nStill, the broad-based index is up 5% this year and almost half of its constituent components performed as well or better than the average.\n\nThe following three companies are the hottest S&P 500 stocks on the market, significantly outperforming the index. Should you back up the truck or take money off the table? Let\u2019s dive in to see?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt might be a little confusing for investors to see the GE ticker symbol but see the company name GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE). That\u2019s because the old General Electric split itself into two separately traded companies. One was the aerospace division, which retained the legacy ticker, and the renewable energy business was renamed GE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) and got a new ticker symbol (GEV). The old GE that people knew is no more.\n\nHowever, as investors prepared for a different kind of halving event, GE stock soared. Shares are up 59.8% in 2024, good enough for a third-place showing.\n\nGE Aerospace had $32 billion in revenue last year with 70% generated by services. It starts its new life as an independent company with an installed base of 44,000 commercial engines and 26,000 military and defense engines globally. GE Aerospace believes it can achieve $10 billion in operating profit by 2028.\n\nGeneral Electric was founded in 1892 as the merger between Thomas Edison\u2019s Edison General Electric and two other electric companies. It eventually grew into a major industrial conglomerate. But over the years it divested many of its businesses and today has a different purpose and trajectory ahead of it.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot surprising to many, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be a massive growth story. Shares are up 69.5% this year, continuing to pad the lead it posted in 2023. The chipmaker is powered by artificial intelligence (AI), and though it is down from the all-time highs hit last month, the market still expects Nvidia stock to grow further this year.\n\nFourth quarter revenue was $22.1 billion, a 265% from the year-ago figure and well ahead of management\u2019s forecast of $20 billion. That was due to companies building next-gen data centers, or what Nvidia calls \u201cAI factories.\u201d It now expects Q1 revenue to be $24 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there is a good chance investors will experience a lot more volatility with the stock. Rockets like the chipmaker will run into instances when it just can\u2019t keep up with demand and those shortfalls will wreak havoc around earnings time. The business remains solid but because expectations of peak performance are built into the stock price, anything even slightly underwhelming will send shares lower.\n\nNvidia is priced for perfection. At 69 times trailing earnings and 34 times sales, NVDA stock is not cheap. That doesn\u2019t mean it is a bad company, but you may wish to find other opportunities that offer better valuations or smoother forward progress.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to see an overreaction, look at what\u2019s happening to Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). While it is still the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 with shares soaring 149% in 2024, that was after a 17% pullback in the stock after \u201cmissing\u201d earnings.\n\nMind you, Super Micro\u2019s revenues tripled in its fiscal third quarter while profits quadrupled from last year. But because Wall Street was looking for even greater sales, the stock plummeted on the news.\n\nThat is the type of situation investors should pounce on. It is obvious the maker of AI-optimized servers, storage and equipment for data centers is on fire with more demand for its product than it knows what to do with. That is blistering growth that should not have been punished.\n\nThere is no let up in demand for data centers. Not even if the economy were to fall into a recession would the demand ebb. Hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are undergoing a demand wave themselves and are building out their own data center footprint. Because Super Micro\u2019s equipment is essential to their proper working, look for its stock to quickly regain the lost ground and advance once again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSuper Micro Computer's estimated fair value is US$1,052 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Super Micro Computer is estimated to be 26% undervalued based on current share price of US$783 Analyst price target for SMCI is US$1,007 which is 4.3% below our fair value estimate\n\nHow far off is Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nView our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nThe Model\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  -US$950.7m US$774.2m US$1.50b US$2.14b US$2.78b US$3.39b US$3.93b US$4.40b US$4.79b US$5.13b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x7 Analyst x6 Analyst x6 Est @ 42.02% Est @ 30.13% Est @ 21.80% Est @ 15.98% Est @ 11.90% Est @ 9.04% Est @ 7.04% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8%  -US$882 US$666 US$1.2k US$1.6k US$1.9k US$2.2k US$2.3k US$2.4k US$2.4k US$2.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16b\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.8%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$5.1b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.8%\u2013 2.4%) = US$96b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$96b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$45b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$62b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$783, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Super Micro Computer as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.184. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings.\n\nWeakness\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "title": "Meet the Newest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock in the S&amp;P 500. It Soared 1,700% in 2 Years, and Wall Street Says the Stock Is Still a Buy",
        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market. The index includes 500 large-cap companies, currently defined as companies worth at least $18 billion, and it covers about 80% of domestic equities by market capitalization. To be considered for inclusion, a company must also be profitable, and its stock must be sufficiently liquid.\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) became the newest artificial intelligence (AI) company in the S&P 500 when it joined the index in March 2024, little more than a year after it joined the S&P MidCap 400 in December 2022. Meanwhile, shares soared over 1,700% over the last two years as strong demand for AI computing products fueled rapid sales growth.\n\nThe stock still carries a consensus rating of \"buy\" among Wall Street analysts, and the median price target of $965 per share implies 26% upside from its current price of $762 per share. Here's what investors should know about Supermicro.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is gaining share in the AI server market\n\nSuper Micro Computer develops accelerated computing platforms, such as storage and servers for enterprise and cloud-data centers, purpose-built for use cases like 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Its platforms integrate the latest chips, memory, and storage solutions from suppliers like Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Nvidia, such that Supermicro offers customers a high degree of flexibility in customizing their computing products.\n\nAdditionally, the company has a unique building-block approach to product development. It can usually integrate the latest technologies into its servers and bring them to market before other manufacturers. On the recent earnings call, CEO Charles Liang told analysts, \"We provide optimized AI solutions at scale, offering a time-to-market advantage and shorter lead times over our competition.\"\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America think that competitive advantage will boost its market share in artificial intelligence servers, such that Supermicro accounts for 17% of sales in 2026, up from 10% in 2023.\n\nJim Kelleher at Argus is also bullish. \"We believe Supermicro has a head start on the legacy server vendors and is the partner of choice with Nvidia and other industry leaders for AI implementations,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"Supermicro is emerging as a go-to provider for data-center implementation of GPU computing infrastructure used in training large language models (LLMs), inference, deep learning, and other elements that enable generative AI applications.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer suffered a small setback in the third quarter\n\nSupermicro shares plunged 15% when the company reported third-quarter financial results that missed estimates on the top line, but investors may have overreacted. Revenue increased 200% to $3.8 billion during the quarter, just short of the 209% growth Wall Street anticipated. However, non-GAAP net income still surged 308% to $6.65 per diluted share, easily topping the 255% growth that analysts forecasted.\n\nRegarding the light revenue, Supermicro would have delivered more products had it not been supply constrained, according to CEO Charles Liang. Indeed, management reported record demand for liquid-cooled, full-rack AI systems, and the company was first to market with products featuring Nvidia's new Grace Blackwell GB200 processors, which pair one Grace CPU and two Blackwell GPUs.\n\nMoreover, Supermicro actually raised its full-year revenue outlook. Guidance at the midpoint now implies 110% sales growth in fiscal 2024, which ends on June 30. The company previously forecasted 104% sales growth, and Wall Street had penciled in 106% sales growth. In short, Supermicro sees itself on a loftier growth trajectory than it did before Q3, so the recent drawdown looks like a buying opportunity.\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock trades at a surprisingly reasonable valuation\n\nThe AI server market is forecasted to grow at 47% annually between 2023 and 2028, according to JPMorgan Chase. Supermicro is well positioned to benefit from that tailwind. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 49% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nThat consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 42.7 times earnings look very reasonable. I say that because its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which compares the price-to-earnings ratio to forecasted earnings growth, is currently below 1. For context, Nvidia currently has a PEG ratio of 2, and Amazon and Microsoft have PEG ratios of 2.2 and 2.5, respectively.\n\nOf course, shares could sink if the company grows earnings more slowly than Wall Street anticipates. But patient investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying a small position in Supermicro, the newest AI stock in the S&P 500.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly called Supermicro, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Heading into the company's earnings report, the stock had gained more than 700% over the preceding year, so expectations were high.\n\nDespite stellar results, investors wanted more, and the stock slumped 14% in a single day.\u00a0One analyst thinks the selling has simply gone too far.\n\nToo much is never enough\n\nIn the wake of its drubbing earlier this week, Barclays analyst George Wang raised his price target on Supermicro to $1,000 while maintaining an overweight (buy) rating on the shares. That represents potential upside of 31% compared to the stock's closing price on Thursday. The analyst cited Supermicro's robust results and strong guidance as fueling his optimism.\n\nThe analyst has a point. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), Supermicro generated record revenue of $3.85 billion that surged 200% year over year. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.65, which soared 308%. CEO Charles Liang noted that not only had the company gained market share, but he expected that trend to continue.\n\nFurthermore, Supermicro increased its full-year guidance such that it expects revenue to grow 109% at the midpoint of its guidance. That hardly seems like a reason to sell.\n\nWang pointed out that the numbers point to sequential revenue increases in each of the coming two quarters, which will be bolstered by supply chain improvements and AI-fueled tailwinds.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, and as a result of its drubbing, Supermicro stock is currently selling for less than 2 times forward sales, giving savvy investors the opportunity to pick up this AI superstar at a bargain. But don't expect this sale to last long.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is wrapping up its two busiest weeks of earnings reports this quarter, with more than half of the index reporting results. Companies have largely surprised to the upside, with the index pacing at earnings growth of 5.5% this quarter, per Evercore ISI.\n\nStock reactions have been mixed, though, as the prospect of interest rates remaining high for longer than expected hangs over markets and many companies struggle to impress investors given the market's roaring rally going into the reporting period.\n\nBelow we break down some of the key companies that have reported this season.\n\nTesla\n\nTesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 10% on the day following its earnings report despite the company missing Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and earnings per share in the prior quarter. Instead of a fundamentals story, CEO Elon Musk caught investor attention with an announcement that the company would accelerate its launch of a low-cost vehicle.\n\nMusk also emphasized the company's role in the AI world, highlighting that the company will be a leader in autonomous ridesharing.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock soared more than 10% after the company announced its first-ever cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The board of directors also approved stock repurchases of up to an additional $70 billion.\n\nThe company's stock surpassed $2 trillion following the report. Trade fair visitors walk past a Google logo at the Google stand at Hannover Messe 2024. (Photo by Julian Stratenschulte/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nMeta\n\nThe Facebook parent company had a different earnings reaction than its tech counterparts. The stock fell more than 10% after the midpoint of itscurrent quarter revenue guidance range came in light compared to the Street's expectations.\n\nSpending was also a key concern among investors, as Meta (META) said it expects the company's full-year total expenses to come in between $96 billion and $99 billion, up from a range of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\n\nAcross all of Big Tech, spending was a large focus of quarterly reports as companies announced plans to increase capital expenditures amid the AI spending rush.\n\nStarbucks\n\nThe coffee chain reported a dismal quarter of financial results, missing Wall Street's estimates across the board. Key metrics that came into focus were an 11% decline in China sales (the Street had been expecting a 1.62% decline) and a 6% decline in foot traffic compared to the 0.27% decline the Street had expected.\n\nStarbucks stock (SBUX) fell almost 16% the next day.\n\nJetBlue\n\nThe low-cost airline carrier announced it expects revenue in the current quarter to fall in a range of 6.5% to 10.5%, potentially more than double analyst estimates of a 3.8% drop. Full-year revenue is expected to fall to the low single digits compared to the prior expectation of flat sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nJetBlue stock (JBLU) tanked in reaction, with shares falling almost 20% in the subsequent trading day.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, AMD, Intel\n\nThe magnitude of AI enthusiasm appeared to weigh on stocks in the chip space. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock, which had been up more than 700% over the last year, sank by double digits after the company reported revenue slightly below Wall Street's estimates for the prior quarter. Notably, Super Micro's revenue guidance for the current quarter, which was in a range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, well above Wall Street's estimates of $4.89 billion, wasn't enough to prevent the stock drop.\n\nHigh expectations plagued others in the AI chip trade too. AMD (AMD) topped Wall Street's expectations for revenue and earnings per share in the current quarter, but investors appeared more concerned that the company's Q2 revenue forecast came in lighter than analyst estimates.\n\nA similar story played out for fellow chipmaker Intel (INTC), whose revenue guidance for the current quarter fell short of Wall Street's expectations.\n\nCarvana\n\nCarvana stock (CVNA) soared more than 30% as the company reported a surprise profit for the prior quarter. The company reported quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $0.23 versus expectations for a loss of $0.80. Revenue came in at $3.06 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $2.76 billion.\n\nSnap, Pinterest\n\nShares of Snap (SNAP) jumped more than 30% after the company issued a more upbeat sales forecast than Wall Street had expected. Pinterest (PINS) also saw a significant stock bump after it topped Wall Street's expectations for adjusted earnings per share and revenue in the prior quarter.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Despite exceeding their quarterly earnings expectations on Tuesday evening, AMD AMD and Super Micro Computer\u2019s SMCI stock fell sharply in yesterday\u2019s trading session. Still, corrections can be healthy and Super Micro shares have skyrocketed an astonishing +451% over the last year with AMD up +79%.\n\nThat said, investors may be wondering if there was an overreaction in the market and if it\u2019s time to buy the post-earnings dip in these AI leaders with SMCI rebounding and rising +3% on Thursday and AMD up +1%.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOverview\n\nGiven Nvidia\u2019s NVDA stellar growth amid high demand for AI chips, investors may have been looking for more from AMD\u2019s Q1 report. However, earnings of $0.62 per share did beat expectations that called for Q1 EPS to be at $0.60 a share and flat from the comparative quarter. Quarterly sales of $5.47 billion came in 1% above estimates and rose 2% from $5.35 billion in Q1 2023.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTurning to Super Micro, the optimized server solutions provider had very lofty expectations given the mind-boggling price appreciation in its stock which has mirrored Nvidia's stellar performance. The company\u2019s hype and growth have been substantial as Super Micro is an original equipment manufacturer of servers that can harvest AI.\n\nSuper Micro posted earnings of $6.65 per share for its fiscal third quarter beating expectations of $5.78 a share by 15%. More impressive, Super Micro\u2019s Q3 EPS soared over 300% from $1.63 a share in the prior-year quarter. However, Q3 sales of $3.85 billion missed estimates of $3.96 billion by -3% although this was a 200% increase from $1.28 billion a year ago. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Trajectories\n\nBased on Zacks estimates, AMD\u2019s annual earnings are currently projected to increase 30% in fiscal 2024 and are forecasted to jump another 47% in FY25 to $5.06 per share. Total sales are forecasted to rise 11% this year and projected to climb another 23% in FY25 to $30.97 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPivoting to Super Micro, annual earnings are now expected to soar 85% in FY24 to $21.88 per share compared to $11.81 a share in 2023. Fiscal 2025 EPS is slated to jump another 35% to $29.51. Furthermore, Super Micro\u2019s total sales are slated to increase 103% in FY24 and are projected to soar another 35% next year to $19.5 billion.

        "title": "Nomura, Mizuho Face $108 Million Loss After Fund\u2019s Failed Trades",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nomura Holdings Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. are facing more than $100 million of potential losses tied to a series of failed stock trades made by investment fund All Blue Capital.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS and Saudis Near Defense Pact Meant to Reshape Middle East Biden Calls Ally Japan \u2018Xenophobic\u2019 Along With China, Russia Saudi Arabia Steps Up Arrests Of Those Attacking Israel Online Huawei Secretly Backs US Research, Awarding Millions in Prizes Tesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market\n\nAll Blue, led by trader Matt Novak, made a series of wrong-way short bets with multiple counterparties earlier this year and was allegedly unable to settle the trades, according to New York legal filings and people familiar with the matter. Two units of the fund were placed into liquidation in the British Virgin Islands in March, the filings show.\n\nThe fund\u2019s inability to settle its bets triggered a chain of events that has left Tokyo-based Nomura nursing a possible loss of 14 billion yen ($89 million), the people said. Mizuho has separately claimed All Blue owes it $19 million that it has yet to repay, according to the filings, which are part of an ongoing legal action that Mizuho has taken in New York. The fund is contesting the lawsuit.\n\nThe size of the potential losses raises questions about the risk management practices at two of Japan\u2019s largest banks. Wall Street giants around the world have been under pressure to improve their monitoring of high-risk investment funds. Nomura has spent years repairing its internal controls after losing almost $3 billion on the collapse of Archegos Capital Management in 2021, an affair that also saddled Mizuho with losses.\n\nSpokespeople for Nomura and Mizuho declined to comment. A lawyer for All Blue said the company will vigorously defend itself against Mizuho\u2019s claims. Novak did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nNomura\u2019s Provision\n\nLast month, Nomura said it had set aside funds to cover the potential loss. The provision weighed on the banking giant\u2019s results in the first quarter, leading the firm\u2019s European subsidiary to post a pretax loss for the period.\n\nAt the time, Chief Financial Officer Takumi Kitamura said an \u201cincident\u201d had occurred at the bank\u2019s Instinet subsidiary involving a UK broker that made an order for a stock trade. That broker is Avalon Capital Partners, a London-based firm that arranged some of the transactions on All Blue\u2019s behalf, the people said.\n\n\u201cWe are currently conducting various investigations to recover the debt,\u201d Kitamura said, without elaborating. \u201cAll transactions with that broker have been settled, and all losses arising from this transaction have been booked in the quarter.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Nomura Took $89 Million Hit at Instinet Brokerage Arm, CFO Says\n\nA spokesperson for Avalon, which was co-founded by Jean-Yves Aknin, told Bloomberg in an emailed statement that a client \u201cfailed to settle a number of trades\u201d in February and that the firm notified the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority \u201cimmediately.\u201d The spokesperson did not identify the client and declined to comment further.\n\nBrokerage firms like Avalon operate as middlemen in the world of Wall Street trading, matching buyers and sellers. It\u2019s typically the responsibility of their end clients to deliver the shares or cash that settle trades.\n\nAll Blue\n\nNovak, a former emerging-markets trader at Commerzbank AG, is managing partner at All Blue, which invests across private equity, venture capital, real estate and other assets. The fund has also agreed to participate in a convertible debt offering tied to Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special-purpose acquisition company that merged with former US President Donald Trump\u2019s social-media firm, according to the Financial Times.\n\nIn 2022, Novak said he moved All Blue\u2019s headquarters to Dubai, part of the growing class of hedge funds choosing to expand in the Middle Eastern business hub.\n\nMizuho lodged its claim against All Blue in New York in March, alleging the fund failed to settle its debts and evaded communications. The fund, which denies any wrongdoing, has responded by describing the Japanese bank as a \u201cdisgruntled purported unsecured creditor\u201d seeking to \u201ccut in line ahead of other creditors and investors,\u201d filings show.\n\nMizuho\u2019s Lawsuit\n\nAll Blue opened an account with Mizuho\u2019s US arm late last year, according to the bank\u2019s lawsuit. In February, the fund placed a bet that the stock of Super Micro Computer Inc., a San Jose, California-based server maker, would decline in value using 190,000 of the firm\u2019s shares.\n\nSuper Micro\u2019s shares have soared more than 150% this year and the stock gained 64% in February alone. A jump in demand for the equipment that powers artificial intelligence applications has caused the company\u2019s revenue to surge.\n\nNovak\u2019s firm failed to repay all the securities, leaving Mizuho with a $19-million loss, according to the filings. Mizuho officials struggled to track down Novak as they went looking for their money, according to the claim.\n\nLawyers acting for All Blue told the court in recent weeks that a unit of the fund had been liquidated toward the end of March. Novak signed off on the entity closing down and the insolvency is being handled by practitioners at R&H Restructuring, according to a letter produced for the proceedings.\n\n\u201cTrader Matt [Novak] has been offline in chats all week,\u201d one Mizuho banker said in emails discussing the trade, weeks after it was supposed to be settled. \u201cWe cannot connect with him.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "title": "Should You Buy the Dip in Semiconductor Stocks With ETFs?",
        "content": "The semiconductor sector, which was riding high on AI optimism, faltered last month on growing concerns about the long-term demand outlook for semiconductors and weak demand from China. The series of weak earnings from AI players like Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Super Micro Computer SMCI was the latest blow, resulting in a sell-off in the broader sector on May 1. Notably, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.5% on the day (read: Can Q1 Earnings Results Recharge Semiconductor ETFs?).\n\nInside the Slump\n\nAMD offered downbeat guidance for 2024 sales of its newly released AI chip, which pushed the stock down 9%. Though the company raised its revenue target for MI300 to at least $4 billion from $3.5 billion, Wall Street was looking for a bigger boost from the accelerator business. At least 12 analysts cut their price targets on AMD stock after the company's first-quarter report. However, some analysts are still positive about the company\u2019s growth prospects. They believe that easing supply chain constraints would allow the company to increase its share in the AI chip market and potentially reap billions of dollars in revenues.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer plunged 14% following its revenue miss amid concerns over the profitability of a new line of servers. However, some analysts raised the target price on the stock following its results, stating that AI is still in the early stages and will continue to grow.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the duo caused some disappointment, resulting in a decline in other semiconductor stocks. Nvidia NVDA, which is at the forefront of AI innovations, fell 5.7%. Notably, the three stocks erased a collective $143 billion in market value. Chipmakers like Micron Technology MU and Marvell Technology MRVL slid 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively (read: What's Ahead for Nvidia ETFs?).\r\n\r\nSkyworks SWKS stock tumbled 15.3% after the company provided weak revenue guidance on demand concerns as clients struggled to offload excess inventory.\n\nETF Impact\n\nThe terrible trading in the stock world sent the semiconductor ETFs space into red on the day. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL have lost around 3% each on the day.\r\n\r\nSMH\r\n\r\nVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF follows the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index and holds 26 stocks in its basket. It favors the largest companies in the industry. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF has managed assets worth $18.3 billion and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses.\r\n\r\nSOXX\r\n\r\niShares Semiconductor ETF tracks the NYSE Semiconductor Index and holds 30 securities in its basket. It has amassed $12.6 billion in its asset base and charges a fee of 35 bps a year from investors.\r\n\r\nSOXQ\r\n\r\nInvesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to the largest U.S.-listed securities of companies engaged in the semiconductor business. It tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, holding 30 stocks in its basket. It has accumulated $364 million in its asset base and charges 19 bps in annual fees.\r\n\r\nSHOC\r\n\r\nStrive U.S. Semiconductor ETF seeks broad market exposure to the U.S. semiconductor sector. It follows the Solactive United States Semiconductors 30 Capped Index and holds 32 stocks in its basket. Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF has AUM of $59.1 million and charges 40 bps in annual fees.\r\n\r\nFTXL\r\n\r\nFirst Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to the most-liquid U.S. semiconductor securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Semiconductor Index. FTXL holds 31 stocks in its basket and charges 60 bps in annual fees. First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF has $1.4 billion in AUM.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s Ahead?\n\nDespite the slide, the outlook for the sector is promising. The semiconductor index is still clearly outpacing the broader market index on a year-to-date basis. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 8% in the year-to-date time frame compared with a gain of 5.2% for the S&P 500. The sector is also enjoying a strong rally over the past year, gaining more than 53% compared with 23.6% for the S&P 500.\r\n\r\nThis trend is likely to continue thanks to the rapid development of AI, which will continue to fuel a surge in demand for semiconductor products, driven by its applications in data processing, pattern recognition and machine learning. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to $811.75 billion by 2030 (read: 4 ETFs to Tap the Renewed AI Craze on Wall Street).\r\n\r\nSemiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life, from cars and electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. Demand will continue to trend higher, given increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail, among others. The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth. Further, the introduction of expensive and new-generation chips has been driving an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.\r\n\r\nFurther, the abovementioned five ETFs have a top Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), suggesting that these will outperform the broad market. Additionally, these products have exposure to a number of firms in various types of industries, suggesting that these can easily counter shocks from some of the industry\u2019s biggest components.\r\n\r\nGiven the strong industry fundamentals and the diversification benefits of ETFs, investors may want to consider the recent slump a buying opportunity.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Chip Stocks on Sale: 3 Semiconductor Plays to Buy the Dip",
        "content": "Chip stocks pulled back following an earnings report by ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), a prominent semiconductor manufacturing equipment developer, which said it expects its bookings to see a significant 61% sequential decrease in the first quarter.\n\nThis downturn surpassed what investors had anticipated, causing concern in the semiconductor market. This slowdown in equipment purchases by foundries, that manufacture chips for companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could indicate a potential downturn in the semiconductor industry, which is what is hurting chip stocks lately.\n\nThe semiconductor sector was further shaken by a global retreat in semiconductor stocks, prompted by profit-taking after TSMC revised its chip market growth forecast downwards. The revision by TSMC, from over 10% to 10% growth for the global logic semiconductor industry, is fueling concerns over the demand for chips used in various technologies including electric vehicles, computers, and smartphones.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the latest pullback, let\u2019s look at three chip stocks investors may want to buy on dips.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) produces DRAM, flash memory, and SSDs, which are essential for everything from smartphones to data centers. This positive performance has made Micron a standout in the broader chip stocks category.\n\nInvestors should use the recent pullback in Micron as an opportunity.\n\nMicron reported an unexpected profit for its second quarter, signaling a quicker-than-anticipated recovery in the memory chip market. It also transitioned to a profit of $793 million. That was a substantial turnaround from the $2.31 billion loss reported in the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company earned 71 cents per share, defying analysts\u2019 expectations of a per-share loss of 41 cents, according to polls by FactSet. Adjusted earnings per share stood at 42 cents, outperforming the consensus forecast of a 25-cent loss.\n\nThe company enjoyed a 58% increase in revenue, reaching $5.82 billion, which surpassed analyst predictions. In addition, Micron\u2019s Chief Executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, attributed this success to the company\u2019s effective execution in terms of pricing, products, and operations.\n\nLooking ahead, the company\u2019s revenue forecast ranges from $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion, which exceeds the consensus expectations of $6 billion. This optimistic outlook further underscores the company\u2019s recovery trajectory in the competitive memory chip market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) used to be known for creating powerful graphics chips for gaming PCs and workstations. However, the unprecedented demand for high-end AI chips is what propelled the company\u2019s market capitalization to over $2 trillion at one point.\n\nWithin a single year, Nvidia gained a 260% valuation boost, increasing its market cap by $1.6 trillion. That is more than double the combined market cap of Nvidia\u2019s three closest competitors. Their chips accelerate tasks in AI, data science, and self-driving cars.\n\nNvidia shares are already up 77% but were recently trading below highs following a pullback in the chip sector. Still, investors are very likely to continue seeing Nvidia as the clear artificial intelligence (AI) winner as long as the company can maintain its ~90% market share in this market.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock was also boosted when Citi analysts opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on the chipmaker. According to the firm, recent supply chain checks showed that Nvidia\u2019s visibility has extended into 1H25, which makes it a long-term core portfolio holding.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), is a big name in high-performance server tech. The company designs and sells servers, storage, and other hardware needed for data centers and powerful computing systems. As part of the broader chip stocks sector, SMCI\u2019s role is crucial for advanced computing needs.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock fell as much as 23% in a single day in April after the maker of servers announced the date of its third-quarter results but didn\u2019t pre-announce results. This disappointed investors as they were hoping SMCI could opt to pre-announcer results amid better-than-expected performance in the first quarter.\n\nNevertheless, the SMCI\u2019s strong fundamental profile remains intact. The selloff is more connected to heightened investor expectations than to the change in the company\u2019s performance. In recent months, SMCI stock has rallied on the back of the generative AI boom. Investors see SMCI well-positioned amid strong demand for its AI-centric server technology.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) just announced a blowout quarter. Sort of. Super Micro's fast-growing sales increased 5% sequentially from the previous quarter but exploded by more than 200% compared to the prior-year period.\n\nThat's because Super Micro is in the business of providing server and storage system components to data centers building artificial intelligence (AI) capacity. And its bottom-line earnings expanded even more than sales in the quarter. But investors sold the stock in droves anyway today for a couple of reasons.\n\nPredicting the future for Super Micro\n\nOne big reason the stock tanked after earnings is that it had already soared by more than 700% over the last year as investors anticipated the huge jump in sales. Another is that the costs to generate those growing sales are increasing even faster.\n\nSuper Micro's gross margin dropped from 17.6% in the year-ago period to 15.5% this year. That's because there's growing competition in this fast-moving sector. Neither Super Micro nor its competitors make the powerful semiconductor chips needed for AI applications. They assemble the systems that include those chips to install in the booming data center market.\n\nBut that data center growth is exploding along with the growth in AI use cases. That's why Super Micro increased its sales guidance and expects revenue to more than double for its fiscal year 2024 (ended June 30) versus last year.\n\nThe AI data center supercycle is driving Super Micro's sales and earnings. Even competitors like Dell Technologies are seeing their backlogs double for their AI server business. When the cycle comes to an end, though, the stock of a pure play like Super Micro could drop as fast as it has soared in the last year.\n\nFor investors adept at closely following the business and the macro environment, Super Micro could make a great investment after today's decline. But those who take a more hands-off investing approach might want to pass on this volatile name.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Crashed and Burned Wednesday Morning",
        "content": "The past year has seen an extraordinary run for high-end server and storage solution specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro. Prior to the company's latest quarterly report, which it released after the market close on Tuesday, the stock had gained more than 700% over the past year, driven higher by accelerating demand for artificial intelligence (AI) systems and the hardware to power them.\n\nHowever, gravity may have finally caught up with Supermicro. Despite robust results and increased guidance, investors engaged in a round of profit-taking Wednesday morning that drove the stock down by as much as 18.5%. As of 11:50 a.m. ET, the stock was still down by 15.8%.\n\nSometimes, fabulous isn't good enough\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended March 31, Supermicro's revenues surged 200% year over year to $3.85 billion. Expanding profit margins sent even more to the bottom line: Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared by 308% to $6.65. Analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $3.95 billion and EPS of $5.78, so while profits were stronger than expected, sales were a little shy of expectations.\n\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Charles Ling noted that Supermicro continues to \"face some supply chain challenges,\" particularly involving components for its direct liquid-cooled servers. These servers are in high demand from cloud service providers and data center operators as they scramble to meet the accelerating demand for hardware capable of powering generative AI. These shortages likely contributed to slightly lower-than-expected revenue growth. That said, he expects the bottlenecks to ease in the coming quarters.\n\nLing also reminded investors that this was \"another record quarter\" and said, \"We expect to continue gaining market share.\"\n\nIncreased guidance\n\nIn the wake of the company's rapid growth recently, management boosted the full-year revenue outlook to a range of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion. Previously it had guided for a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. If it hits the midpoint of the revised forecast, Supermicro will deliver year-over-year top-line growth of 109%.\n\nGiven Supermicro's triple-digit percentage growth and robust guidance, the stock remains attractively priced, trading at roughly 2 times expected forward sales. However, this AI transition is still in its early stages, and the road ahead is likely to be long and volatile. Investors should ignore the noise and buy Supermicro for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "AI chip darling AMD struggles to impress Wall Street this earnings season",
        "content": "AMD's (AMD) latest round of quarterly results reminded investors that not all chipmakers are going to see Nvidia (NVDA) like growth amid the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe chipmaker reported it expects current quarter revenue in a range of $5.4 billion to $6 billion, in line with Wall Street's estimates for $5.7 billion.\n\nBut shares fell more than 9% Wednesday morning, reflecting that in line reports might not be enough for AI investors after more than a 70% run up in AMD stock over the past year.\n\nSpecifically, Wall Street analysts noted that the outlook for AI growth within AMD might not be as robust as some had hoped.\n\nIn a note cutting his price target to $185 from $195, Bank of America research analyst Vivek Arya wrote that AMD bulls might've been disappointed in the company's forecast for MI300 chips in 2024, which came in at $4 billion. While an increase from the prior guide of $3 billion, Arya noted that it felt short of more optimistic outlooks for a range of $5 to $6 billion.\n\nThis comes in contrast to Nvidia's recent run of AI dominance where the company has consistently surprised Wall Street's lofty expectations.\n\n\"We believe NVDA's vertical integration across systems/software will remain tough for AMD to beat,\" Arya wrote.\n\nWedbush analyst Matt Bryson reasoned the price reaction in AMD was investors failing to see the \"forest through the trees\" in the AI story.\n\nBut AMD's move mirrored other drops in chipmaker stocks on Wednesday, pointing to a slowdown in investor enthusiasm around the AI trade, particularly in names that have rallied heavily over the past year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) shares, which had been up more than 700% over the past year, fell more than 17% on Wednesday after the company reported quarterly revenue of $3.85 billion \u2014 short of Wall Street's estimates for $3.95 billion but still reflecting about 200% growth compared the same period a year prior. The company also boosted its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, up from a prior range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion.\n\nStill, the broader chip sector fell on the news from both companies, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index sliding more than 2.5% during morning trading on Wednesday.\n\nThe moves speak to a broader trend Citi strategist Drew Pettit told Yahoo Finance he expects to emerge this quarter in areas like semiconductors, where stock valuations have recently soared.\n\n\"You don't just need a beat [on earnings and revenue estimates] and hold [on guidance], you need a beat and raise and confidence in the very long-term trajectory of these companies,\" Citi strategist Drew Pettit told Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory continues Lisa Su, president and CEO of AMD, gives a keynote address during the 2019 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., January 9, 2019.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 30, 2024\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Joel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Super Micro Computer Fiscal Q3 2024 Results on April 30, 2024. With us today are Charles Liang, Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer; David Weigand, CFO; and Michael Staiger, Vice President of Corporate Development. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\n\nMichael Staiger: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending Supermicro's call to discuss financial results for the third quarter, which ended March 31, 2024. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. As a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the Investor -- excuse me, under the Events & Presentations tab. We have published management's scripted commentary on our website.\n\nPlease note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, and other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and the full fiscal year 2024. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Supermicro's future results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal '23, and our other SEC filings. All of these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Supermicro's website.\n\nWe assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Most of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. I'll now turn the call over to Charles.\n\nStory continues\n\nCharles Liang: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We achieved another record-breaking quarter, with revenue of $3.85 billion, a 200% increase from same time last year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.65, up more than 308% year-on-year. Supermicro is at the forefront of the current AI revolution. These strong results reflect the continued demand for our rack-scale plug-and-play total AI solutions. We continue to face some supply chain challenges due to new products that require new key components, especially, DLC-related components, and believe this situation will gradually improve in the coming quarters. To sustain this rapid growth, we are making significant investments in production, operation, management software, cloud features and customer service to further increase our customer base and bring more value to them.\n\nTo support this scale-up, we raised an additional $3.28 billion through a convertible note and secondary equity offering in the quarter. We like to support strong short- and long-term growth with minimal equity dilution. Overall, I remain optimistic that AI growth will continue for many quarters, if not many years to come. We have long recognized that AI is accelerating the need for liquid cooling, and we have invested heavily into high quality, optimized direct liquid cooling, DLC, solutions for high-end CSPs and NCPs. With GPUs reaching 700 watts and soon more than 1,000 watts, efficiently managing the heat from these AI systems has become critical for many customers, especially at the new data centers. I am pleased to announce that our new DLC liquid cooling building blocks and rack scale total solution technology are finally ready for high volume production.\n\nWith our DLC liquid cooling technology, customers can reduce their expense on cooling [expense] (ph), saving data center space, and allocate a greater portion of their finite power resources to computing instead of cooling, which aligns with our green computing DNA. Now, let's go over some key financial highlights. Supermicro is pleased to be included in the prestigious S&P 500 Index last quarter. Fiscal Q3 net revenue totaled $3.85 billion, up 200% year-on-year, within our aggressive original guidance of March quarter. If not limited by some key component shortages, we could have delivered more. Fiscal Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $6.65 per share were well above $1.63 last year, which was above 308% year-on-year growth. Our increasing economies of scale contributed to better net profit.\n\nOur year-over-year operating margin and net income both continue to improve, and we continue to expect further benefits as we bring our Malaysia facility online later in this calendar year. This fast-growing quarter was driven by end users wanting to accelerate their deployment of the latest generation AI platforms. Through our Building Block Solutions, we provide optimized AI solutions at scale, offering a time-to-market advantage and shorter lead time over our competition. Additionally, our rack-scale plug-and-play total solutions, especially with liquid cooling DLC, ensure optimal system performance while saving energy cost up to 40% at data center scale, delivering much more value to customers. We are leading the AI revolution by deploying NVIDIA HGX H100 SuperCluster solutions to our customers, housed in our new 100 kilowatt racks, with 2 times to 3 times higher power density than traditional racks from others.\n\nAt NVIDIA GTC last month, we unveiled our next-generation Blackwell products, including the GB200 NVL72 solution. To further grow our AI portfolio, we are now strongly focused on developing new generative AI and inference-optimized systems based on the upcoming next-generation NVIDIA H200, B100, B200, GH200 and GB200 GPUs as well as Intel Gaudi2, Gaudi3 and AMD MI300X and MI300A GPUs. Most of them support both air cooling and DLC cooling. As Supermicro is transitioning to our next generation of X14 and H14 product lines featuring the industry's broadest SKUs of Intel XEON 6 processor-based and AMD Turin-based platforms, we are fully ready for high volume production and offer early online access for testing and validation through our JumpStart cloud service.\n\nMeanwhile, our X14 and H14 storage solutions are addressing the specific requirements of accelerated AI data pipelines with partners like Weka, VAST Data, and many others. The rapid growth of our business is raising the complexity to scale our capacity. Our production team are making aggressive progress on retrofitting the new Silicon Valley facilities and scaling up our Taiwan and Malaysia factories. We have secured the parts and acquired additional warehouses for our next phase of enterprise and data center businesses. We are currently on track to produce over 2,000 liquid cooling DLC racks per month of AI servers with volumes steadily increasing. Each DLC rack supports up to 100 kilowatt or even 120 kilowatt. At this moment, we are focusing on delivering more than 1,000 racks of NVIDIA HGX AI supercomputers, each rack supports 64 piece H100, H200 or B200 GPUs, with the latest DLC liquid cooling technology to three industry-leading customers, from April to June of this quarter. A team of technicians in a server room, testing and managing the newest server solutions.\n\nThese three deployments will be among the world's largest DLC liquid-cooled AI clouds, potentially saving our customers up to 40% of energy costs compared to standard air-cooled deployments by our competition. Special thank you to NVIDIA and our close technology partners for this fantastic collaboration. I believe this is just the beginning of our long-term high volume DLC liquid cooling mission. Green Computing can be free with a big bonus. Let's go for Green! In summary, we had a strong quarter with more to come. Supermicro is uniquely capable of delivering new technologies to market faster with our integrated rack-scale plug-and-play solutions, in-house engineering, building block architecture, and green computing DNA. With a robust pipeline of new products in calendar year 2024, we're confident fiscal Q4 revenue will be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion.\n\nThis will raise our fiscal revenue guidance to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, an increase to our recent fiscal 2024 guide. We continue to win market share and remain committed to executing our growth plans across all verticals. This remains truly the most exciting time yet for Supermicro, and I believe this strong year-over-year growth will continue in our fiscal 2025, especially with our new, leading and ready-to-ship DLC liquid cooling rack-scale plug-and-play solutions and technologies. Before passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to thank you again to our partners, our customers, our employees, and our shareholders for your strong support. David?\n\nDavid Weigand: Thank you, Charles. Fiscal Q3 2024 revenues were $3.85 billion, up 200% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Q3 growth was again led by AI GPU platforms which represented more than 50% of revenues with AI GPU customers in both the enterprise and cloud service provider markets. We expect strong growth in Q4 as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins. During Q3, we recorded $1.88 billion in the enterprise/channel vertical, representing 49% of revenues versus 40% last quarter, up 190% year-over-year and 26% quarter-over-quarter, driven by industry recognition of our solution price-performance metrics and reliability. The OEM appliance and large data center vertical revenues were $1.94 billion, representing 50% of Q3 revenues versus 59% in the last quarter, up 222% year-over-year and down 10% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nOne existing CSP/large data center customer represented 21% of Q3 revenues and one existing enterprise/channel customer represented 17% of revenues. Emerging 5G/Telco/Edge/IoT revenues were $37 million or 1% of Q3 revenues. Server and Storage Systems comprised 96% of Q3 revenue and Subsystems and Accessories represented 4%. ASPs increased on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. By geography, U.S. represented 70% of Q3 revenues, Asia 20%, Europe 7%, and Rest of World 3%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 242%, Asia increased 257%, Europe increased 30%, and Rest of World increased 87%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 3%, Asia increased 17%, Europe increased 3%, and Rest of World decreased 11%.\n\nThe Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 15.6%, up slightly quarter-over-quarter from 15.5% as we continued to focus on winning strategic new designs, gaining market share and improving manufacturing efficiencies. Q3 operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased by 14% quarter-over-quarter and 72% year-over-year to $219 million driven by higher compensation expenses and headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 8% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-over-year to $166 million. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3%, which was in-line with Q2 levels. Other income and expense for Q3 was $3.8 million, consisting of $6 million in interest expense and a gain of $10 million principally from foreign exchange. Interest expenses decreased sequentially as we paid down short-term bank credit facilities.\n\nThe GAAP tax rate was negative 5.2% resulting in a tax benefit of $20 million for Q3. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 6% resulting in Q3 tax expense of $27 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were lower due to the impact of higher R&D tax credits and tax benefits from employee stock grants exercised. Q3 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.56 and Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.65 exceeded the high end of guidance through record revenues, stable gross margins and operating margins and lower tax rates. The GAAP share count increased from 58.1 million to 61.4 million and the non-GAAP share count increased sequentially from 59 million to 62 million shares as a result of the two stock offerings and, to a lesser extent, the convertible bond offering. Cash flow used in operations for Q3 was $1.5 billion compared to cash flow usage of $595 million during the previous quarter as we grew inventory and accounts receivable for higher levels of business.\n\nCash flows from strong profitability was offset by higher inventory, a large portion of which was received late in Q3, and higher accounts receivable from increasing revenues. Our Q3 closing inventory was $4.1 billion, which increased by 67% quarter-over-quarter from $2.5 billion in Q2 due to the purchase of key components. Capex was $93 million for Q3 resulting in negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion for the quarter. During the quarter, we raised $1.55 billion from a 0% coupon five-year convertible bond offering due in 2029, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We also raised approximately $1.73 billion in net proceeds from the sale of 2 million shares at a price of $875 per share. The proceeds from these transactions will be used to strengthen our working capital, enable continued investments in R&D and expand global capacity to fulfill strong demand for our leading platforms.\n\nThe closing balance sheet cash position was $2.1 billion, while bank and convertible note debt was $1.9 billion resulting in a net cash position of $252 million versus a net cash position of $350 million last quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter, the Q3 cash conversion cycle was 96 days versus 61 days in Q2. Days of inventory increased by 25 days to 92 days compared to the prior quarter of 67 days due to key component purchases for higher expected Q4 revenues. Days sales outstanding increased by 8 days quarter-over-quarter to 37 days while Days Payables Outstanding decreased by two days to 33 days. Now turning to the outlook for Q4, we expect strong growth as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we expect net sales in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.20 to $8.05 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.62 to $8.42. We expect gross margins to be down sequentially as we focus on driving strategic market share gains. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $226 million and include $55 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q4 of fiscal year 2024 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $30 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $28 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share.\n\nWe expect other income and expenses, including interest expense, to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The company's projections for Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of minus 2.9%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 2.6%, and a fully diluted share count of 64.8 million for GAAP and 65.3 million shares for non-GAAP. We expect CapEx for Q4 to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. For fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion to a range of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, and establishing guidance for GAAP net income per diluted share of $21.61 to $22.46, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $23.29 to $24.09.\n\nOur projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share assume a tax rate of approximately 3.6% and 9.2%, respectively, and a fully diluted share count of 61.2 million shares for GAAP and fully diluted share count of 61.8 million shares for non-GAAP.

        "title": "Stock Market Crash Alert: 3 Must-Buy Semiconductor Stocks When Prices Plunge",
        "content": "Expectations are high when it comes to semiconductor stocks. Maybe too high. Several leading microchip and semiconductor stocks have taken big hits recently after they posted first-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street expectations but still managed to disappoint investors who have come to anticipate meteoric growth from the sector. Fueled by demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, semiconductor stocks have been red hot over the last 18 months. Now it seems that a cooldown period is taking place. This makes it a great time to go after these must-buy semiconductor stocks.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) declined nearly 10% in April after running up 75% during 2023. Much of the growth has been led by semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) which currently produces about three-quarters of the world\u2019s AI chips. Other names also joined the rally and rose at lightning fast speed over the past year. The decline seems to be more about investor expectations than any serious problems at the semiconductor companies. As such, investors would be smart to buy the dip.\n\nHere is stock market crash alert: three must-buy semiconductor stocks when prices plunge.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the day of this writing, the stock of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is down as much as 18% after the company delivered financial results that did not live-up to very high expectations. In fact, SMCI stock is falling largely because the company missed its revenue target, announcing sales of $3.85 billion when Wall Street was looking for $3.95 billion. However, despite the miss, Super Micro Computer\u2019s revenue was up 200% in Q1 from a year earlier.\n\nFor all of this year, the company is forecasting revenue growth of nearly 600%. Yet the huge growth doesn\u2019t seem to be enough to satisfy investors who had sent SMCI stock up more than 700% in the last 12 months. The maker of high-efficiency servers that run AI chips and semiconductors did beat profit forecasts, announcing earnings per share (EPS) of $6.65 compared to $5.78 that was expected among analysts. The post-earnings selloff seems like an overreaction and presents a buying opportunity.\n\nThis is especially true as the growth story related to Super Micro Computer remains intact. Even with the current pullback, SMCI stock is still up more than 150% year to date.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere\u2019s also an opportunity with semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) after its stock fell 10% immediately following a Q1 print that left analysts and investors wanting more. AMD\u2019s earnings and revenue beat forecasts and the company raised its guidance for AI microchip sales this year to $4 billion from $3.5 billion previously. However, the results weren\u2019t enough for Wall Street and the stock is down double digits.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should pounce on the opportunity to buy AMD stock amid the selloff. Like Super Micro Computer, Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 long-term growth story remains solid. As part of its Q1 results, AMD said that revenue at its Data Center unit grew 80% year over year to $2.3 billion due to strong sales of its latest MI300 series AI microchips. The company has sold more than $1 billion of the AI chips since they launched late in 2023. On an earnings call, management said the company is now working on new, more powerful AI chips.\n\nAMD stock is up 400% over the last five years, including a 60% gain in the last 12 months.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has been on an upswing. Since bottoming last Halloween, the legacy semiconductor company\u2019s stock has risen 25%. It\u2019s a big reversal for TXN stock, which has long been a laggard among chipmakers. Texas Instruments got a further boost after the company issued better-than-expected financial results for this year\u2019s first quarter, sending its share price up 7% in a day. Texas Instruments reported earnings per share $1.20, which topped Wall Street forecasts of $1.07.\n\nRevenue during the first three months of the year totaled $3.66 billion, ahead of analyst estimates of $3.60 billion. Looking forward, Texas Instruments said it expects Q2 revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion and profits of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. The company\u2019s Q2 guidance aligned with Wall Street forecasts. Texas Instruments mostly makes chips and semiconductors for use in the automotive sector and industrial applications, areas that are starting to gain traction. Investors should look for a pullback and buy TXN stock.

With us today, Charles Liang, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Weigand, CFO; and Michael Staiger, Vice President of Corporate Development. (Operator Instructions)\r\nThank you.\n\nMichael Thomas Staiger\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for attending Supermicro's call to discuss financial results for the third quarter, which ended March 31, 2024. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. \r\nAs a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the investor -- excuse me, under the Events and Presentations tab. We have published management's scripted commentary on our website. \r\nPlease note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses and other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and the full fiscal year 2024. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations.\r\nYou can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal '23 and our other SEC filings. All these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. \r\nMost of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. \r\nI'll now turn the call over to Charles.\n\nStory continues\n\nCharles Liang\n\nThank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We achieved another record-breaking quarter with revenues of $3.85 billion, a 200% increase from same time last year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.65, up 308% year-on-year. Supermicro is at the forefront of the current AI revolution. These strong results reflect the continued demand for our rack-scale plug and play total ai solutions. \r\nWe continue to face some supply chain challenges due to newer products that require new key components, especially, specifically, DLC related components, and believe this situation will gradually improve in the coming quarters. To sustain this rapid growth, we are making significant investments in production, operations, management software, cloud features and customer service to further increase our customer base and bring more value to them.\r\nTo support this scale-up, we'd raised an additional $3.28 billion through a convertible note and secondary equity offering in the quarter. We like to support strong short and long-term growth with minimal equity dilution. Overall, I remain optimistic that AI growth will continue for many quarters, if not many years to come. \r\nWe have long recognized that AI is accelerating the need for liquid cooling, and we have invested heavily into high quality, optimized direct liquid cooling, DLC solutions for high-end CSPs and NCPs. With GPUs reaching 700 watts and soon more than 1000 watts, efficiently managing the heat from these AI systems has become critical for many customers, especially at the new datacenters. \r\nI am pleased to announce that our new DLC, direct liquid cooling building blocks and rack scale total solution technology are finally floor-ready grade for high volume production. With our DLC, liquid cooling technology, customers can reduce their expense on cooling expense, saving data center space, and allocate a greater portion of their finite power resources to computing instead of cooling, which aligns with our green computing DNA-ware. \r\nNow let's go over some key financial highlights. Supermicro is pleased to be included in the prestigious S&P 500 Index last quarter. Fiscal Q3 net revenue totaled $3.85 billion, up 200% year-on-year, within our aggressive original guidance of March quarter. If not limited by some key component shortages, we could have delivered more. \r\nFiscal Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $6.65 per share were well above $1.63 last year, which was about 308% year-on-year growth. Our increasing economies of scale contributed to better net profit. Our year-over-year operating margin and net income both continue to improve, and we continue to expect further benefits as we bring our Malaysia facility online later this calendar year.\r\nThis fast-growing quarter was driven by end users wanting to accelerate their deployment of the latest generation AI platforms. Through our Building Block Solutions, we provide optimized AI solutions at scale, offering a time-to-market advantage and shorter lead time over our competition. Additionally, our rack-scale plug and play total solutions, especially with liquid cooling DLC, ensure optimal system performance while saving energy cost up to 40% at a data center scale, delivering much more value to customers. \r\nWe are leading the AI revolution by deploying NVIDIA HGX H100 SuperCluster solutions to our customers, housed in our new 100K watt racks, with 2 to 3x higher power density than traditional racks from others. At NVIDIA GTC last month, we unveiled our next-gen Blackwell products, including the GB200 NVL72 solution. To further grow our AI portfolio, we are now strongly focused on delivering new generative AI and inferencing optimized systems based on the upcoming next generation NVIDIA H200, B100, B200, GH200 and GB200 GPUs as well as Intel Gaudi2, Gaudi3 and AMD MI300X and MI300A GPUs. \r\nMost of them support both air cooling and DLC cooling. As Supermicro is transitioning to our next generation of X14/H14 product lines featuring the industry's broadest SKUs of Intel Xeon 6 processor-based and AMD Turin-based platforms, we are fully ready for high volume production and offer early online access for testing and validation through our JumpStart cloud service. \r\nMeanwhile, our X14 and H14 storage solutions are addressing the specific requirements of accelerated AI data pipelines with partners like Weka and VAST Data and many others. The rapid growth of our business is raising the complexity to scale our capacity. Our production teams are making aggressive progress on retrofitting the new Silicon Valley facilities and scaling up our Taiwan and Malaysia factories. We have secured the parts and acquired additional warehouses for our next phase of enterprise and data center businesses. \r\nWe are currently on track to produce over 2,000 liquid cooling DLC racks per month of AI servers with volumes steadily increasing. Each DLC rack supports up to 100k watt or even 120k watt. At this moment, we are focusing on delivering more than 1,000 racks of NVIDIA HGX AI supercomputers. Each rack supports 64 pieces H100, H200 or B200 GPUs with the latest DLC, liquid cooling technology to 3 industry-leading customers, from April to June of this quarter. \r\nThese 3 deployments will be among the world's largest DLC liquid-cooled AI clouds, potentially saving our customers up to 40% of energy costs compared to standard air-cooled deployments by our competition. Special thank you to NVIDIA and our close technology partners for this fantastic collaboration. I believe this is just the beginning of our long-term high-volume DLC liquid cooling mission. Green Computing can be free with a big bonus. Let's go for green.\r\nIn summary, we had a strong quarter with more to come. Supermicro is uniquely capable of delivering new technologies to market faster with our integrated rack-scale plug and play solutions, in-house engineering, building block architecture, and green computing DNA. With a robust pipeline of new products in calendar year 2024, we're confident fiscal Q4 revenue will be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion. This will raise our fiscal revenue guidance to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, an increase to our recent fiscal 2024 guide. \r\nWe continue to win market share and remain committed to executing our growth plans across all verticals. This remains truly the most exciting time yet for Supermicro, and I believe this strong year-over-year growth will continue in our fiscal 2025, especially with our new, leading and ready-to-ship DLC liquid cooling rack scale plug and play solutions and technologies. \r\nBefore passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to thank you again, to our partners, our customers, our employees, and our shareholders for their strong support. David.\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nThank you, Charles. Fiscal Q3 2024 revenues were $3.85 billion, up 200% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Q3 growth was again led by AI GPU platforms, which represented more than 50% of revenues with AI GPU customers in both the enterprise and cloud service provider markets. We expect strong growth in Q4 as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins.\r\nDuring Q3, we recorded $1.88 billion in the enterprise channel vertical, representing 49% of revenues versus 40% last quarter, up 190% year-over-year and 26% quarter-over-quarter, driven by industry recognition of our solution price performance metrics and reliability. The OEM appliance and large data center vertical revenues were $1.94 billion, representing 50% of Q3 revenues versus 59% in the last quarter, up 222% year-over-year and down 10% quarter-over-quarter. \r\nOne existing CSP large data center customer represented 21% of Q3 revenues and one existing enterprise channel customer represented 17% of revenues. Emerging 5G telco/Edge/IoT revenues were $37 million or 1% of Q3 revenues. Server and storage systems comprised 96% of Q3 revenue and subsystems and accessories represented 4%. ASPs increased on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. \r\nBy geography, U.S. represented 70% of Q3 revenues; Asia, 20%; Europe, 7%; and Rest of World, 3%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 242%; Asia increased 257%; Europe increased 30%; and the Rest of the World increased 87%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 3%; Asia increased 17%; Europe increased 3%; and the Rest of the World decreased 11%. \r\nThe Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 15.6%, up slightly quarter-over-quarter from 15.5%, as we continue to focus on winning strategic new designs, gaining market share and improving manufacturing efficiencies. Q3 operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased by 14% quarter-over-quarter and 72% year-over-year to $219 million, driven by higher compensation expenses and head count. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 8% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-over-year to $166 million.\r\nQ3 non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3%, which was in line with Q2 levels. Other income and expense for Q3 was $3.8 million, consisting of $6 million in interest expense and a gain of $10 million, principally from foreign exchange. Interest expenses decreased sequentially as we paid down short-term bank credit facilities.\r\nThe GAAP tax rate was negative 5.2%, resulting in a tax benefit of $20 million for Q3. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 6%, resulting in Q3 tax expense of $27 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were lower due to the impact of higher R&D tax credits and tax benefits from employee stock grants exercised. Q3 GAAP EPS -- diluted EPS of $6.56 and Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.65 exceeded the high end of guidance through record revenues, stable gross margins and operating margins and lower tax rates. \r\nThe GAAP share count increased from 58.1 million to 61.4 million and the non-GAAP share count increased sequentially from 59 million to 62 million shares as a result of the 2 stock offerings and, to a lesser extent, the convertible bond offering. Cash flow used in operations for Q3 was $1.5 billion compared to cash flow usage of $595 million during the previous quarter, as we grew inventory and accounts receivable for higher levels of business. Cash flows from strong profitability was offset by higher inventory, a large portion of which was received late in Q3 and higher accounts receivable from increasing revenues. \r\nOur Q3 closing inventory was $4.1 billion, which increased by 67% quarter-over-quarter from $2.5 billion in Q2 due to the purchase of key components. CapEx was $93 million for Q3, resulting in negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion for the quarter. During the quarter, we raised $1.55 billion from a 0 coupon 5-year convertible bond offering due in 2029, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. \r\nWe also raised approximately $1.73 billion in net proceeds from the sale of 2 million shares at a price of $875 per share. The proceeds from these transactions will be used to strengthen our working capital, enable continued investments in R&D and expand global capacity to fulfill strong demand for our leading platforms. The closing balance sheet position was $2.1 billion, while bank and convertible note debt was $1.9 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $252 million versus a net cash position of $350 million last quarter. \r\nTurning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter. The Q3 conversion cycle was 96 days versus 61 days in Q2. Days of inventory increased by 25 days to 92 days compared to the prior quarter of 67 days due to key component purchases for higher expected Q4 revenues. Days sales outstanding increased by 8 days quarter-over-quarter to 37 days, while days payables outstanding decreased by 2 days to 33 days.\r\nNow turning to the outlook for Q4. We expect strong growth as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we expect net sales in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.20 to $8.05 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.62 to $8.42. We expect gross margins to be down sequentially as we focus on driving strategic market share gains. \r\nGAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $226 million and include $55 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q4 of fiscal year 2024 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $30 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $28 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. \r\nWe expect other income and expenses, including interest expense to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The company's projections for Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of minus 2.9%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 2.6% and a fully diluted share count of 64.8 million for GAAP and 65.3 million shares for non-GAAP.\r\nWe expect CapEx for Q4 to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. For fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion to a range of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion and establishing guidance for GAAP net income per diluted share of $21.61 to $22.46 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $23.29 to $24.09. \r\nOur projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share assume a tax rate of approximately 3.6% and 9.2%, respectively, and a fully diluted share count of 61.2 million shares for GAAP and fully diluted share count of 61.8 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share includes approximately $116 million in expected stock-based compensation net of related tax effects of $98 million that are excluded from non-GAAP net income per diluted share. \r\nWe're now ready for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.\n\nRuplu Bhattacharya\n\nCongrats on the strong guidance. I have 2 questions. First, I wanted to ask a question on liquid cooling. Do you design most of the components for liquid cooling racks in-house? And as such, do you think you would be able to charge more for liquid-cooled racks? And can this be accretive to gross margins?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes, a very good question. Yes, we design lots of key components for DLC liquid cooling system because we care quality, maintenance and also time to market. So we design a lot of key components where we leverage third-party components as well, so it's a combination. And yes, I mean, liquid cooling, we try to charge the customer with minimal premium and customers can save kind of air condition, equipment cost because cooled down by liquid, right?\r\nSo at the same time, customer will save lots of TCO, up to 40% of energy costs. That's why we try to promote a slogan, green computing can be free. We speak bonus. Customers pay a very minimal premium, but they save up to 40% of energy costs. So I believe a lot of customers will go for that direction. And indeed, we already have a handful of customers have a big order, and that's why this quarter alone -- I mean June quarter, we are preparing more than 1,000 liquid cooling racks for those early birds. And I believe that demand will continue growing very strong.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) The next question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nI guess in the press release, Charles, you mentioned the visibility into share gains as the new solutions ramp. And I was curious if you can sort of give us a bit more color there in terms of when you're thinking about share gains, are these related to next-generation GB200 product with NVIDIA? And is this more in relation to sort of hyperscalers? Are you expanding the number of hyperscalers that you're engaged with as you move to these new solutions? Just any more color in terms of the visibility around the share gains. Where is that coming from? And is that more in relation to the next product generation from NVIDIA?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nOkay. Thank you. I mean, yes, we continue to gain market share, especially our rack-scale plug and play solution that reduce customers' lead time and also reduce customers' time-to-online. With our rack-scale plug and program play, a customer, able to put the system, deploy the system online in the next day or next few days instead of the next few weeks. So time-to-online savings is a big advantage to customers. \r\nAt the same time, the deep cooling, they help customer save energy power. So customer can allocate, relocate the energy power to power more computing equipment instead of waste of power for air cool. So saving money, that benefits a lot of leading customers and also rack-scale plug and play that make customer time-to-online. So we continue to gain more new customers while our old customers continue to grow, start to grow faster with our beta offering. So GP200, same thing, right? GP200, each rack will be around be 100k watt. So a lot of customers like that, and we help them build their liquid cooling system and optimize their data center for liquid cooling. So we are growing customer base strongly now.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nI wanted to ask about gross margins. Strong gross margins for the quarter. I know you're guiding to a sequential decline in gross margins. If our math is right, I think that implies 13.5% to 14% gross margins for the June quarter -- sorry, for the June quarter. Is that the right way to think about gross margins on a go-forward basis? Do you still feel comfortable with the prior 14% to 17% long-term gross margins? And any comments just around AI server gross margins in general? And if there are any ancillary services and support that can help improve the margin on just the product sales?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. So our target is still 14% to 17%. If you look at our guide for Q2 -- I'm sorry, for Q3, we actually guided slightly down and we ended up slightly up. And so it's very hard to guide exactly on the margins. There is a range. And in fact, I think the guide inside of the -- inside the models, last time, was even more conservative. So I would say we build conservatively and then seek to overachieve. So I think if you look at our guide for revenue and for OpEx, you'll be able to determine our guide there. But our target is definitely to stay in the 14% to 17% range.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\n\nYes. I'll try and slip in 2 here, if I can. So I guess one of the just kind of housekeeping questions is a very significant increase in inventory this quarter. I know you said that it came in towards the end of the quarter. How do we think about the trajectory of inventory as the supply comes on? Do you expect inventory to stay at this level? Do you expect it to start to come down? I'm just kind of curious how we think that flow through kind of looks as you take on more supply. And then just a quick housekeeping thing, too, is that the 21% customer you referenced in the prepared remarks, is that the same customer, large customer you had last quarter? Or how has that evolved?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nTwo reasons we had to increase inventory: One is because Q4, I mean, June quarter, we will have a strong revenue growth; a second reason because we're preparing for high-volume liquid cooling. Again, we have more than 1,000 of 100k watt, I mean, liquid cooling rack we have to ship to customers in Q4. And liquid cooling as you know, is pretty new. So we had to prepare enough inventory so that we can deliver liquid cooling rack scale product to customer on time or with minimal lead time. So both factor, indeed, is a positive factor. And with our economic scale continuing to grow, indeed, our inventory average [daily], indeed, will slightly improve.\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. So Aaron, my take on that is I hope that our inventory continues to grow because that means there's a reason behind it, so -- and it's tied to sales. So to your second question, the 21% customer was the same as last quarter. And I wanted to let you know that in the Q, we're going to be moving to a customer A, customer B, customer C because as we add more customers, we'll try to make it easier to make those distinguishments.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of George Wang with Barclays.\n\nDong Wang\n\nCongrats on the strong June guide. I'd like to put it in 2 parts quickly, just -- not asking for a specific guidance for FY '25 or the September, December quarter. But any sort of high-level kind of color you can provide just to think about how to model the September, December and also the FY '25. And also kind of related, kind of, can you pass out kind of utilization in the March quarter? And also kind of what's the expected utilization kind of cadence for the next few quarters?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes. As you know, we have a lot of new product coming soon, right, to support the NVIDIA H200, B100, B200, GP200 and AMD MI300 and Intel Gaudi2, Gaudi3. So we have a lot of new product already and plus liquid cooling DLC, we are ready to ship high-volume product. So for sure, I mean, candidate -- I mean fiscal year '25, I mean, for September, December quarter, we will have strong growth. And I believe this strong growth will continue for many quarters to come, if not many years. I believe it will be many years.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.\n\nAnanda Prosad Baruah\n\nYes. Really, really appreciate it. And Charles, let me -- maybe to the remarks you made a moment ago about the strong ongoing growth, does that -- could that mean that you could also grow sequentially from this point forward for a little bit, just given the market share gain opportunities, the components coming online that you talked about in the new products? Any context on way to think about sequential growth sort of in the coming quarters would be helpful as well.\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes. As you know, traditionally, in the last 10 years, right, I mean, the September quarter and March quarter, always our soft quarter. But now with AI, we've been growing so strong. So we basically are able to grow sequentially. So although March and September be a little weak, but basically, because of strong AI growth and our market share growing, so the sequential growth will become the normal. And basically, I mean, we have even better technologies than before ever, and now economic scale become much bigger. Malaysia campus production will be ready by end of this calendar year, so we see a lot of positive factors to grow our business.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities.\n\nJonathan E. Tanwanteng\n\nI was wondering if you could talk a little bit more to the gross margins. And if you expect them to go structurally higher at some point in the near future, in the coming quarters, especially if Malaysia ramps, you get economies of scale there as you transition to do products and you add more liquid cooling. Is there a point where that starts to revert higher? Or do you expect it to remain at a relatively constant level for the foreseeable future?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nAgain, the AI reform is getting popular, right? So they are more and more competitive as well. So we will try to keep a balance. To grow market, we may -- sometimes, some deal, we may have to be a little bit more aggressive in pricing. But overall, we try to keep a balance. David, you may add some here.\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. And also I agree with your point that Malaysia will also offer some opportunity to us. And we're also at a transition time when there's a lot of new -- we have a lot of new platforms that are coming out and the customers are highly anticipating. And those platforms are built on some emerging technologies that -- from many different areas. And we -- Supermicro's strength, again, is its fast time to market. And we expect with these -- with the emerging technologies and our new platforms and our liquid cooling to be first out there with very compelling solutions. So we think those things are all going to be helping our margins.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\n\nMehdi Hosseini\n\nYes. A couple for me. Regarding the channel customer, the 17% of the customer, have you ever had a channel customer that big? I believe in the past, you've talked about a 21%-, 20%-plus customer, but I think this is new. Can you clarify this?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nSo this is an existing customer, and we actually had a higher customer back in 2022, Mehdi, but I think they were around 22%. But this is still a really good customer, a really good opportunity.\n\nMehdi Hosseini\n\nOkay. Great. And then 1 question for you, David, on the cash flow. Actually, there is -- I believe there are 2 items. There is $110 million of cash burn in operation and then there was also a noncurrent asset. Am I missing something here? These 2 items were big items that had an impact to our overall cash flow, is that correct?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nSure. We had a number of things that impacted this. I think in noncurrent assets, we had -- deferred taxes grew by quite a bit this year -- or this quarter, and so that was something unusual. And then -- see, I think those are -- I think that's the only unusual item was the deferred taxes grew a lot, and that's what lowered our tax rate, our quarterly tax rate as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital.\n\nNehal Sushil Chokshi\n\nCongrats on a strong guide here. Talk about the guide here. Inventory increased $1.5 billion Q-over-Q. And Dave, as you mentioned, you'd like to see inventory increase. I do too because it's a strong indicator of things to come. And you guided June quarter to increase by $1.6 billion Q-over-Q. If I do this math, where I'm looking at the inventory at the quarter end and then the [fourth] quarter revenue, typically, it's around 60% to 70% of revenue. But with your March Q ending inventory and your current [June, too,] guidance, that equates to about 85% of projected revenue. So can you just explain what seems to be a little bit more usual inventory buildup given the revenue guidance range?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nSure. Absolutely. That's a fair question. So we actually got a substantial amount of inventory in the last week of the quarter, okay, which obviously, we're not going to be able to ship, but we took in $700 million in the last week of the quarter. So that's not something -- that's something that has to do with when inventory arrives. And so we -- it hurts our cash flow, but you know what, it doesn't matter, because we need that inventory for Q4 shipments.\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes. Again, 2 reasons, right? Q4, we will have a strong revenue, so we had to prepare for Q4. And also, I mean, liquid cooling, I mean, it's new. So we had to prepare enough safety inventory for liquid cooling demand for June quarter and September quarter as well. So that's another reason why we have a slightly higher inventory now.\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. And I want to add, Nehal, that, that's exactly why we did capital raises, too, is to prepare for these Q4 shipments, and -- so that we could make those large purchases, and we hope to continue that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Matt Bryson with Wedbush.\n\nMatthew Stevens Bryson\n\nI would be thinking with liquid cooling ramping in fiscal Q4, not to harp on the gross margin issue, but that you would be seeing a benefit to gross margins? And I guess my question is, is there any chance that other with the liquid cooling solutions or with your other solutions, that you're again seeing some penetration at those larger customers and specifically hyperscalers, and that's why we're seeing gross margins come down? And I guess just 1 clarification for Dave. If you can provide the magnitude that revenues were affected by your inability to procure components in fiscal Q3?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nLet me add a little bit. Because liquid cooling is new to us, so to speed up quick support for some of our very important customer on June quarter, indeed, we had to pay some premium to speed up the supply. So we spend a bunch of effort there. David, you may add?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. So the 2 questions, Matt, I would say, first of all, to the gross margin question, again, I tried to give a -- my philosophy is give a conservative guide and then work to exceed that and we were able to do that in Q3, and we'll do everything we can do it -- can do to beat it in Q4. But it'll depend also on what we ship. \r\nAs to the magnitude of revenue, I'll go back to the fact that our backlog is at a record high. And so what that means is that every quarter, we could have shipped more if we had more parts. And so therefore, it's an ongoing problem. And we don't rely on that as an excuse. The fact of the matter is we're glad to be able to produce the products that we're producing for some of the best companies in the world. And so we continue -- we will continue to do that. And we're very upbeat by the fact that the supply chain continues to improve each quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is a follow-up from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities.\n\nJonathan E. Tanwanteng\n\nI was wondering if you could speak to your cash usage expectations over the next quarter or 2. Are the proceeds from your recent capital raise is all spoken for as you look to the growth in the pipeline and the record backlog you spoke to? Or do you think that's more in reserve for growth further down the line?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. So the way I would answer that is, is that I hope that I have -- I need more capital, Jon, because that means that we're booking -- that we're growing revenues even faster. So we've got capital adequate to get us through the current market, which means today. But in a week, that -- we hope that, that changes, and we hope that we've got orders that require even more capital. So all I can say is I hope that -- I'm hoping for the need for more capital.\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes. We believe our revenue will continue to grow strong. And that's why we need more capital to grow faster. If we grow 20%, 30%, we may have enough capital now, but it will grow much faster. Then for sure, we need more capital to grow stronger.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question today is a follow-up from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital.\n\nNehal Sushil Chokshi\n\nThis is for Charles. Charles, with the capital base that you have now, and I hear you, David, that you hope that you will need more capital. But with the capital base that you have now, technology advantage that you've always had that you've added to, is there anything else that you need in order to become the #1 vendor?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes. Indeed, our brand is very ambitious. Let me use that word. We have a very ambitious brand. So we try to continue to grow very strong, kind of 3x to 5x faster than the industry's average. So when that case happen, and we believe so, we hope so, then for sure, we need more capital.\r\nThank you. Thank you. See you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. Have an excellent rest of your day.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI Hardware Stocks Get Pummeled Even as Big Tech Keeps Spending",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The good news for makers of semiconductors and other artificial intelligence computing hardware: tech giants plan to keep spending heavily. The bad news is that investors are harder to impress this earnings season.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market NYC Police Break Up Columbia Protest and Clashes Erupt at UCLA Lilly Soars as Forecast Boost Shows Weight-Loss Drugs\u2019 Power Amazon Posts Strongest Cloud Sales Growth in a Year on AI Demand Pot Stocks Surge on Report DEA Set to Reclassify Marijuana\n\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Super Micro Computer Inc. have sold off despite projections of rising sales from buyers of equipment used in data centers.\n\nAMD fell 6.7% in premarket trading after a raised revenue forecast for accelerator chips didn\u2019t win over investors. Super Micro, which makes servers, slumped 13% despite quarterly projections that beat estimates.\n\nSuch declines aren\u2019t overreactions, according to Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. \u201cIt is warranted at this point. They are meeting the FY24 estimates but nothing more than that.\u201d\n\nHardware makers have seen their shares rally this year amid an arms race for AI computing power that\u2019s lifting sales and profits. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index was up 12% through Tuesday, led by Nvidia Corp. with a 74% gain. Super Micro Computer had more than tripled.\n\nThe gains have raised expectations \u2014 as well as concerns that the stocks may have gotten ahead of themselves in the short term. That was evident on April 19 when Nvidia and other AI winners tumbled out of the blue ahead of Big Tech earnings reports.\n\n\u201cValuations in this space are clearly being driven by multiple years of earnings growth and that always embodies a higher degree of uncertainty,\u201d said Joanne Feeney, partner and portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management.\n\nFor AMD, some analysts question how well the firm is placed to deal with \u201cthe threat of own chip production coming from companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Google,\u201d said Garnry.\n\nAs for Super Micro, the stock is \u201cthe talk of the town. However, a long-term quality investor would likely pass on this opportunity as it is questionable how deep their moat really is in the long run. I think the market has pushed expectations too high.\u201d\n\nWhile investors will have to wait several weeks for Nvidia to report on May 22, Qualcomm Inc. earnings are due on Wednesday afternoon. Arm Holdings Plc, which is up 35% this year, reports on May 8.\n\nThe Philadelphia semiconductor index is priced at 26 times projected profits, down from a March peak of about 30 times profits but well above the 10-year average of about 17 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nBulls will point to positive signs of demand. On Tuesday, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud computing unit posted its strongest sales growth in a year, aided by demand for artificial intelligence services. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures would increase \u201cmeaningfully\u201d this year, compared with 2023, primarily to support growth at Amazon Web Services.\n\nLast week, Meta Platforms Inc. raised its forecast for capital spending in 2024 by billions of dollars. Microsoft Corp.\u2019s capital expenditures were $14 billion in the most recent quarter and Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said spending will continue to rise. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s capital expenditures were $12 billion in the first quarter and management expects similar spending for the remainder of the year.\n\nStill, beyond high investor expectations lies another major issue at play, with 10-year Treasury yields currently around the highest levels since November.\n\n\u201cThe higher Treasury yields go, the higher discount rates go and the lower the present value of cash flows and thus the lower the theoretical value of the equity goes,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cEquity investors may be better off looking at the big wood of Treasury yields rather than the trees of quarterly results if they are to discover why the US market equity has just thrown out its worst month since September,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if the quarterly results season has been benign and generally lived up to high expectations.\u201d\n\nTop Tech News\n\nTesla Inc.\u2019s pivotal partnership with Baidu Inc. in China may amount to a U-turn of sorts for Elon Musk, who\u2019s long claimed his company can eventually offer self-driving without high-definition maps. Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, a sign that the retailer\u2019s most profitable unit is recovering from a slump as businesses resume spending on technology projects, including artificial intelligence services. Microsoft Corp.\u2019s motivation for investing heavily and partnering with OpenAI came from a sense of falling badly behind Google, according to an internal email released Tuesday as part of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust case against the search giant. The prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates is weighing on crypto, underlined by deepening Bitcoin losses after the token\u2019s worst monthly drop since the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX empire in November 2022. The internationally recognized government of Yemen is nearing a licensing deal with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to provide satellite internet service to the war-torn country, according to a senior government official.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPremarket\n\nCDW CGI Inc Entegris Flex Avnet Riot Platforms Inc TTM Tech Extreme Networks CTS Postmarket\n\nQualcomm Cognizant Monolithic Power Ansys PTC Inc.

We charge a minimal premium for these systems, but they allow customers to save significantly on energy costs, up to 40%. This approach aligns with our slogan, \"green computing can be free with a bonus,\" as the energy savings effectively offset the costs.\n\nQ: Regarding the visibility into share gains as the new solutions ramp, can you provide more color on where these gains are coming from? Are they related to the next-generation GB200 product with NVIDIA? A: (Charles Liang - CEO) Our market share gains are primarily driven by our rack-scale plug and play solutions, which reduce deployment time and energy costs with efficient cooling. These advantages are appealing to new and existing customers, particularly as we introduce products like the GB200 that support high power densities and advanced cooling solutions.\n\nQ: Can you discuss the expected trajectory of gross margins, particularly with the introduction of new technologies and the ramp-up in Malaysia? A: (David Weigand - CFO) We aim to maintain our gross margin within the 14% to 17% range. The introduction of new platforms and technologies, such as liquid cooling and advanced AI solutions, should support this goal. Additionally, our expansion in Malaysia is expected to contribute to economies of scale and potentially enhance margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ: With the significant increase in inventory this quarter, how should we think about inventory levels moving forward? A: (Charles Liang - CEO) The increase in inventory is strategic, supporting anticipated revenue growth and the specific needs of liquid cooling solutions, which are relatively new and require careful stock management. This approach is expected to continue in the near term to ensure we meet customer demand promptly.\n\nQ: Given the strong revenue guidance and the record backlog, what are your expectations for capital needs moving forward? A: (David Weigand - CFO) Our current capital is sufficient for now, but as we continue to grow and expand, particularly at rates significantly above industry averages, we anticipate the need for additional capital to support this growth.\n\nQ: Can you provide any insights into how the fiscal year 2025 might unfold in terms of growth and product launches? A: (Charles Liang - CEO) We expect strong growth to continue into fiscal year 2025, driven by new product launches and our advanced liquid cooling technologies. These factors, combined with our strategic investments in production capacity and global expansion, particularly in Malaysia, position us well for sustained growth.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) came out with quarterly earnings of $6.65 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.78 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.63 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 15.05%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this server technology company would post earnings of $5.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.59, delivering a surprise of 2.01%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nSuper Micro , which belongs to the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, posted revenues of $3.85 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.89%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.28 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nSuper Micro shares have added about 213.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Super Micro?\n\nWhile Super Micro has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Super Micro: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $7.24 on $4.87 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $22.17 on $14.73 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer- Storage Devices is currently in the top 5% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, NetApp (NTAP), is yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024.\n\nThis data storage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nNetApp's revenues are expected to be $1.66 billion, up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Super Micro Computer Inc. reported quarterly sales that tripled from the same period last year but fell slightly short of estimates, disappointing investors who had sky-high expectations for the server maker\u2019s business to benefit from AI-related demand.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years Binance and CZ\u2019s Fortunes Are Set to Grow, Even in Jail Wall Street Hit by Fed Jitters to Close Wild April: Markets Wrap Tesla Soars on Tentative China Approval for Driving System Stocks Trade for 390 Minutes a Day. Increasingly, Only 10 Matter\n\nRevenue in the fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31, climbed to $3.85 billion, the company said Tuesday in a statement. That\u2019s just below the consensus estimate of $3.86 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was $6.65 per share, ahead of the $5.58 expected by Wall Street analysts.\n\nA jump in demand for the equipment that powers artificial intelligence training and applications has helped drive sales at Super Micro, which makes data center servers. Growth rates at the San Jose, California-based company have climbed higher in recent quarters on the back of deals with large corporations and an improving supply of high-powered chips.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results weren\u2019t enough to advance the hype. The shares dropped about 7% in extended trading after closing at $858.80 in New York. The company has more than tripled in value this year and been added to the S&P 500 Index. Still, the stock had declined about 25% since a peak in March after the company announced a share sale to raise as much as $2 billion.\n\nChief Executive Officer Charles Liang said in the statement that the company should \u201ccontinue gaining market share\u201d as new products are released. A major point of investor caution is whether Nvidia Corp., the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker, will cut into Super Micro\u2019s revenue as the semiconductor giant invests in new business lines, wrote George Wang, an analyst at Barclays, in a note before the results were released.\n\nRevenue in the quarter ending in June will be $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, the company said. Analysts, on average, projected $4.73 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, will be as much as $8.42 per share, compared with an average estimate of $6.97.\n\n(Updates with extended trading in the fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy Tesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes Biden Strategy to Tame Gas Prices Is in Peril as Iran Sanctions Pressure Mounts How the TikTok Law Could Intensify the US-China Tech Spat How to Book a Rocket Ride: Advice From a Space Travel Agent\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Newly listed companies are, by their nature, speculative investments. Beyond the return of IPOs, there are several established stocks that remain volatile and hard to predict, from cryptocurrency miners such as Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) to electric vehicle makerTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nHere are three speculative stocks that could make you a fortune (if you dare).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRubrik (RBRK) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIt just went public and it\u2019s hard to know where the stock is headed, but investors with an appetite for risk might want to consider data software company Rubrik (NYSE:RBRK). The company\u2019s share price rose 16% during its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange following a successful initial public offering (IPO) on April 25. Since then, RBRK stock has fallen 6%. Investors might want to buy the dip in the company, which has the backing of tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others.\n\nRubrik sold 23.5 million shares at a valuation of $5.60 billion. The data management software maker raised $752 million from the IPO. Like most start-ups that go public, Rubrik is unprofitable.\n\nFounded in 2014, the company reported a net loss of $354 million in its latest fiscal year, compared with a $278 million loss the previous year. The company generates 91% of its revenue from subscription fees. Microsoft has been an investor in Rubrik since it was still privately held in 2021.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock continues to lead the benchmark S&P 500 index, having tripled its share price year to date. SMCI stock is up 209% since January, although it has pulled back 15% during the month of April, opening up a potential buying opportunity for investors with nerves of steal. Super Micro Computer\u2019s stock has been on a blistering rally, increasing 740% in the last 12 months alone. The company has grown so quickly that it was recently added to the S&P 500 for the first time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe previous small cap company makes data centers that power artificial intelligence (AI). Super Micro\u2019s market capitalization has soared from $4.50 billion at the end of 2022 to more than $50 billion today.\n\nSMCI stock really took off a year ago after the company announced a partnership with leading microchip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). While the rapid gains are impressive, this stock comes with risks. Super Micro Computer is one of the most shorted stocks, with traders betting the share price will decline.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Reddit logo displayed on a smartphone device. RDDT stock\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nSocial media company Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) held its IPO in late March, and while the share offering was oversubscribed and viewed as a success, the company\u2019s shares have since pulled back about 6% after initially jumping in their market debut. Reddit, which runs online message boards and discussion forums, was one of the most high-profile IPOs of the past few years and the first social media company to go public since Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) in 2019.\n\nLike Rubrik, Reddit is unprofitable. While Reddit\u2019s revenue grew 20% in 2023 to $804 million, the company posted a net loss last year of $90.8 million. Analysts have initiated coverage of RDDT stock with a consensus rating of \u201cmoderate buy.\u201d\n\nThe average price target on the stock is is $49.20, which is about 4% higher than current levels. Achieving profitability and demonstrating continued growth will be key for Reddit when it issues its first earnings print as a public company on May 7.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in MSFT and NVDA.

        "title": "Supermicro Announces Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results",
        "content": "SAN JOSE, Calif., April 30, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Super Micro Computer, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMCI), a Total IT Solution Provider for AI, Cloud, Storage and 5G/Edge, today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2024 ended March 31, 2024.\n\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights\n\nNet sales of $3.85 billion versus $3.66 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and $1.28 billion in the same quarter of last year. Gross margin of 15.5% versus 15.4% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and 17.6% in the same quarter of last year. Net income of $402 million versus $296 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and $86 million in the same quarter of last year. Diluted net income per common share of $6.56 versus $5.10 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and $1.53 in the same quarter of last year. Non-GAAP diluted net income per common share of $6.65 versus $5.59 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and $1.63 in the same quarter of last year. Cash flow used in operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 of $1,520 million and capital expenditures of $93 million.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 15.6% with adjustments for stock-based compensation expenses of $3 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per common share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $6.65, with adjustments for stock-based compensation expenses of $9 million, net of the related tax effect of $47 million.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, total cash and cash equivalents was $2,115 million and total bank debt and convertible notes were $1,863 million.\n\n\"We had yet another record quarter with fiscal Q3 revenue of $3.85 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $6.65 per share. This year-over-year revenue growth of 200% and year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth of 308% was well above our industry peers,\" said Charles Liang, President and CEO of Supermicro. \"Strong demand for AI rack scale PnP solutions, along with our team\u2019s ability to develop innovative DLC designs, enabled us to expand our market leadership in AI infrastructure. As new solutions ramp, including fully production ready DLC, we expect to continue gaining market share. As such, we are raising our fiscal year 2024 revenue outlook from $14.3 to $14.7 billion to a new range of $14.7 to $15.1 billion.\"\n\nBusiness Outlook and Management Commentary\n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, the Company expects net sales of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, GAAP net income per diluted share of $7.20 to $8.05 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $7.62 to $8.42. The Company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share assume a tax rate of approximately -2.9% and 2.6%, respectively, and a fully diluted share count of 64.8 million shares for GAAP and fully diluted share count of 65.3 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share includes approximately $30 million in expected stock-based compensation, net of related tax effects of $28 million that are excluded from non-GAAP net income per diluted share.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, the Company is raising its guidance for revenues from a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion to a range of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion and establishing guidance for GAAP net income per diluted share of $21.61 to $22.46 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $23.29 to $24.09. The Company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share assume a tax rate of approximately 3.6% and 9.2%, respectively, and a fully diluted share count of 61.2 million shares for GAAP and fully diluted share count of 61.8 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share includes approximately $116 million in expected stock-based compensation, net of related tax effects of $98 million that are excluded from non-GAAP net income per diluted share.\n\nConference Call and Webcast Information\n\nSupermicro will present a live audio webcast of a conference call to review its third quarter of fiscal year 2024 on Tuesday, April 30, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. ET / 2:00 p.m. PT.\n\nThe webcast will be available at https://ir.supermicro.com.\n\nA replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call at the same website and will remain accessible for one year.\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\n\nStatements contained in this press release that are not historical fact may be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements may relate to, among other things, the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and updated full year fiscal 2024 guidance, the ability of the team to develop innovative DLC designs, the ability to expand market leadership in AI infrastructure, the ability of new systems to ramp, and the ability to continue to gain market share. Such forward looking statements do not constitute guarantees of future performance and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including: (i) our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could cause rapid declines in our stock price, (ii) as we increasingly target larger customers and larger sales opportunities, our customer base may become more concentrated, our cost of sales may increase, our margins may be lower and our sales may be less predictable, (iii) if we fail to meet publicly announced financial guidance or other expectations about our business, our stock could decline in value, (iv) the average sales prices for our server solutions could decline if customers do not continue to purchase our latest generation products or additional components, and (v) adverse economic conditions may harm our business. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or suggested in any forward looking statements are contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those factors discussed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in such filings, particularly in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed thereafter.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin discussed in this press release adds back stock-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP diluted net income per common share discussed in this press release adds back stock-based compensation expenses and litigation recovery adjusted for the related tax effects. Management presents non-GAAP financial measures because it considers them to be important supplemental measures of performance. Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including analysis of the Company's performance against prior periods, the preparation of operating budgets and to determine appropriate levels of operating and capital investments. Management also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the Company's financial and operational performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP gross margin to non-GAAP gross margin and from GAAP diluted net income per common share to non-GAAP diluted net income per common share is included in the tables below.\n\nAbout Super Micro Computer, Inc.\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ: SMCI) is a global leader in Application-Optimized Total IT Solutions.

        "content": "At one point Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was in official correction territory. Shares were down more than 20% on fears of a slowing artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Not that the fears had any basis in fact. It was only because Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) failed to provide preliminary financial results when announcing its earnings release date that caused the stock to slide.\n\nIt indicated that investors were worried about Nvidia\u2019s valuation. Having come so far so fast, the chipmaker was trading at nosebleed valuations. At such times, any sort of tremor in the marketplace can shake an overvalued stock\u2019s foundation\u2019s.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock has mostly bounced back, up about 13%, it still has a ways to go before reaching a new, all-time high. Also, it means investors might bail on it again at a moment\u2019s notice. You may want to protect your downside by seeking out new AI stocks to grab now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBecause the chipmaker\u2019s stock still carries lofty valuations, consider the three stocks below to make a windfall.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nMost investors know Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a premier chip stock for mobile handsets. But few realize that QCOM is an AI beast. Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip released last year powers the AI capabilities on Android phones like Samsung\u2018s Galaxy S24 series and smartphones from China\u2019s OnePlus and Xiaomi.\n\nAlso, the Snapdragon chip can support dozens of generative AI models. Those include Meta Platform\u2018s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet\u2018s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Gemini. That suggests the chip can also make its way into lower cost phones and introduce the language models into their phones. We know Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to use Gemini in its next iteration of the iPhone.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful Qualcomm can achieve the same market valuation as Nvidia, if for no other reason than the growth trajectories of the various markets they target. However, as AI trickles down throughout technology ecosystems, more and varied uses for Qualcomm\u2019s chips will become apparent. And because QCOM stock offers investors a better stock valuation than its rival, investors will reap a windfall grabbing its shares now.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nData centers are going to be a major component for the next phase of AI growth. Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) should be a prime beneficiary. Hyperscalers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are relying upon data centers for their cloud computing services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Arista Networks makes the servers, routers, switches and network operating software data centers rely upon. The stock took a big hit earlier this month after an analyst said it would face increased competition from Nvidia. Not usually considered a rival, Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of Mellanox several years ago positions it to enter the market.\n\nYet, Arista Networks counts all major hyperscalers as customers, primarily Meta and Microsoft, both seeking ways to become less reliant upon Nvidia. And Meta\u2019s recent earnings proclamation that it plans to spend $35 billion to $40 billion on AI should see a lot of that money fall to Arista Networks.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe last stock investors should consider running off with for windfall profits is ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML). The Netherlands-based manufacturer of specialized chip equipment is a literal monopoly on certain high-end machines needed for producing AI chips.\n\nASML is the world\u2019s only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung are all customers buying the equipment to produce the advanced AI chips customers need. TSM, of course, is the world\u2019s biggest foundry and counts Nvidia as a major customer.\n\nThe equipment manufacturer anticipates demand growing through 2025. And this year will be the first time ever ASML pre-builds its inventory in anticipation of future orders. Having supply on hand will shorten lead time and improve efficiency. If AI is going to grow, it is going to need ASML\u2019s equipment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now That Could Make You a Fortune",
        "content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is widely regarded as one of the most prescient business leaders. From his perch atop the financial services powerhouse, Dimon can see trends develop before most others.\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders published earlier this month, Dimon urged investors to prepare for the coming impact of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhile we do not know the full effect or the precise rate at which AI will change our business -- or how it will affect society at large -- we are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others.\n\nPrudent investors will heed Dimon's warnings and begin to adjust their investment strategies to account for AI's potentially profound effects on the global economy. Here are two stocks you can buy today to position your portfolio to profit from the coming AI revolution.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nThe biggest winners in the AI race will be the companies that help their customers make the most of their ever-growing mounds of data. Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) excels in this increasingly vital domain -- and business is booming.\n\nPalantir built its reputation as a valued partner to the U.S. intelligence community. The CIA reportedly used Palantir's tools during the search for Osama bin Laden.\n\nPalantir continues to provide crucial services to the U.S. government and its allies today. The U.S. Army awarded Palantir a contract valued at $178 million in March to help build next-generation sensors and intelligence-gathering stations. Palantir is also assisting Ukraine with its humanitarian demining operations, as well as its efforts to provide safe access to in-person learning areas for school-age children.\n\nBusinesses are also flocking to Palantir for a chance to reap the tremendous potential benefits of its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). By marrying its proven machine learning technology to the most advanced AI models and real-time data, Palantir says it can help its customers complete certain tasks up to 10 times faster -- and with fewer resources.\n\nThe effects of these stunning productivity gains for its clients are just beginning to show up in Palantir's financial results. The data analytics leader's U.S. commercial revenue soared by 70% year over year to $131 million in the fourth quarter, fueled by a 55% surge in customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet Palantir ended 2023 with only 221 U.S. commercial customers. Investors can expect this figure to continue to grow rapidly in the coming years. Palantir recently forged a new partnership with cloud software giant Oracle. The deal should make it easier for businesses to access Palantir's AI-powered solutions on Oracle's fast-growing cloud computing platform, and the two companies will work together to cross-sell their services.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nThe booming demand for AI software is driving sales of the hardware that powers the groundbreaking technology. Yet while Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) high-performance servers and data storage systems are selling like hotcakes, its shares are currently on sale.\n\nSupermicro (as the company is known) saw its revenue soar by 103% year over year to $3.7 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023. Profit growth was also strong, with net income up 68% to $296 million. The AI hardware maker is gaining market share due in part to its close ties to Nvidia. The torrid demand for the semiconductor titan's AI chips is boosting sales of the related computing equipment Supermicro offers.\n\nYet Supermicro's stock price has retreated from the highs it reached in March. Some investors were apparently miffed that Supermicro didn't preannounce its earnings results for the quarter ended March 31, as it had in some prior quarters. That sparked a steep sell-off in mid-April, and shares are now down roughly 30% from their 52-week highs.\n\nStill, KeyBanc analysts see Supermicro's share of the server market more than doubling in the year ahead as more companies shift to AI-accelerated computing systems. Supermicro's sales and earnings should rise sharply as it claims a larger portion of an AI server industry that could grow more than fourfold to $177 billion by 2032, according to Global Market Insights. Buy shares today, and you could profit alongside this AI infrastructure leader as it works to meet its customers' needs for high-performance computing.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "13 Best Growth Stocks Under $10 to Buy",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best growth stocks under $10 to buy. If you want to skip our overview of growth investing and the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Growth Stocks Under $10 to Buy.\n\nThe AI gold rush on Wall Street has enabled indexes to set new records and allowed companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to reshape the valuation dynamics of the stock market. This surge, which has covered any company that investors believe has exposure to the demand for AI hardware and software, has also shown that growth stocks are the right way to go when considering profits through share price appreciation.\n\nThese stocks are those that are determined by investors to have significant competitive advantages that can ensure that their future earnings are significantly higher than current levels. This optimism is reflected through their share prices, and analysts and investors measure the investor sentiment through the price to earnings ratio. The higher the P/E ratio is compared to the industry benchmark, the more investors believe that the future is bright. At the same time, growth stocks are also among the riskiest in the market.\n\nThis is because the value of a stock is a reflection of the investors' belief in its future. A share price shows what investors expect a company can earn in the future, with these expectations adding to the potential fundamental based valuation that might be baked into the share price. Consequently, since expectations can be fickle, and in today's fast paced news environment news spreads like wildfire, the share price can tank much faster than it took to build the gains.\n\nIn fact, we don't have to sift through many growth stocks to understand this risk. Continuing with our discussion of NVIDIA, the firm's trailing P/E ratio currently sits at 69.09 while the forward P/E ratio is 34.25. The recent growth in its earnings has brought this valuation down to earth, since as recently as in July 2023, NVIDIA's trailing P/E ratio was 243.38. So how does this relate to the risks with growth stocks? Well, in April 2024, another AI stock, the San Jose, California based semiconductor firm Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) failed to release a preliminary earnings report ahead of its earnings for the first quarter of 2024. While it's normal for firms to not post this report, for Super Micro, it was a deviation from historic norms that led analysts to wonder if there was something amiss that the firm was uncertain of declaring before its official results came out.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, the growth expectations that were baked into semiconductor growth AI stocks had to shift. For Super Micro, the aftermath was devastating as the shares tanked by a whopping 23% despite the fact that its P/E ratio has floated around 20 - 25 for most of the past twelve months. For NVIDIA, the firm that had a triple digit P/E ratio the news was just as bad, as, despite no fault of its own, the re calibration of investor expectations that are baked into a growth stock also led to a 10% NVIDIA share price drop.\n\nSince NVIDIA is heading into yet another crucial earnings release, and now with the backdrop of potential trouble at Super Micro, let's see what the hedge funds are saying about this growth stock. Here's one such excerpt from\u00a0Polen Capital's investor letter for the fourth quarter of 2023:\n\nGiven many of NVIDIA\u2019s customers or its end customers are still very much in the experimentation phase with generative AI, it is unclear how sustainable the current demand for GPUs truly is. At the same time, it is known that NVIDIA has historically been highly cyclical. By the end of 2024, we believe NVIDIA will already account for roughly half the market for datacenter chips, servers, and networking equipment, which is unprecedented. Even though the valuation at 25x forward earnings doesn\u2019t look very demanding at first glance, it assumes NVIDIA will own virtually the entire datacenter chip market in just the next few years and will sustain year-on-year growth despite being a cyclical business that is currently experiencing much higher new peaks.\n\nWe believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, but we also believe the long-term growth outcomes are currently too variable, and the expectations built into the company\u2019s $1.2 trillion valuation as of this writing assume the most optimistic of those scenarios.\n\nSo, as the first quarter of 2024 earnings season is shaping to be quite an interesting one indeed, let's take a look at some growth stocks that are trading for under $10. A couple of notable picks are NexGen Energy Ltd. (NYSE:NXE), BGC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGC), and Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (NYSE:AQN). 13 Best Growth Stocks Under $10 to Buy\n\nA money manager at a desk crowded with financial reports and data screens.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best growth stocks under $10, we selected 32 stocks that are under $10, have a P/E ratio greater than 50, and have a market capitalization greater than $300 million.

        "content": "Two trendy artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have led the S&P 500 higher in 2024. When the market closed on April 24, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) had notched year-to-date gains of 61% and 166%, respectively, surpassing every other stock in the index. Even so, certain Wall Street analysts are forecasting substantial gains for shareholders over the next year.\n\nSpecifically, Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt recently raised his price target on Nvidia to $1,400 per share, implying 69% upside from the current price of $826 per share. Similarly, Ananda Baruah at Loop Capital recently raised his price target on Super Micro Computer to $1,500 per share, implying 91% upside from the current price of $787 per share.\n\nInvestors should never fixate on forecasts, especially forecasts that come from individual analysts, but Nvidia and Supermicro warrant further consideration.\n\nNvidia: a 61% year-to-date gain\n\nNvidia specializes in accelerated computing, a discipline that uses specialized hardware and software to speed up complex data center workloads like 3D simulations, visualizations, and artificial intelligence. Nvidia dominates the market for data center accelerators due to its invention of the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999 and its subsequent launch of the CUDA programming model in 2006.\n\nWhile GPUs were initially designed to accelerate graphics workloads, CUDA let developers unlock their parallel processing capabilities for other applications. Ultimately, that innovation led Nvidia to the top of the supercomputer accelerator market. According to analysts, the company accounted for 98% of data center GPU sales and 92% of generative AI processor sales last year.\n\nThe CUDA ecosystem has expanded over the years, so developers can now build all sorts of GPU-accelerated applications. Moreover, Nvidia now sells subscription software and cloud services built atop CUDA. For instance, Nvidia AI Enterprise is a software platform that streamlines AI application development across various use cases, from recommender systems in retail to route optimization in logistics to computer vision in robotics.\n\nNvidia reported stellar financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue rose 265% to $22.1 billion, and non-GAAP net income soared 486% to $5.16 per diluted share. That momentum was driven by demand for data center products, especially those related to AI. Additionally, Nvidia said its nascent software and services business reached an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion, showing that the company is successfully diversifying beyond GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement guided for revenue growth of 190% in the first quarter. At the same time, the company expects non-GAAP operating expenses to climb just 56%, implying that earnings will once again increase much faster than revenue. That momentum is bound to slow at some point, but Nvidia is undoubtedly well positioned to monetize AI.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 35% annually over the next three to five years. That consensus forecast makes its current valuation of 69.3 times earnings look somewhat pricey; I doubt shareholders will see 69% upside over the next year. More importantly, while I think patient investors can purchase a very small position today, I would personally feel more comfortable buying shares if the PEG ratio -- currently at 1.98 (69.3 divided by 35) -- were closer to 1.5.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: a 166% year-to-date gain\n\nSuper Micro Computer develops and manufactures high-performance computing platforms comprising server, storage, and networking solutions. Its products incorporate technologies from suppliers like Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices, and they address various use cases across enterprise data centers and cloud data centers, including artificial intelligence.\n\nSupermicro is laser-focused on rapid development, such that it often beats peers to market with new products. To quote Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt, \"Supermicro has developed a model that is very, very quick to market. They usually have the widest portfolio of products when a new product comes out from Nvidia or AMD or Intel.\" That advantage is helping Supermicro gain ground on competitors like Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The company accounted for 10% of AI server sales last year, but that figure will reach 17% by 2026, according to analysts at Bank of America.\n\nSupermicro reported strong financial results in its fiscal second quarter (ended Dec. 31). Revenue increased 103% to $3.6 billion and non-GAAP net income jumped 71% to $5.59 per diluted share. Better yet, management expects revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share to soar 205% and 244%, respectively, in the third quarter.\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro cannot maintain triple-digit growth indefinitely, but the company is certainly well positioned to benefit as businesses spend more on AI. Wall Street expects Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 50% annually over the next three to five years. In that context, the current valuation of 61.5 times earnings looks relatively reasonable, despite being a significant premium to the three-year average of 21.1 times earnings.\n\nPersonally, I doubt Supermicro stock will return 91% over the next 12 months, but I would be comfortable buying a small position today. However, before investors add shares to their portfolios, they should be aware of a near-term risk. Supermicro broke precedent earlier this month when it chose not to announce preliminary results for the third quarter. That sent the stock tumbling on April 19.\n\nIt's possible the official earnings report -- slated for release on April 30 -- contains some very disappointing news. Alternatively, management may have decided to skip preliminary results because the quarter went precisely as expected.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this server technology company have returned -22%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, which Super Micro falls in, has lost 9.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSuper Micro is expected to post earnings of $5.94 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +264.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.17 points to a change of +87.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $29.71 indicates a change of +34% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Super Micro.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +217.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.73 billion and $19.69 billion estimates indicate +106.9% and +33.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.66 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +103.3%. EPS of $5.59 for the same period compares with $3.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +14.02%. The EPS surprise was +2.01%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Super Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should You Buy Super Micro Computer Stock Before Tuesday?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, provides high-performance servers built to withstand the rigors of artificial intelligence (AI) processing. The company has become a poster child of the AI boom and is scheduled to report the results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31) after the market close on Tuesday. AI investors will be sitting on the edge of their seats, as Supermicro could provide insight into the overall state of demand for AI.\n\nThe stock has gained a remarkable 828% since 2023 kicked off and is already up 168% so far this year (as of this writing). Supermicro's servers have provided the computational horsepower necessary to run the massive large language models (LLMs) that underpin generative AI, offering everything from modular components to full rack-scale solutions. Just last month, its stunning performance earned it a spot in the S&P 500 Index, \"which tracks the 500 of the most valuable companies\" traded on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nSupermicro has been one of the frontrunners in the AI revolution, but the stock's meteoric rise has investors wondering what's to come. Should investors buy the stock before its third-quarter results are released? Let's dig in to see what the evidence suggests. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat's in the cards for Supermicro on Tuesday\n\nDemand for Supermicro's AI-focused server solutions has been unprecedented, leaving Wall Street scrambling to keep up with its soaring stock price and the accelerating demand for its products. Helping fuel that demand is Supermicro's partnerships with chip makers, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others, giving the company nearly unfettered access to the chips needed for AI processing.\n\nThis has helped the company meet much of the demand sparked by generative AI and eclipsing analysts' expectations in the most recent quarter. As a result, Wall Street has been gradually increasing its estimates over the past three months.\n\nFor the third quarter, analysts expect revenue to surge 211% to $3.99 billion, with earnings per share (EPS) soaring from $1.61 to $5.84, an increase of 263%. These are high expectations, to be sure, but not undeserved, given Supermicro's recent performance.\n\nFor its fiscal second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue more than doubled to $3.66 billion and its EPS jumped 65% -- despite heavy capital investment to meet future demand. Furthermore, management's outlook is calling for revenue of $3.9 billion and EPS of $5.22 at the midpoint of its guidance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis time, however Supermicro has thrown a wrench in the works. In seven of the previous eight quarters, Supermicro issued a press release that provided not only the date of its financial release, but provided preliminary financial results. Last week, the company said it would announce its third-quarter results on Tuesday -- but no preliminary release was forthcoming. There could be any number of reasons for the omission, but investors fear Supermicro's results might be lacking -- and the stock crashed 24% on April 19 on the (lack of) news.\n\nShould you buy Supermicro stock now or wait until after earnings?\n\nFor investors looking to own a piece of a company, trying to time the daily machinations of the stock market is a fool's errand. Those with a long investing time horizon would do well to simply buy the stock and hold on for the ride. Why? There's simply no way to know for sure how investors will react and whether the stock will rise or fall following Supermicro's financial report.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be optimistic over the long term. Supermicro is on the cutting edge of server design and has built strong relationships with chipmakers, assuring the company of a steady supply of AI-centric processors.\n\nFurthermore, Supermicro is stealing share from the competition, according to industry experts. Barclays analyst George Wang posits that \"[Supermicro] has 7% market share globally, implying further share gains ahead are likely,\" Wang said. He believes the company is gaining market share at the expense of larger rivals Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n\nSupermicro has grown at five times the industry average over the past year and is investing heavily in its infrastructure, which will support future growth. The company is expanding its production facilities, which will increase its production capacity to support annual sales of up to $25 billion.\n\nThe excitement regarding the adoption of generative AI has attracted plenty of fair-weather investors, increasing the volatility of many of the stocks in the space, and Supermicro certainly isn't immune.\n\nEstimates vary wildly regarding the potential size of the AI market, but one of the more moderate views suggests the generative AI market will be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nIf the estimated range is even close to reality -- and I believe it is -- the runway ahead is long. Despite its significant run-up, Supermicro stock is currently selling for just 2 times next year's sales, an attractive price given the opportunity.\n\nFor those looking beyond next week, Supermicro has all the earmarks of a solid long-term buy -- even ahead of the company's highly anticipated earnings and no matter what happens after the report.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 oversold midcap stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our coverage of overbought, oversold, small cap, and mid cap stocks along with the latest stock market news, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Oversold MidCap Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSince stocks are publicly traded, their prices fluctuate in response to economic and political news. The news can either cover specific firms or the broader economy, with this principle also determining the equities whose prices fluctuate in response to daily events. These fluctuations can be measured through indicators that can quantify whether a stock is oversold or overbought. These two descriptors of stock performance stem from the fact that human decisions, particularly those surrounding assets, are influenced by the market itself. As a result, collectively buying or selling stocks can make them oversold or overbought, and provide some opportunity to make a profit from stability that follows.\n\nStocks are determined to be overbought or oversold through an indicator called the relative strength index. This indicator measures share price performance and is often read along with current share prices to help make a trading decision. So, for instance, if a stock is thought to be oversold, and its price is rising, then some traders could be comfortable buying it. For more details on what RSI readings determine whether a stock is overbought or oversold, you can take a look at 11 Oversold Value Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nMost news and media attention is focused on a collective of elite stocks called mega caps. These are among the largest companies in the world and are worth trillions of dollars. However, as a large portion of their share price growth has already occurred, and they control major sections of their markets, in terms of growth, mega cap stocks often lose out when compared to other stocks. These 'other' stocks can include small cap and mid cap stocks, and for the former, you can take a look at 15 Small-Cap Stocks with High Potential.\n\nMidCap stocks are those stocks that have a market value ranging between $2 billion and $10 billion. They offer investors more stability than small cap stocks due to their stable business models and market share. Additionally, mid cap stocks also carry the potential to grow big in case of growth companies, and stability if the shares belong to stocks in the consumer staples sector.\n\nLooking at some recent top performing mid cap stocks, Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX), Janux Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:JANX), and Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALPN) have all delivered triple digit percentage returns year to date in 2024. Interestingly, not only are all of these stocks mid cap stocks, but they are also biotechnology firms. This allows them to collectively demonstrate the strong potential of the biotech sector, which always lures investors to pile in millions of dollars in research and development with the hopes of a proper payout in terms of share price performance should treatments secure regulatory clearance and patient adoption. To take a look at some mid and small cap biotechnology stocks that hedge funds are also buying, you can take a look at the 13 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $20.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting gears, the start of the second quarter of 2024 has seen investors shift their expectations for the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. Heading into the year and throughout Q1 2024, Wall Street was focused on artificial intelligence, and investors were optimistic about early rate cuts as well. However, inflation data for March and the strong performance of the labor market have shifted expectations and now, most folks expect fewer rate cuts in 2024. At the same time, with April 2024 coming to an end, AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a lot to prove too. While not a mid cap stock, NVIDIA's shares are up by 58% year to date and a stunning 421% since the start of 2023. Yet, the stock dropped by 10%, in a silent loss of $280 billion of market value that took place on the same trading day.\n\nSo what happened to NVIDIA's shares? Well, it was due to nothing that Jensen Huang or his team did. Instead, NVIDIA's shares appeared to have lost 10% of their value due to peer and rival Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) breaking from tradition and not issuing a preliminary financial report for its Q1 2024 performance. It appears that Wall Street is quite jittery, and investors are eager to position themselves for any untoward financial news in the Q1 2024 earnings season as they adjusted their portfolios well in advance of any official numbers from Super Micro. This adjustment appears to have taken place for NVIDIA as well and shone the spotlight even brighter on the upcoming earnings of the Santa Clara, California based semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most oversold stocks. A couple of names are McGrath RentCorp (NASDAQ:MGRC), VinFast Auto Ltd. (NASDAQ:VFS), and PowerSchool Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:PWSC). 11 Oversold MidCap Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most oversold mid cap stocks to buy, we selected mid cap stocks with the lowest Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings and average analyst rating of Buy or better.\n\nFor these oversold mid cap stocks we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "title": "Is Super Micro (SMCI) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Super Micro Computer (SMCI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nSuper Micro currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.92, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.92 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Super Micro here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Super Micro, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in SMCI?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Super Micro, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $22.15.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Super Micro. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Super Micro.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.94 a share, just five days from its upcoming earnings release on April 30, 2024.\n\nSMCI has an Earnings ESP figure of 16.35%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $6.94 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.97.\n\nSMCI is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Nvidia (NVDA) as well.\n\nNvidia, which is readying to report earnings on May 22, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $5.63 a share, and NVDA is 27 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nNvidia's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2.5% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.49.\n\nSMCI and NVDA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

While there are many competitors in this field, few offer the customizability that Supermicro does, as its product lines allow customers to specify their computing load sizes and specialty. So, whether a client wants to dedicate their server to running large workload AI models or smaller engineering simulation workloads, Supermicro has them covered.\n\nBut none of that explains why the stock has dropped so aggressively as of late, as its business is doing fantastic. In fact, management expects revenue to grow at a 219% pace in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended March 31).\n\nWe'll find out more on April 30, but that's all investors know right now. And therein lies the problem.\n\nThe last time Supermicro announced its earnings report date, it pre-reported earnings. Companies usually elect to pre-report earnings if there is significant news that could drastically move the stock -- whether good or bad. The second-quarter report was full of great news and included Supermicro exceeding management's guidance of 50% to 61% growth drastically, as revenue rose 103%.\n\nThe Q3 earnings announcement did not hint at results, so investors can only assume the results were in line with expectations. This is a problem, as the stock was trading in an area that required an earnings beat.\n\nThe stock is the most attractive it has been in months\n\nBecause Supermicro is a profitable business, we'll use its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value the company and understand the expectations built into the stock. However, because we're assessing forward expectations, we'll use the forward P/E, which uses analyst projections for earnings over the next 12 months.\n\nSuper Micro Computer traded at more than 50 times forward earnings at its peak. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis is very expensive and eclipses the level that AI-king Nvidia has traded around.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore the drop, Supermicro still commanded a premium of about 45 times forward earnings -- a much higher level than Nvidia, which trades for 31 times forward earnings. But after its latest drop, Supermicro and Nvidia are trading at around the same levels.\n\nThis may tempt investors to hop back in, as Supermicro's growth is projected to be much higher than Nvidia's. Supermicro is just now experiencing the demand for its products that Nvidia felt last year.\n\nHowever, with the violent stock movement, it may be best to wait until after the Q3 earnings report. On the flip side, if Supermicro beats expectations (but does not blow them out of the water like it did in Q2), the beat may prompt the stock to have a solid rise.\n\nSo, if investors are interested in owning the stock, I don't think there's any harm in taking a small position before earnings, as the sell-off is likely overdone. However, the stock movement may not always be rational because there was a lot of hype in the stock (dare I say a bubble). Because there isn't a lot of rationality left in Supermicro's stock, I'll elect to stay away from it until things return to normal (which may not occur for another year).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Alarm Bells: 3 Overvalued Tech Stocks to Sell Before the AI Bubble Bursts",
        "content": "As the days pass and the market slowdown continues, many analysts are wondering if the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble has finally popped. From a logical perspective, several companies have disproportionately benefited from the AI moniker and related marketing. However, a deeper question remains, even as price corrections sweep across the AI giants and their affiliates. What companies currently offer overvalued tech stocks to sell if the bubble bursts more dramatically than expected?\n\nThis question stems from the fundamental misunderstanding many retail investors have about what drives the value of AI applications. That\u2019s because many people today still misconceive AI as a truly intelligent construct capable of \u201cthinking\u201d. The current reality is that all commercially available AIs are highly customized algorithms capable of calculating and aggregating the probability of data relationships. As such, investors should be on the lookout for companies that have overly touted AI as a revenue driver.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the sensational interest in AI over the last 12 months, Arm Holdings\u2019 (NASDAQ:ARM) value has risen by 50% since debuting on September 14, 2023. At an initial public offering price of $51.00 per share, the company\u2019s opening value sat at $54.5 billion. This makes it the largest IPO since 2021, and one in which several investors have ridden the AI hype to generous returns in the last six months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nARM stock has returned 39% year-to-date, but investors might want to consider whether or not this is a fair valuation. For example, ARM does not manufacture anything, rather it is an engineering company that designs and licenses intellectual property. As such, it risks losing a competitive edge should other companies figure out how to reverse engineer its products.\n\nMoreover, ARM\u2019s highly specialized central processing unit designs rely on substantial demand to effectively drive licensing revenue. Thus, the company is at the mercy of the AI adoption rush, which could slow and damage shareholder value.\n\nInformatica (INFA) AI Artificial Intelligence.

AI stocks\n\nSource: Tapati Rinchumrus / Shutterstock.com\n\nA mid-sized fish in a colossal pond, Informatica (NYSE:INFA) has strategically navigated the new AI landscape to stunning gains in the last year. Up over 100% in 12 months, INFA stock\u2019s rapid growth mirrors that of a tech company disrupting the status quo. However, therein lies the issue, as Informatica is not an exceptionally innovative company among cloud service providers.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite this, the company\u2019s overall financial performance has been exceptional thanks to turning a profit in Q3 of 2023. However, some analysts argue the company\u2019s base intrinsic value should be around $26.72. This suggests that the current trading price of $31.39 is overvalued by 13%. On top of this debate, Salesforce\u2019s (NYSE:CRM) failed acquisition attempt has lowered INFA\u2019s value slightly in the past week.\n\nUltimately, the company has been able to successfully ride a substantial adoption wave. Yet, should the generous leaps in revenue slow, the stock could stumble.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stunning performer on the AI stage, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) deserves a little more scrutiny than it has gotten. Aside from scandals involving compromised products and the sale of embargoed technologies to Iran, the company\u2019s products may not justify its valuation. This issue stems from its main revenue drivers being information technology hardware and the software to optimize its use.\n\nOn paper, this seems like a thrilling combination, as it has allowed SMCI to tailor several applications to any customer. The reality is, however, that scalability could suffer should an AI bubble burst and temporarily impede customer interest in acquisition. Mix in the potential risk of future morally gray business decisions from leadership, and SMCI\u2019s sticker price might need a second look.\n\nOverall, the company\u2019s healthy financial performance protects it, though its price-to-earnings ratio of 59.55x\u00a0 sits well above the industry average. Therefore, SMCI could fall into the category of overvalued tech stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) closed the latest trading day at $754.72, indicating a -0.94% change from the previous session's end. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.02%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.11%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.1%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the server technology company had lost 25.68% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 5.13% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.01% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Super Micro Computer will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on April 30, 2024. In that report, analysts expect Super Micro Computer to post earnings of $5.97 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 266.26%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $4.11 billion, up 219.92% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $22.15 per share and a revenue of $14.76 billion, signifying shifts of +87.55% and +107.26%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Super Micro Computer. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 2.93% higher. Super Micro Computer currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, Super Micro Computer is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 34.4. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.97, so one might conclude that Super Micro Computer is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nInvestors should also note that SMCI has a PEG ratio of 0.62 right now. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer- Storage Devices industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.34 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer- Storage Devices industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 24, finds itself in the top 10% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

        "content": "Tesla, Airbnb upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nBofA upgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $220 after the company reported what the firm says were better-than-expected Q1 results. Mizuho upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $200, up from $150. The potential launch of sponsored listings is expected to generate double-digit EBITDA upside over the long-term, the firm tells investors in a research note. Wells Fargo upgraded Neurocrine (NBIX) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $170, up from $140. The firm thinks the company's pipeline is \"turning a corner.\" Keefe Bruyette upgraded Globe Life (GL) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $110, down from $130. The stock is down 40% over the past six weeks from a Department of Justice subpoena over agent sales practices and a short report alleging wider spread fraud, and while the firm acknowledges ongoing risk from these accusations, it feels better following Globe Life's response on the Q2 earnings call that included a willingness to accelerate and possibly increase buybacks. B. Riley upgraded Children's Place(PLCE) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $7, down from $12. The firm says that if the company can achieve Riley's \"muted\" 2024 and 2025 estimates, there is a chance the company's \"odd and unlikely set of circumstances may yield a positive outcome for shareholders in time.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Molson Coors(TAP) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $56, down from $66The firm says that while Molson has sounded bullish on Q1 trends and spring shelf space resets, it believes cycling a record sales and profit year \"could be extremely difficult.\" Oppenheimer downgraded MSCI (MSCI) to Perform from Outperform. The firm's downgrade is predicated upon increased risk of downward earnings revision. Benchmark downgraded Hibbett (HIBB) to Hold from Buy after JD Sports Fashion announced an agreement to acquire the company for $87.50 per share in cash. BTIG downgraded HashiCorp (HCP) to Neutral from Buy without a price target. The firm sees a balanced risk/reward after the stock's recent run following takeover speculation. Piper Sandler downgraded Independent Bank (IBTX) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $38, down from $48. The firm believes Independent Bank \"looks poised to underperform peers\" from an overall profitability perspective.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nBofA initiated coverage of GE Vernova(GEV) with a Neutral rating and $150 price target. While the firm views shares as \"an attractive multi-year self-help story,\" it does not have conviction on near-term positive catalysts. BofA resumed coverage of Altice USA(ATUS) with an Underperform rating and $1.50 price target. The firm believes that Altice USA \"remains fundamentally challenged\" and does not believe a sale to Charter (CHTR) is likely in the near term. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Kura Sushi (KRUS) with a Neutral rating and $114 price target. The firm is \"very impressed\" by the company but says Kura's risk/reward is relatively balanced at current levels with the stock's valuation already reflective of a sizable premium to its full-service industry peer set, at least using conventional metrics. KeyBanc initiated coverage of Supermicro (SMCI) with a Sector Weight rating and no price target. The shares are currently trading relatively in line with Supermicro's infrastructure peer group, the firm tells investors in a research note. Wells Fargo resumed coverage of APA Corp.(APA) with an Overweight rating and $55 price target. The firm says long-duration option value for Suriname and global oil production support bullish rating.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) Ticks All The Boxes When It Comes To Earnings Growth",
        "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer's Improving Profits\n\nIn the last three years Super Micro Computer's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. It's good to see that Super Micro Computer's EPS has grown from US$11.06 to US$12.51 over twelve months. That's a 13% gain; respectable growth in the broader scheme of things.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note Super Micro Computer achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 39% to US$9.3b. That's progress.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Super Micro Computer?\n\nAre Super Micro Computer Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$45b company like Super Micro Computer. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$6.4b. Coming in at 14% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.\n\nIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Super Micro Computer, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$14m.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Super Micro Computer CEO received total compensation of only US$1.0 in the year to June 2023. You could consider this pay as somewhat symbolic, which suggests the CEO does not need a lot of compensation to stay motivated. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\n\nDoes Super Micro Computer Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nAs previously touched on, Super Micro Computer is a growing business, which is encouraging. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Super Micro Computer, but the fun does not stop there. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. It is worth noting though that we have found 4 warning signs for Super Micro Computer (2 are significant!) that you need to take into consideration.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 30, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis server technology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.97 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +266.3%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $4.11 billion, up 219.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.47% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Super Micro?\n\nFor Super Micro, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +16.35%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Super Micro will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Super Micro would post earnings of $5.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.59, delivering a surprise of +2.01%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nSuper Micro appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, Western Digital (WDC) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.21 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +115.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.33 billion, up 18.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Western Digital has been revised 17.2% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 124.30%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Western Digital will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Mega-Cap Marvels: 3 Powerhouse Picks from IBD\u2019s Prestigious Big Cap 20",
        "content": "The primary focus of Investor\u2019s Business Daily\u2019sIBD Big Cap 20\u00a0list is large-capitalization stocks. The reasoning behind these picks is that they are steady, conservative equities that investors can expect consistency from. Some of the firms on this list even provide dividends. The Big Cap 20 includes names that can rally a great deal despite their large size. Indeed, many of the names over the years, such as ServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) have all rallied tremendously during their tenures on the IBD\u2019s Big Cap 20. Here are three stocks from the IBD\u2019s Big Cap 20 that look poised to deliver outsized gains for investors in the medium term and the long term.\n\nMartin Marietta (MLM) stocks to buy: construction workers work on a concrete floor\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMartin Marietta (NYSE:MLM) provides raw construction materials. The company is benefiting from Washington\u2019s huge infrastructure spending and from U.S. factories being built.\n\nIndeed, British bank HSBC wrote that the firm would benefit from its pricing power as a result of Washington\u2019s infrastructure initiatives.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, investment bank Jeffries recently identified Martin Marietta as one of 12 high-quality mid-cap names to buy. The bank believes that mid-cap names have been beaten down and are poised to rally.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, MLM\u2019s top line climbed 9% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.6 billion, while its earnings per share from continuing operations soared 54% year-over-year to $4.63.\n\nMLM has an attractive enterprise/EBITDA ratio of 18 times.\n\nThe combination of MLM\u2019s strong growth catalysts and low valuation makes it one of the more attractive members of IBD\u2019s Big Cap 20.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines (AEM) A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it. Stocks to Buy in March\n\nSource: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) specializes in mining gold. As gold prices have climbed, AEM stock has gone along for the ride, rising 29% over in the last three months.\n\nThere are many reasons for the large gains in gold prices. Among these catalysts are relatively high inflation along with America\u2019s huge, rapidly rising debt. The continuous, sizeable purchases of the metal by many of the world\u2019s central banks have also caused an increase in gold pricing. None of these catalysts looks likely to weaken significantly anytime soon, so gold prices are likely to continue to climb for the foreseeable future, further lifting AEM in the process.\n\nAlso important is a little-noticed development: the very popular retail chain Costco (NYSE:COST) is now selling $100 million to $200 million in gold and silver monthly, Wells Fargo estimated recently. Costco\u2019s decision to sell the metals is enabling America\u2019s middle class to invest in them more easily than ever before. I believe that this initiative has set up a virtuous cycle in which the middle class is buying the metals, causing their prices to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nAEM has an attractive trailing price-earnings ratio of 16 times and a significant dividend yield of 2.5%.\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nVertiv (NYSE:VRT) provides monitoring systems and power management products for data centers.\n\nWith the rapid proliferation of AI causing the demand for data centers to jump, VRT\u2019s top and bottom lines have soared in recent quarters. Since the utilization of AI will continue to increase very rapidly for many years, VRT\u2019s long-term outlook is strong.\n\nMoreover, Wall Street appears to be falling in love with the name, as many investment banks have recently issued positive notes on the stock.\n\nFor example, Bank of America recently added VRT to its list of \u201cbest investment ideas,\u201d while Oppenheimer started coverage of the name with an \u201coutperform\u201d rating.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in SMCI and NOW.

        "title": "7 AI Stocks That Could Be Heading Six-Feet Under",
        "content": "If the recent sell-off with artificial intelligence stocks has you thinking that this is a prime \u201cbuy the dip\u201d opportunity, think again. What should be top of mind instead is what are the AI stocks to sell.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance that the AI stock rout of April 19 was not an overreaction, but an appropriate response by the market in light of recent development with top AI software and hardware companies.\n\nUntil now, the market has priced-in continued high growth for the sector as a near certainty. Hence, the reporting of fiscal results that come up even a little short of these expectations causing massive disappointment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat\u2019s not all. If, one after another, the stocks with the greatest AI-related exposure fall short, a continued AI stock sell-off is likely to have a sharper impact on stocks with more dubious AI catalysts.\n\nSo, in order to take heed of this market warning, what are the AI stocks to sell? Start with these seven.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs recently as March, it may have seemed as if 2024 was going to be Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 (NASDAQ:AMD) \u201cyear of AI,\u201d much like 2023 was the \u201cyear of AI\u201d for this chip designer\u2019s main rival, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nHowever, after surging to $227.30 per share earlier this year, AMD stock has pulled back. The latest AI stock sell-off has led to a further reversal for shares. Before, investors weren\u2019t afraid to bid up AMD, in anticipation of the company beating its own forecasts, regarding sales of its MI300 series of AI accelerators.\n\nNow, the market is erring toward caution. Although Advanced Micro Devices may just well beat its $3.5 billion sales forecast for the MI300, not to mention end up reporting very promising initial numbers for its AI-PC chip sales, stay away as sentiment leans bearish in the near-term.\n\nIntel (INTC) The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.\n\nSource: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a good example of what I was talking about above regarding questionable AI stocks to sell. During the previous fall and winter, investors warmed back up to this chipmaker, due to increased appreciation of its own AI chip catalyst.\n\nThis catalyst joined another existing catalyst, Intel\u2019s build out of its foundry business. With two catalysts in play, the market became very much more confident in a possible INTC stock comeback after years of underperformance. Since then, however, cracks have emerged with the foundry catalyst, as I\u2019ve pointed out previously.\n\nGoing forward, China-related headwinds could keep shares trending lower. It\u2019s also possible that uncertainty about Intel\u2019s initial foray into AI chips increases as well. INTC is no longer priced as if a turnaround is guaranteed. Wait until this stock, trading for 25.2 times forward earnings, once again sports a heavily-discounted valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo seen on billboard, known as Palantir is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter looking at two AI hardware stocks, let\u2019s look at Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), which since last year has been one of the hottest AI software stocks out there.\n\nAdmittedly, Palantir has been both aggressive and successful in capitalizing on the generative AI growth trend. At least, based on the enterprise software company\u2019s results from Q4 2023.\n\nEven as PLTR stock has sold off in recent months, Palantir\u2019s AI growth catalyst remains overly baked into its valuation. Shares sell for 62.2 times forward earnings. With shares this pricey, the market may get scared off by any indication of an impending growth slowdown.\n\nSuch an indication could arrive as soon as a few weeks from now post-market on May 6, Palantir next reports earnings. Even if results beat expectations, underwhelming guidance or customer growth numbers could drive a post-earnings plunge.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is one of the top AI stocks to sell. After all, it\u2019s the AI stock that\u2019s driven the aforementioned sharp sell-off.\n\nWhy has the market especially bailed on shares in this AI server builder? Mostly, because the company has decided not to release preliminary quarterly results.\n\nInvestors perceive this to mean disappointment, when Super Micro\u2019s latest fiscal performance and updates to guidance hit the street on April 30.\n\nSMCI stock skeptics have argued that recent growth, boosted by the tech sector\u2019s AI arms race, is likely to slow down. If proven correct, die hard and fair weather bulls alike may bail.\n\nWith this, it is very risky to continue holding a position in SMCI right now. Earnings are just a week away, and those deciding to hold on through earnings could end up \u201cholding the bag,\u201d as shares continue to plummet.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) shares have been affected somewhat by the AI stock sell-off, but these declines pale compared to massive sell-off shares experienced after the cloud data provider\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings release in late February.\n\nAs I have discussed previously, SNOW stock avalanched lower, due to both weak guidance, as well as an unexpected announcement of a CEO change. Since then, shares have kept declining, as investors walk back expectations. However, with the market sentiment about AI stocks in general shifting toward bearish, look out! Another big avalanche may be in the cards for SNOW shares.\n\nGen AI has been considered a growth catalyst for Snowflake. If the market\u2019s excitement about this trend is declining, a further reassessment for Snowflake\u2019s future growth prospects may soon follow. SNOW trades at a staggeringly-high 152.6 times earnings. This leaves big room for a rerating to the downside.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another example of a speculative name among the AI stocks to sell. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Larry discussed back in February, shares in this voice AI company skyrocketed in price, following news that Nvidia had invested in the company.\n\nFrenzy among meme speculators about SOUN stock persisted through March, yet so far this month, it has declined spectacularly. Initially, because of news of the company\u2019s plans to raise $150 million in capital through an at-the-market equity program. Shares sold off in response to the dilutive impact that this capital raise will have.\n\nThe broad sell-off in AI stocks is placing more pressure on SOUN. A market more cautious about AI plays likely means further big downside ahead. Even as this upstart still has Nvidia in its corner, as this $3.25 stock could quickly return to pre-meme prices of under $2 per share, stay away.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) had a rough go of it this week. First, following the leading chip foundry\u2019s latest earnings release on April 18, shares experienced a modest decline.\n\nDespite what was a solid earnings report overall, investors focused on the major negatives with the release.\n\nNamely, downbeat statements from management about overall chip demand this year. Then, TSM stock sank again on April 19. This time, because of the market jitters related to Super Micro Computer spilling over to other chip stocks. In the immediate term, further fears about an AI chip demand slowdown could place more pressure on TSM.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget that there\u2019s the \u201cknown unknown\u201d of a possible China-Taiwan conflict eventually happening.

        "title": "Exclusive-China acquired recently banned Nvidia chips in Super Micro, Dell servers, tenders show",
        "content": "By Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Max A. Cherney\n\nBEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese universities and research institutes recently obtained high-end Nvidia artificial intelligence chips through resellers, despite the U.S. widening a ban last year on the sale of such technology to China.\n\nA Reuters review of hundreds of tender documents shows 10 Chinese entities acquired advanced Nvidia chips embedded in server products made by Super Micro Computer Inc., Dell Technologies Inc. and Taiwan's Gigabyte Technology Co Ltd after the U.S. on Nov. 17 expanded the embargo to subject more chips and countries to licensing rules.\n\nSpecifically, the servers contained some of Nvidia's most advanced chips, according to the previously unreported tenders fulfilled between Nov. 20 and Feb. 28. While the U.S. bars Nvidia and its partners from selling advanced chips to China, including via third parties, the sale and purchase of the chips are not illegal in China.\n\nThe 11 sellers of the chips were little-known Chinese retailers. Reuters could not determine whether, in fulfilling the orders, they used stockpiles acquired before the U.S. tightened chip-export restrictions in November.\n\nContacted by Reuters, Nvidia said the tenders specify products that were exported and widely available before the restrictions. \"They do not indicate that any of our partners violated the export control rules and are a negligible fraction of the products sold worldwide,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe server makers said they complied with applicable laws or would investigate further.\n\nAmong the buyers were the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shandong Artificial Intelligence Institute, Hubei Earthquake Administration, the Shandong and Southwest universities, a tech investment firm owned by the Heilongjiang provincial government, a state-run aviation research centre, and a space science centre.\n\nNone of the Chinese buyers and retail sellers responded to questions from Reuters about the matter.\n\nDaniel Gerkin, a Washington-based partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis, said Nvidia chips could have been diverted to China without a manufacturer's knowledge, given a lack of visibility into downstream supply chains.\n\nIf the manufacturer had performed sufficient due diligence, \"it presumably would be challenging for the U.S. government to pursue an enforcement action\", he said.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department told Reuters it could not comment on any potential ongoing investigations, but said its Bureau of Industry and Security monitored diversions of restricted chips, conducted end-use checks and examined potential breaches.\n\nStory continues\n\nOfficials would investigate credible allegations of violations, including through the use of shell companies, a spokesperson said.\n\nNvidia said systems built with its graphic processing units (GPUs) - chips that break computer tasks into smaller pieces and process them together - and resold by third parties must comply with U.S. restrictions.\n\n\"If we determine that any product was subsequently resold in violation of U.S. export control rules, we'll work with our customers to take appropriate action,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nSuper Micro said it complied with U.S. requirements on the sale and export of GPU systems to regions and parties that require licenses.\n\n\"If we become aware that a third party has exported or reexported without the required licenses, we investigate the matter and take appropriate action,\" it said.\n\nIn a letter to Reuters on behalf of Super Micro, U.S. law firm Clare Locke said its client \"goes above and beyond what U.S. export restrictions require\" by proactively taking steps to ensure its customers do not violate the curbs.\n\nIn relation to the tenders that identified its products, Super Micro said they represent \"older generation or general purpose servers not capable of the largest scale AI operations that were available in China prior to the export control regulations\". The awarded suppliers \"are not known Supermicro customers\", the company said.\n\nA Dell spokesperson said the company \"found no evidence of shipping products configured with the restricted chips you listed to the entities you named\", but that it would continue to investigate.\n\n\"Our distributors and resellers are required to comply with all applicable global regulations and export controls. If we become aware of a distributor or reseller that is not complying with these obligations, we take appropriate actions, including termination of our relationship,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nGigabyte said in an email that it complied with Taiwanese laws and international regulations. It did not respond to subsequent questions about tenders that identified its products as a source of banned Nvidia chips. Taiwan's economy ministry said it expected Taiwanese companies to respect U.S. export controls.\n\nRESEARCH BENEFITS\n\nThe transactions were disclosed in a dozen of the tenders, which Reuters found on public databases that cover only a fraction of purchases by China's state entities. But the small snapshot shows China still has access to advanced chips that U.S. officials say could support AI for military applications, such as the modernisation of China's defence forces or for developing weapons like hypersonic missiles.\n\nEach of the purchases were limited to several servers and several dozen banned chips. Still, they could be useful for training models and conducting advanced research, according to seven analysts and industry executives.\n\nThe tenders - valued at between 71,500 yuan and 1.86 million yuan, or about $10,000 and $259,000 - did not specify the intended uses.\n\nUnder Chinese law, procuring agencies representing state or state-affiliated buyers must check that a supplier can fulfil the tender before it is announced as the winner and a contract is signed.\n\nReuters only analysed tenders whose winners had been announced.\n\nCompanies and people accused of violating U.S. export controls can face civil or criminal penalties in the U.S., including fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars and up to 20 years in prison for individuals.\n\nReuters last year reported that an underground trade in Nvidia chips had emerged in China, as evident at Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei electronics market in June, before the U.S. widened its curbs. On a return visit in December, the vendors who had spoken to Reuters months earlier had gone, and other sellers said they did not know why they left.\n\nReuters couldn't establish why the vendors were no longer at the market.\n\n($1 = 7.1932 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Cherney reported from San Francisco.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Fall 19% and 65%, According to a Pair of Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are suddenly seeing red. The segment plunged last week after a pair of earnings-driven declines from ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor, two leaders in semiconductor manufacturing, sparked a broader sell-off.\n\nOn Friday, one analyst questioned Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) decision not to release preliminary revenue results, even though it had become a custom, and that led to a bloodbath. Supermicro stock finished the session down 23%, Arm Holdings lost 17%, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) finished the day down 10%.\n\nIs the AI bubble bursting, or is this just a temporary sell-off? No one knows the answer to that question, but a pair of Wall Street analysts think two top AI stocks, Nvidia and Supermicro, are both headed lower. Keep reading to see why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia: 19% downside\n\nNvidia has been the undisputed leader in the AI boom. While OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT kicked off the generative AI race, Nvidia has raked in the bulk of the industry profits thus far, as sales of its graphics processing units (GPUs) and related components form the backbone of the infrastructure that makes AI apps, like ChatGPT, work.\n\nNvidia's revenue has tripled in recent quarters, driven by soaring AI demand, and its profits have grown even more rapidly. However, one analyst thinks that Nvidia could have further to fall after Friday's sell-off.\n\nDA Davidson's Gil Luria weighed in on Nvidia stock after the company's February earnings report with a neutral rating and a price target of $620. This implied a decline of 21% at the time, or 19% from Friday's close.\n\nLuria acknowledged that Nvidia delivered strong results and is in a position to continue dominating the AI compute space, but he also expects the company's competitors to catch up. The analyst sees a chance that Nvidia's demand will decline in the next four to six quarters.\n\nCompetition is indeed coming for Nvidia, as AMD and Intel have both launched competing AI GPUs. However, it's still too early to tell if they'll take significant market share from Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's growth rate is certain to slow in the coming quarters as it will face more difficult comparisons, but the Wall Street consensus calls for strong growth to continue. If revenue were to decline as Luria seems to imply, at least in some categories, the stock would almost certainly plunge.\n\n2. Supermicro: 65% downside\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro has been a big winner from the AI boom. The maker of high-density servers, which work especially well for running AI applications, has skyrocketed since the beginning of 2023. Its revenue is also soaring, up more than 100% in its most recent quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, not every analyst is sold on Supermicro's potential. Susquehanna rated the stock a sell, with a price target of just $250 after the company's earnings report at the end of January. This implies a 65% decline in the stock from its current price.\n\nThe research firm acknowledged the secular growth in AI compute but saw a number of problems with the company's results. For example, despite soaring revenue growth, Supermicro's gross margin declined, which Susquehanna sees as a lack of leverage in its business model. It also noted a demanding working capital requirement, which may have led to the company's decision to raise $2 billion in March. Susquehanna also questioned the overall quality of the company's earnings.\n\nThe Friday sell-off in Supermicro shares could portend greater problems for the company if its third-quarter earnings report disappoints. Investors are expecting another surge in revenue when it reports earnings on April 30.\n\nIt would be a surprise for the company to miss its own guidance from late January, as there are still high expectations baked into the stock. Regardless of the numbers, investors should expect the volatility in Supermicro's stock to continue.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Super Micro Computer Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "The rush for companies to grab artificial intelligence (AI) market share has led to a surge in demand for the hardware that powers these powerful models and applications. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has been a significant benefactor, and the stock's exponential rise over the past year reflects that.\n\nAfter soaring from under $100 to over $1,200 per share, the stock -- and the broader market -- have taken a breather in recent weeks.\n\nExtreme price action can intimidate investors from buying a dip because they fear that the higher a stock soars, the further it will fall. But that could be an unwarranted fear in this case. Here is why Supermicro, as it is also known, could be a brilliant buy today.\n\nThe numbers support Super Micro Computer's meteoric run\n\nIt's hard to find a stock's price chart this impressive; gaining over 1,000% can take most stocks decades to accomplish, so hitting such a milestone in under 18 months is remarkable -- and rare. Artificial intelligence is the primary catalyst for this. According to some studies, AI's long-term potential is enormous ... a future trillion-dollar industry. Investors are scrambling to position their portfolios for that growth.\n\nSupermicro sells modular server systems and components for data centers. This is an ample opportunity because most companies don't want to design these massive computer systems from the ground up; they want quick, turnkey computing power, which is right in Supermicro's wheelhouse. SMCI Chart\n\nStock prices can often respond to expectations of what might happen, and the tremendous AI potential could justify some stock surges. Fortunately, hard numbers already support Supermicro's surging share price. The company has entered a growth spurt that saw its revenue grow 103% year over year in the second quarter of its 2024 fiscal year and 73% quarter over quarter. Management believes that growth is accelerating, guiding for over 200% year-over-year growth for the upcoming quarter.\n\nAnalysts believe the company will earn approximately $22.15 per share this fiscal year, which values the stock at a forward P/E of 43, despite its monstrous run over the past 18 months. In other words, Supermicro has already grown into the large shoes the market thinks it should own.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nInvesting is about looking to the future, and you might need sunglasses to see Wall Street's bright expectations for this company. Analysts believe Supermicro will grow earnings by an average of 50% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nThat's a high bar, but one that Supermicro seems able to clear. After all, revenue is growing at a triple-digit rate. The business is already profitable, so that should largely trickle down to the bottom line. It doesn't even factor in additional growth levers like share repurchases that management could enact as its cash balance swells.\n\nStory continues SMCI EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nHow likely is this to happen? Studies show that AI uses tremendous computing power, naturally stimulating demand for more data centers. According to a U.S. data center market report from Newmark, the footprint for data centers in America will double by 2030 due to demand for AI applications. Supermicro has noted that demand for its systems is growing faster than the broader industry, which bodes well for growth over the next five years.\n\nIs Super Micro Computer a buy?\n\nConsidering its massive price movement, one might assume that Supermicro is expensive, but the numbers show that's not true. Using the PEG ratio to value the stock based on its expected growth illustrates this. I generally look for PEG ratios of 1.5 or less, and Supermicro's PEG ratio is only 0.8 today. Assuming Supermicro delivers on analyst estimates, the stock is a bargain today for long-term investors and an easy buy.\n\nWhat if the company's performance falls short of expectations? Suppose actual long-term earnings growth is half of estimates, just 25% annually. The resulting 1.7 PEG ratio would still be somewhat reasonable for buyers today. That means that Supermicro would likely have to fall on its face to not generate satisfactory investment returns over the long term.\n\nInvesting offers no promises, but you can help your odds of success by finding situations where the reward is greater than the risks involved. The numbers show that Supermicro is one such opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Super Micro Computer's Soaring Stock Be in 2026?",
        "content": "Shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have set the market on fire in the past year with outstanding gains of 795%, and one analyst believes this red-hot rally is set to continue.\n\nSupermicro's business is booming thanks to the rapidly growing demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) server solutions, and Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah predicts Supermicro's red-hot growth is here to stay. He's upgraded his price target on the stock from $600 to $1,500. The updated price target is 54% higher than where the stock trades as of this writing.\n\nLet's look at the reasons why the analyst bumped his price target 2.5 times higher, and consider whether Supermicro could indeed hit that mark by 2026 per Loop Capital's prediction.\n\nTremendous growth lies ahead for Supermicro\n\nSupermicro's fiscal 2024 (ending June 30, 2024) revenue is expected to land at $14.5 billion based on the midpoint of management's guidance. That would be slightly more than double the company's fiscal 2023 revenue of $7.1 billion. Consensus estimates are calling for Supermicro's earnings to nearly double from $11.81 to $22.10 per share over the same period.\n\nHowever, as the following chart indicates, analysts are projecting Supermicro's pace of growth to slow down over the next two fiscal years (through fiscal 2026). SMCI Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nBaruah, however, believes Supermicro could generate between $30 billion and $40 billion of revenue in 2026. Its earnings, on the other hand, could jump to a range of $50 to $60 per share. In other words, the Loop Capital analyst expects both revenue and earnings to at least double over the next two or so years.\n\nThose numbers are far higher than what the consensus estimates indicate. However, a closer look at the AI server market that Supermicro serves and the moves it's making in this space indicates it could indeed hit Baruah's numbers.\n\nAnd comments from management on Supermicro's January earnings call support Baruah's target. According to CEO Charles Liang:\n\nToday, our production utilization rate is about 65% across our U.S.A, Netherlands, and Taiwan facilities, and they are quickly filling. To address this immediate capacity challenge, we are adding two new production facilities and warehouses near our Silicon Valley headquarter, which will be operating in a few months. The new Malaysia facility will focus on expanding our building blocks with lower costs and increased volume, while [the] other new facility will support our annual revenue capacity above $25 billion.\n\nSo, management already has plans for its top line to exceed $25 billion. Additionally, the company's focus on further enhancing its manufacturing capacity by investing in more infrastructure could set the stage for additional growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors can expect tremendous upside\n\nLoop Capital's $1,500 price target is based on the firm's baseline earnings per share forecast of $50 in fiscal 2026 and a forward earnings multiple of 30. This forward earnings multiple is in line with the Nasdaq 100 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).\n\nHowever, AI stocks tend to command a premium valuation thanks to their rapid growth, so there's a chance Supermicro could deliver even stronger upside than what the firm is forecasting. For instance, if Supermicro's top line increases to $30 billion in fiscal 2026, but the stock maintains its current price-to-sales multiple of 6, its market cap would jump to $180 billion, more than triple its current level.\n\nIt's also worth noting Supermicro's price-to-sales ratio is lower than the tech sector's average of 7. Investors, therefore, could still be getting a good deal on this AI stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Time to Cash Out? 3 Overvalued Tech Stocks to Dump Before the Selloff",
        "content": "Cracks are starting to form in the tech trade. After leading the market higher over the last 18 months, technology stocks are starting to waver. Since peaking in late March, the Nasdaq composite index has declined 6%. The pullback comes as markets adjust their outlook for interest rate cuts this year. In January, the market was pricing in at least six rate reductions in 2024. Now, only two interest rate cuts are anticipated.\n\nHigher for longer rates are troublesome for high-flying technology stocks, many of which are unprofitable and rely on heavy borrowing to fund their operations. Geopolitical instability and signs of waning demand for items ranging from smartphones to electric vehicles are also hurting sentiment and leading to a softening of prices. With the market beginning to slide, we look at whether it is time to cash out? Three overvalued tech stocks to dump before the selloff.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to talk about overvalued technology stocks and not mention Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). After all, SMCI stock has more than tripled this year and risen an astounding 715% in the last 12 months. It leads the S&P 500 index in terms of performance and it is currently trading at 73 times future earnings estimates, which is nearly three times higher than the average price-earnings ratio of 24.79 among S&P 500 listed stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf there\u2019s any stock that\u2019s due for a selloff, it would be Super Micro Computer. In a sign of just how frothy shares of the high-efficiency computer server maker have gotten, the current price targets on SMCI stock range from a high of $1,350 to a low of $250. It appears to be getting difficult to place a valuation on a stock that is growing at such a fast clip. Of course some people remain bullish on Super Micro Computer and its growth fueled by AI. But it wouldn\u2019t be advisable to buy shares at current levels.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) have run really far, really fast. Since mid-February of this year, MU stock has gained 42%. Can the run continue? Possibly. But the shares are also likely to pullback on any signs of weakness in the AI trade. Micron\u2019s stock has rallied since the company reported financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and provided upbeat forward guidance. It was also just announced that the company is receiving $6 billion from the federal government to fund the building of more factories.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron, which specializes in computer memory and USB flash drives, has said that it is benefitting from the current AI boom, with demand for its memory and computer data storage products rising sharply. The company provides memory and storage for new AI systems all over the world and is expecting to be a big winner in the artificial intelligence race. Micron has forecast first quarter 2024 revenues of $6.60 billion, which is ahead of the $6.02 billion that was expected by analysts.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt looks like a selloff in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) has begun. On the day of this writing, TSM stock is down 5% after the world\u2019s biggest microchip and semiconductor manufacturer reported strong first quarter financial results. TSMC, as the company is known, reported a Q1 net profit of $6.97 billion, up 9% from the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $6.65 billion. Revenue of $18.87 billion was up 13% from a year ago and also beat Wall Street forecasts.\n\nLooking ahead, TSMC said it expects revenue of $19.6 billion to $20.4 billion for the current second quarter of the year, and it forecast revenue growth this year of at least 20%. So why the selloff? Apparently, investors got spooked by the line in the earnings report noting that revenue from smartphone chips fell 16% year-over-year in Q1. The drop in TSM stock comes after a nearly 60% rally in the last 12 months and shows just how quickly sentiment around a high-flying stock can change.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Will IBM Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?",
        "content": "Technology powerhouse International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) used to be an industry giant. Big Blue's market cap peaked at $239 billion in the summer of 1999, sparking speculation about perhaps forming the world's first trillion-dollar company.\n\nBut the dot-com bubble popped, and IBM changed gears. The market cap reached $230 billion again in 2012, ending an era where other tech giants were copying IBM's one-stop IT shop business model.\n\nBut that year also marked a sharp strategy shift under newly appointed CEO Ginni Rometty. IBM stiff-armed the hardware side of its operations, apart from the unique mainframe systems segment. When Rometty handed off the reins to current CEO Arvind Krishna in the spring of 2020, IBM was refocused on hybrid cloud computing, data security, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAnd its market cap had dropped to just $106 billion.\n\nThe company has enjoyed another renaissance since then, joining the AI boom just a bit later than many peers. Currently perched at a total market value of $167 billion, is the reformed Big Blue finally destined for trillion-dollar greatness before the end of this decade?\n\nLet's set some realistic targets for IBM\n\nA starting point of $167 billion is pretty impressive. Only 45 of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index's household names can boast a larger market cap than IBM's today.\n\nOne-trillion is still a long way away, though. I'm talking about a sixfold jump, and share prices would rise even faster thanks to IBM's unstoppable habit of buying back shares by the boatload.\n\nSo if IBM has a chance of reaching $1 trillion at all, it won't be a quick and easy romp.\n\nThat's a sixfold gain in five years and change. Most stocks wouldn't even dream of it. And honestly, IBM faces some long odds here. Super Micro Computers(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) have posted the strongest gains on the stock market over the last five years.\n\nSupermicro soared on the wings of unique AI systems; Celsius was a literal penny stock five years ago, and its health-conscious energy drink had no distribution system or marketing to speak of. It's a lot easier to multiply those modest starting values than it is to list IBM from a $167 billion platform.\n\nAnd even then, Celsius barely reached the sixfold market cap multiplication target. Supermicro only made it halfway. CELH Market Cap Chart\n\nWhy I don't mind IBM missing the trillion-dollar mark\n\nSo the trillion-dollar goal looks nearly unreachable from IBM's current starting point, given only five or six years of AI-driven growth. That's alright. I still think IBM is one of the best AI buys in today's market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company can pull its weight with much milder price gains. It doesn't have to meet some arbitrary market-cap goal in five years. Remember, only one stock actually achieved a similar gain over the last five-year period, and that was from an optimal starting point. IBM isn't reinventing energy drinks here or on the verge of signing a global distribution deal with PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP). That's what it took to lift Celsius Holdings' stock sixfold in half a decade.\n\nBut the company is nibbling on explosive growth opportunities in the massive market for business-grade AI services. Its Watson AI engine and the related Watsonx generative AI platform were built for enterprise customers, and the long-term contracts are starting to drop in.\n\nMeanwhile, Big Blue's stock trades at just 22 times earnings and 12 times free cash flows. That's a bargain-basement deal next to AI-driven market darlings like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Supermicro. IBM's stock could triple and still look affordable next to these recent Wall Street rockets.\n\nSo yes, IBM offers a tempting blend of low share prices and exciting growth opportunity in the AI market. You should look away from that hard-to-reach trillion-dollar goal and embrace IBM for what it is -- an undervalued tech titan. You should pick up a few low-priced IBM shares while you can before the market really catches on to the company's valuable position in the enterprise AI industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Super Micro Computer Stock After It Soared 780%?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have captivated investors over the past year thanks to their collective contributions to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Perhaps the most closely followed is Nvidia, which specializes in graphics processing units (GPU) and data center services. Both of these computer network applications are important pillars for generative AI.\n\nOne of Nvidia's closest allies is IT infrastructure company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) -- often known as Supermicro. Its business is experiencing something of a renaissance at the moment, and that's thanks to inbound business from Nvidia. With its shares having soared 780% over the last year, some investors may think the Supermicro train has left the station.\n\nLet's break down Supermicro's entire business and assess if now is a good opportunity buy shares in this artificial intelligence (AI) innovator.\n\nThe next Nvidia?\n\nThe chart below illustrates an interesting dynamic. Shares of Nvidia and Supermicro have generally traded in parallel over the past few years. SMCI Chart\n\nSupermicro's business experienced quite a boom last year. During the company's second fiscal quarter, which ended Dec. 31, revenue increased 103% year over year to $3.66 billion. Moreover, the company raised its full-year guidance from a midpoint of $10.5 billion in total revenue to $14.5 billion.\n\nMuch of this growth is attributable to Supermicro's relationship with Nvidia. Considering that Nvidia is one of the core engines powering the overall AI picture right now and is also operating at record revenue and profit levels, it's not all that surprising to see investors cheer both of these companies on.\n\nHowever, despite the temptation to follow this momentum, smart investors should take a deeper look down the income statement. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThere's more to see than soaring revenue\n\nOne word of caution regarding Supermicro is that it is an extremely different business than Nvidia. Nvidia designs semiconductor chips that are used for supercomputing applications such as machine learning or helping train large language models (LLMs).\n\nBy contrast, Supermicro designs IT architecture systems, including storage clusters and server racks. This is a costly endeavor, which can be seen in the chart below illustrating Supermicro's capital expenditure (capex) trends. SMCI Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) Chart\n\nInvestors can see that last quarter's capex of $14.7 million was the highest for Supermicro in the last three years. Granted, demand for integrated IT solutions is going to vary from quarter to quarter, which will lead to some noticeable ebbs and flows.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, as the AI narrative continues to play out, I am curious how capex levels will impact Supermicro in the long run. More specifically, rising spending on parts for server racks could materially change Supermicro's margin profile over time. In fact, this is already happening to some degree.\n\nFor the period ended Dec. 31, Supermicro's gross margin was 15.4% -- down significantly from 18.7% one year prior.\n\nIs it too late to buy Supermicro stock?\n\nSupermicro's deteriorating margins tell me two things.\n\nFirst, unlike Nvidia, Supermicro does not have a high degree of pricing power. With loads of competitors, including Dell Technologies, International Business Machines, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Lenovo Group, Supermicro isn't exactly in a position of leverage.\n\nThe second concern I have about the margin profile is what it could mean for cash flow and liquidity in the long run. When you layer on top the fact that traditionally non-chip businesses are beginning to explore developing their own solutions, Supermicro's relationship with Nvidia appears far less lucrative. In turn, if demand for Nvidia's chips begins to plateau, this will have a domino effect on Supermicro.\n\nIn addition, with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5.9, Supermicro stock trades at a significant premium compared to its peers.\n\nGiven the trepidations above, I would say that it is not too late to buy Supermicro stock. In fact, I think it might be too early. Sure, the company operates in an interesting area within the AI realm and could serve as a hedge to other opportunities in your portfolio. However, given some of the risks outlined above, I question how attractive Supermicro's investment prospects are right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Insiders Made Right Decision To Sell As Super Micro Computer Dips 21%",
        "content": "By selling US$27m worth of Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock at an average sell price of US$303 over the last year, insiders seemed to have made the most of their holdings. The company's market valuation decreased by US$11b after the stock price dropped 21% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Founder, Charles Liang, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$13m worth of shares at a price of US$252 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$714. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.9% of Charles Liang's holding.\n\nAll up, insiders sold more shares in Super Micro Computer than they bought, over the last year. The sellers received a price of around US$303, on average. It's not too encouraging to see that insiders have sold at below the current price. But we wouldn't put too much weight on the insider selling. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nInsiders At Super Micro Computer Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Super Micro Computer. We note insiders cashed in US$6.6m worth of shares. On the other hand we note insider Shiu Chan bought US$1.1m worth of shares. We don't view these transactions as a positive sign.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Super Micro Computer insiders own 14% of the company, worth about US$6.0b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Super Micro Computer Insiders?\n\nThe insider sales have outweighed the insider buying, at Super Micro Computer, in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. On the plus side, Super Micro Computer makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To help with this, we've discovered 4 warning signs (2 are a bit concerning!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Super Micro Computer.\n\nOf course Super Micro Computer may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Can You Afford to Ignore These 3 Stocks Up Over 200% in 2024?",
        "content": "Buying stocks up over 200% in 2024 is a tricky proposition. On one hand, you don\u2019t want to fight momentum. Plenty of shorts have been burned trying to time a reversal in momentum for hot stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and even former meme stock megalith Gamestop (NYSE:GME). Likewise, plenty of bulls have gotten cut trying to catch a falling knife, hoping for a resurgence. Still, determining which stocks will keep pumping and which \u2014 like Gamestop \u2014 are a dumpster fire is tough.\n\nEach of these three stocks, up over 200% in 2024, slashes that opposing sentiment, though. All have bullish tailwinds propelling them higher, with unique factors helping buffer against wider market meltdowns. In other words, it may not be too late to ride the momentum even higher despite their existing 200%+ surge thus far.\n\nMediaCo Holding (MDIA) Radio microphone in a soundproofed room with an \"on air\" sign in the background.\n\nSource: radioshoot/ShutterStock.com\n\nMediaCo Holding (NASDAQ:MDIA) is a terrestrial radio and broadcasting media stock \u2014 not something you\u2019d think would surge more than 200% ever, let alone in just a few short months. But, bucking expectations, this stock surged 361% since January 1st.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA fair amount of MediaCo\u2019s recent gains came on the heels of an announcement that hedge fund Standard General LP snagged a sizeable 95% stake in the firm. Bordering on full-blown acquisition territory, the move telegraphed two messages to investors. First, hedge fund CEO Soohyung Kim is betting big on MediaCo\u2019s future, and second, we can expect some degree of activism from Kim to push per-share pricing higher.\n\nThat shareholder activism may already be bearing fruit, as the company just announced a major acquisition of Estrella Media, diversifying MediaCo\u2019s presence further into Spanish-language demographics and markets. Better yet, new interim CEO Jacqueline Hernandez is a former Telemundo exec who understands what that market needs and how to target it. Massive initial gains in 2024 may be just the beginning for this stock already up over 200%.\n\nRoot (ROOT) A close-up shot of a hand choosing wooden blocks with emoticons related to health insurance. russell 2000 stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRoot (NASDAQ:ROOT) is blowing past our 200% gain benchmark. This stock has already returned nearly twice that in 2024. Root\u2019s stock is soaring because of continued AI enthusiasm and a shockingly strong fourth-quarter earnings report. Root is a digital insurance provider targeting auto owners, renters and homeowners that leverages AI to analyze potential clients and gather real-time driving data to optimize premium management and reduce loss risks.\n\nIn 2023, Root reported a 31% increase in gross written premiums to $783 million, although gross earned premiums dropped 1% to $636 million. The company also halved its net losses to $147 million, marking its best year ever. Analysts swarmed the stock following the breakout, with Jefferies setting the stage by quadrupling its price target and saying the company is \u201csetting a path to profitable growth, market share gains and scalability for a viable business model.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market rewarded Root\u2019s efforts, with its stock climbing 400% since January and a staggering 1,127% over the past year. Though still trudging along a path toward profitability, Root is making significant progress.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) may lag slightly behind our other stocks, but the AI-driven stock has popped more than 225% since January. SMCI capitalizes on its role in the ever-expanding artificial intelligence sector but also seems to have greater upside potential even as AI\u2019s top stocks lose steam. The company supplies server-sized computing solutions and counts major players like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) among its clients.\n\nFundamentally, Super Micro Computer exemplifies the idea that the most promising semiconductor and AI investment opportunities may reside with upstream suppliers \u2014 those providing \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d \u2014 rather than with end-user companies facing intense competition within the sector.\n\nThis is evident when comparing the company\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio of \u201cjust\u201d 66x against Nvidia\u2019s 97x. While not direct comparisons, this disparity suggests that, despite a 200% increase, Super Micro Computer is slightly undervalued compared to one of its major downstream clients that\u2019s captured the lion\u2019s share of wider AI exuberance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia and Intel: This Stock Could Be the Biggest Winner of Their New Chip Launches",
        "content": "Nvidia and Intel have both announced big news in recent weeks -- news that could result in rising revenue from artificial intelligence (AI) customers. Nvidia, the world's biggest AI chip company, plans to launch its Blackwell architecture along with its highest-performance chip ever later this year. And Intel will bring its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerator -- one that it says can outperform Nvidia's current chip H100 -- to the market in the coming months.\n\nNvidia's new products and services could ensure its leadership position, helping it hold onto its 80% AI chip market share. And Intel's Gaudi 3 may help it gain ground after falling behind earlier in the AI race. But the biggest winner of these major AI chip launches actually may be another company. This player benefits from demand for its own products as well as demand for the most popular chips, and that's helped earnings and share price to skyrocket in recent times.\n\nLet's take a closer look at this AI stock that could continue to roar higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI servers and workstations\n\nIt's important to remember that, often, customers look to buy AI chips as part of a bigger system, such as a server or workstation. And for this, many turn to Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), a leader in the field. Supermicro has been around for 30 years but saw its business take off only over the past few years, thanks to demand from AI customers for its products.\n\nThe company recently reported its first $3 billion quarter -- that's more than an entire year of revenue -- back in 2021. Supermicro said it's seeing ongoing record demand for AI systems at rack scale, including the latest chips from Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices. Due to this momentum, Supermicro's full-year revenue forecast of at least $14.3 billion implies more than 100% growth year over year. Chief executive officer Charles Liang says we may be facing \"an AI revolution\" and says that high demand could continue for years.\n\nSpecifically, Supermicro is benefiting from new product launches from Nvidia, Intel, and others. The equipment maker works hand-in-hand with these companies, following their innovations and launch schedules so it can quickly make those latest features available within its systems. At the same time, Supermicro's building blocks method, which uses common elements throughout its platforms, also supports the idea of speed.\n\nAll of this means that when Nvidia or a rival launches a new chip, Supermicro can offer its platforms with that chip pretty quickly.\n\nTop chip launches\n\nI said earlier that Supermicro may benefit even more from the upcoming launches than Nvidia and Intel. That's because these companies only generate growth through the sales of their own new products -- but Supermicro may see more demand and revenue growth through all of the top chip companies' product launches. Considering that each chip designer is working hard to keep its market position or grow, and that means frequently releasing new chips, growth in demand for Supermicro's systems that include these innovations may be far from over.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, should you really forget Nvidia and Intel? Not necessarily. These chip leaders still represent solid buys today. But the advantage of Supermicro is it doesn't rely on the future of one chip company alone. The company's earnings will benefit regardless of whether Nvidia stays in the lead or Intel gains market share.\n\nAs a result, Supermicro allows you to bet on overall demand for AI chips and systems, and this could score a win for your portfolio over time. After all, the AI market is forecast to reach more than $1 trillion by 2030, so this growth story may just be getting started.\n\nNow let's consider valuation. Supermicro trades at a premium to Nvidia and Intel in relation to forward earnings estimates. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nI think Supermicro is worth this premium since it benefits from general chip demand, regardless of which chip company is in the lead -- and this makes it lower-risk than the chip companies. At the same time, Supermicro's special features like systems tailored to a customer's needs and its own liquid-cooling technology should keep orders flowing in as well.\n\nSo, yes, Nvidia and Intel are buys. But Supermicro may be an even better buy right now as it's set to win from its own innovations -- and the ones of others.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why Nvidia Stock Plunged 10% Today",
        "content": "It's rare for a $2 trillion stock to fall on no direct news, but that's exactly what happened to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) today.\n\nShares of the AI chip leader got swept up in a broader AI sell-off after one analyst noted that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), another AI stock leader, failed to report preliminary revenue, casting doubt on its upcoming results.\n\nThat news caused Nvidia to fall 10%, while Supermicro lost 23.1% today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI momentum shifts\n\nUp until this month, AI stocks had skyrocketed this year on blowout growth and excitement for the breakthrough technology. At one point, Nvidia stock had nearly doubled year to date, following another blockbuster earnings report in February, and its market cap topped $2 trillion.\n\nHowever, as this week's sell-off indicates, much of those gains were primarily driven by sentiment and a fear of missing out (FOMO) on the AI boom.\n\nWhen stocks have already made gains of several hundred percent like Nvidia and Supermicro have, it doesn't take much for those gains to unwind, and that seems to be what's happening here.\n\nA negative piece of news causes a little bit of selling, which leads to a flood as investors race to lock in profits before a potential bubble burst.\n\nIs Nvidia stock in trouble?\n\nThe observation that drove the sell-off could easily be a nonevent, as a Wells Fargo analyst noted that Supermicro did not give its customary preliminary revenue report, possibly implying that its quarterly results were weaker than expected.\n\nThat's entirely speculation, however, Investors should also be aware that an event like that wouldn't normally cause a stock to plunge 23% like Supermicro did, but it has been highly volatile and propped up in part by momentum and sentiment.\n\nAs far as Nvidia is concerned, the GPU maker is a close partner of Supermicro, but Nvidia is much larger, meaning it's not particularly sensitive to Supermicro's results.\n\nStill, sentiment in the AI sector tends to move these stocks in unison, and Nvidia has also benefited from enthusiasm and high expectations for AI, so it's not surprising to see the stock falling in line with Supermicro.\n\nIt's too soon to know if today's sell-off is meaningful. Keep an eye on Supermicro's Q3 earnings report, which is due out after hours on April 30, as that will confirm or reverse today's sell-off. Expect Nvidia to move in tandem with Super Micro Computer after that news comes out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why Arm Holdings Stock Plunged Today",
        "content": "Shares of Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) were taking a dive today, getting hit for the third day in a row on disappointing news on the artificial intelligence (AI) front.\n\nAfter ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing both fell on their earnings reports on Wednesday and Thursday, dragging down Arm and other AI stocks, today Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) shares plunged after one analyst observed that the company failed to pre-report revenue, which had become a pattern for it in earlier reports.\n\nAs of 3:18 p.m. ET, shares of Arm were down 14.5%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs the AI bubble bursting?\n\nThe AI bubble may not be bursting, but it is clearly deflating, as stocks like Super Micro Computer and Arm are now down sharply from their peaks earlier this year, even though there hasn't been a clear indication that momentum in the AI sector is slowing.\n\nASML, the leading semiconductor manufacturing stock, is in the middle of a transition to new technologies; TSMC reported strong growth in high-performance computing, a proxy for AI, but cited weakness in the smartphone market, and it's unclear if the lack of a preliminary report at Supermicro, as that company is also known, is meaningful.\n\nHowever, altogether the news shows that AI momentum isn't enough to take over the semiconductor sector, as these stocks are still sensitive to broader tech trends, including weak demand for consumer devices like smartphones and PCs.\n\nWhat it means for Arm\n\nArm stock is now down nearly 50% from its peak in February, as the stock was trading at a sky-high price-to-sales ratio, which was roughly 50 at one point. In addition, its float is relatively low, which increases volatility, as around 90% of the stock is held by Softbank.\n\nHowever, price-to-sales may not be the best way to judge Arm stock, as it is highly profitable. On a forward P/E basis, it's expensive at around 75 right now, but the company has a number of competitive advantages that led to its surge earlier this year, and its revenue growth is accelerating on AI-related demand.\n\nThere's no doubt this has been a frustrating week for Arm shareholders, and the AI sector more broadly, but there's no material reason to sell based on the pullback. We'll learn more once earnings reports start rolling in.\n\nKeep an eye on Supermicro's upcoming update, which is scheduled for April 30, and Arm's should come out sometime in May.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Stock Tanked Friday. Is It Time to Sell?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has been riding the artificial intelligence (AI) wave that Nvidia started. That makes sense to some extent. Super Micro provides the computer stacks for data centers that run the AI content powered by Nvidia's chips and software.\n\nBut Super Micro stock plunged more than 20% today, as of late Friday afternoon trading. Even so, the stock has soared by more than 150% so far this year. So investors might be wondering whether it's time to take those profits, or if today's plunge means the stock is now a bargain.\n\nSuper Micro is not Nvidia\n\nToday's stock drop may have occurred for an interesting reason. The company didn't provide investors any news -- that is, except for the news release that told investors that Super Micro would be reporting its fiscal 2024 third-quarter earnings on April 30. But what was interesting was that was the only news release.\n\nIn seven of the past eight quarterly periods, the AI hardware company has also preannounced its financial results, mostly to prepare investors for a better-than-expected report. Now investors fear that the upcoming report won't include a positive earnings surprise.\n\nSuper Micro previously told investors to expect revenue of between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion for the quarter. The Wall Street consensus is for sales of about $4 billion and earnings of $5.84 a share. That compares to sales of about $3.7 billion and net income per common share of $5.10 in its prior fiscal second quarter.\n\nBut investors have been expecting more, as shares have more than doubled in just the past three months. That said, Super Micro wasn't going to ride Nvidia's AI coattails forever. Even as sales have surged with the boost from data center growth, Super Micro reported a gross profit margin of just 15.4% in its most recent quarterly report, down from 16.7% in the prior-year period. Its products are more of a commodity than Nvidia's difficult-to-get chips.\n\nToday's drop implies investors may be thinking this will be the quarterly report where that will become more apparent.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Recently red-hot Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock -- up 765% over the last 52 weeks -- turned ice cold Friday, falling 17.2% through 11:20 a.m. ET. And believe it or not, Wells Fargo is to blame.\n\nThis morning the bank reiterated its equal weight (i.e., hold) rating on the popular artificial intelligence (AI) stock, saying it thinks the shares are worth $960. Considering the stock closed at $928 Thursday evening, that doesn't sound so bad... except for one thing.\n\nOne bad thing about Supermicro stock\n\nSuper Micro Computer announced this morning that it will report its fiscal third-quarter 2024 earnings on Tuesday, April 30. Now, here's the thing: Seven of the last eight times Super Micro has announced an upcoming earnings report, says Wells Fargo, the company paired this news with a preannouncement of better-than-expected earnings.\n\nThat didn't happen this time.\n\nAll Supermicro said is that the earnings would be released, and not that they would be good earnings. And in Wells' view, this should be \"considered a negative, important AI data point.\"\n\nHow scared should investors be?\n\nNow, there's no need to panic. As Wells Fargo pointed out in its note on StreetInsider this morning, the single time (out of the last eight times) that Supermicro phrased an earnings announcement this way, it did at least announce \"in line\" earnings, basically matching its prior guidance. Assuming the same holds true this time around, that probably means investors can rest assured Q3 sales will still come in within the $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion range that management previously promised, and that earnings will still fall somewhere between $4.79 and $5.64 per share.\n\nStill, when you consider that most analysts are expecting Supermicro to earn $5.84 per share this quarter, this does raise the risk that the company might miss at least the analysts' earnings number. And that alone could be enough to hurt the stock.\n\nThat's the risk you take when investing in a stock that costs 72 times earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Could Super Micro Computer Become the Next Dell Technologies?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), more commonly known as Supermicro, saw its shares skyrocket by 2,380% over the past three years. The server maker was also added to the S&P 500 this March and has a market cap of $57 billion.\n\nYet Supermicro is still less valuable than its rival Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL), which has a market cap of $86 billion, currently leads the server market, and is expected to generate more than 6 times as much revenue as Supermicro in its current fiscal year.\n\nSo could Supermicro catch up to Dell and eclipse its market cap in the near future? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy is Supermicro growing faster than Dell?\n\nSupermicro and Dell both produce servers, but they operate different business models. Supermicro mainly sells high-performance servers, and its close relationship with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's top-tier data center GPUs before many of its larger competitors.\n\nSupermicro's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last August) as the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market drove more companies to ramp up their purchases of its dedicated AI servers. At the end of fiscal 2023, Supermicro said it generated roughly half of its revenue from its AI servers.\n\nFrom fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this February), Dell's revenue declined at a CAGR of negative 2%. Its growth stalled out because it still generated most of its revenue from PCs, data storage devices, and legacy servers. Its PC sales slowed as pandemic pressures eased while rising rates and other macro headwinds curbed its sales of storage devices and legacy servers. Unlike Supermicro, Dell doesn't disclose the exact percentage of its revenue that comes from AI servers.\n\nSupermicro only controls about 7% of the server market, according to Barclays, while Dell remains the clear leader with a high-teens share. But Supermicro also controls 10% of the niche AI server market, according to Bank of America, and that figure could climb to 17% within the next three years.\n\nCould Supermicro become bigger than Dell?\n\nGlobal Market Insights expects the entire AI server market to expand at a CAGR of 18% from 2024 to 2032. So if Supermicro keeps pace with the market's growth, maintains its tight relationship with Nvidia, rolls out new AI servers powered by Advanced Micro Devices' new data center GPUs, and continues to expand its share of the AI server market, it could generate much bigger gains than Dell over the next decade.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Supermicro's revenue to rise at a CAGR of 46% from $7.1 billion to $22.1 billion as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 41%. If you believe it can hit those rosy targets, then its stock still looks reasonably valued at 32 times next year's earnings and 2.5 times next year's sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy comparison, Dell has set a conservative long-term goal of growing its annual revenue by 3% to 4% and its EPS by at least 8% every year. It expects that steady growth to be driven by the stabilization of the PC market, its higher sales of AI servers, and the recovery of its data storage solutions business in a warmer macro environment.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Dell's revenue to increase at a CAGR of 5.5% from $88.4 billion to $104 billion as its EPS grows at a CAGR of 7%. Dell trades at just 16 times its forward adjusted earnings and 1 time next year's sales, making it seem cheaper than Supermicro, but it arguably deserves those lower valuations.\n\nAssuming both companies' valuations hold steady, Supermicro's market cap won't come anywhere close to eclipsing Dell's within the next three years. It should also still control a smaller slice of the server market than Dell. Therefore, you can't call Supermicro the \"next Dell\" yet -- but this growing underdog could generate much bigger gains than its larger competitor over the next few years as the AI server market expands.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Continue to Soar in 2024: My Top 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before the Surge Continues",
        "content": "After enduring one of its worst performances since 2008, the Nasdaq Composite has turned things around, gaining 50% since the beginning of last year. After such a sharp move higher, some investors wonder if much upside remains.\n\nYet a review of the data suggests the current market rally still has room to run. Since the storied index began trading back in 1972, every year after a market recovery begins, the tech-heavy index has risen 19%, on average. The ongoing battle with inflation is a wild card that could still throw a wrench in the works. That said, history suggests that 2024 should be a profitable year for investors.\n\nIt's generally agreed that recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have helped fuel the market's ascent and will likely drive additional gains in 2024. While estimates vary, generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years, according to data compiled by McKinsey Global Institute. Companies at the cutting edge of AI will enjoy a veritable windfall.\n\nHere are my top five AI stocks to buy before the Nasdaq climbs to new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNo discussion regarding the potential for AI would be complete without a nod to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) is the gold standard for several AI use cases, including machine learning, cloud computing, and data centers -- and its processors have quickly become the go-to for generative AI. Demand has far exceeded supply, with the resulting chip shortage expected to persist until 2025. Competition is fierce, but Nvidia's decades of experience and significant spending on research and development have kept its rivals at bay.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) grew 126% and 586%, respectively. While no one expects its triple-digit gains to continue indefinitely, demand is expected to remain strong. Furthermore, while 34 times forward earnings might seem pricey, its growth illustrates why Nvida is deserving of a premium.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) was another company that was quick to capitalize on the generative AI opportunity. After years of toiling behind the scenes, it took a $13 billion stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and rolled out its Copilot suite of AI assistants. Copilot is deeply integrated into Microsoft's core offerings, streamlining time-consuming tasks and making workers more productive. A survey of early users found that once they tried Copilot, 77% said they \"didn't want to give it up.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNew versions are still being introduced. While estimates vary, some analysts believe Copilot could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue annually, which will be a boon to the company. Furthermore, Microsoft's Azure Cloud is gaining market share and attributing its accelerating growth to AI. At 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft is selling for a premium compared to a multiple of 27 for the S&P 500, but that's pretty reasonable considering Microsoft's potential.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has been laboring in the field for more than 20 years, supplying AI-fueled data analytics to governments and enterprises alike. When AI went viral last year, the company met the challenge head-on, introducing its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which layers generative AI onto its already robust offerings.\n\nPalantir offers \"boot camps\" to identify mission-critical issues it can solve with AIP, and demand has been off the charts. The company planned to host 500 sessions in one year and blew past the goal in just four months. As a result, Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue jumped 70% year over year and 12% sequentially, making it the company's fastest-growing business, and it's only just getting started.\n\nPalantir's forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\n4. Super Micro Computer\n\nIt isn't just chips and software that are fueling the AI revolution. Most AI processing happens on cloud or data center servers, and that's where Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, comes in. The company works closely with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and others to develop cutting-edge servers that can withstand the rigors of AI processing. These close ties ensure that Supermicro servers are optimized to be AI workhorses while also focusing on energy efficiency.\n\nDemand is strong and the company is taking market share from its rivals. In its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), revenue grew 103% year over year while its adjusted EPS jumped 71%. Yet despite its impressive growth, Supermicro is selling for less than 3 times forward sales, a bargain when considered in the light of its opportunity.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has a long history of deploying AI to boost its search and digital advertising businesses. The company quickly deployed generative AI functionality into its core Google and Android products. Furthermore, the company is well positioned to offer generative AI models to its cloud customers via Google Cloud, the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider.\n\nOne of its biggest opportunities is Gemini, which the company says is its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Furthermore, Google's Vertex AI platform provides 130 foundational models that help users build and deploy generative AI apps without having to reinvent the wheel.\n\nRecent advancements in AI will likely help fuel the recovery in Google's digital advertising business, and at less than 27 times earnings, Alphabet stock is a steal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Superb Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 63% and 70%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "The past year or so has marked a coming-of-age story for artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI's ability to generate original content and streamline time-consuming processes represents a potential step change in how business gets done. The opportunity to profit from the productivity gains made possible by these next-generation algorithms has many companies scrambling to determine how best to integrate them into their day-to-day operations.\n\nDespite generating market-beating performances in 2023, some market watchers believe there's more to come for AI stocks. In fact, a pair of Wall Street analysts suggest two still have potential upside of 63% and 70% over the coming year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence buy No. 1: Nvidia -- 63% implied upside\n\nIf there is one stock that exemplifies the potential represented by recent advancements in AI, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) would certainly be in the running. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) use parallel processing, the ability to process a magnitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously by breaking the data into smaller chunks to make it more manageable. This not only revolutionized gaming but also enabled the evolution of AI.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia delivered revenue that grew 126% year over year to roughly $61 billion, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared 586% to $11.93. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ends April 30), Nvidia is guiding for record revenue of $24 billion, an increase of 234% year over year. Management left no doubt that the accelerating demand for generative AI was behind the surge.\n\nDespite the stock rising 488% since the start of 2023 (as of this writing), Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann, the self-professed \"most bullish analyst on Nvidia,\" has a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $1,400 on the stock. That represents potential upside of 63% compared to Monday's closing price. Mosesmann said, \"The shift to accelerated compute away from general compute is reaching a tipping point, and a disruptive new app, generative AI, is creating a whole new industry.\"\n\nThe analyst isn't alone in his bullish take. Of the 56 analysts who issued an opinion in March, 52 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and not one recommended selling. That's amazing, considering Wall Street never agrees on anything.\n\nNvidia stock is currently selling for 34 times forward earnings. While that's a premium to the multiple of 27 for the S&P 500, the company's triple-digit growth and strong tailwinds suggest it's worthy of a premium.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence buy No. 2: Super Micro Computer -- 70% implied upside\n\nWhile Nvidia provides the GPUs necessary to train and run AI systems, Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, incorporates these state-of-the-art chips and others into high-end servers specially designed to withstand the rigors of AI processing.\n\nThe company's focus on energy efficiency is well-documented, as is its building-block architecture. Supermicro offers a variety of free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air-cooling technologies, providing AI-centric server solutions for every budget and technology level.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter, Supermicro generated revenue that grew 103% year over year to roughly $3.7 billion, while its adjusted EPS jumped 71% to $5.59.\u00a0And management believes the company's growth spurt will continue to accelerate. Supermicro is forecasting third-quarter revenue of $3.9 billion and EPS of $5.22 at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent year-over-year growth of 205% and 220%, respectively.\n\nThe stock is up an incredible 975% since the start of 2023, but some believe significant upside remains. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $1,500 on the stock. That represents potential upside of 70% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nBaruah is increasingly confident in Supermicro's position in the generative AI server space and its leadership in addressing the increasing complexity and scale of the server industry. Furthermore, he believes the company can achieve a revenue run rate of $40 billion by the end of its fiscal 2026. For context, that runs circles around the $7.1 billion it generated in its fiscal 2023 (ended Jun. 30).\n\nThe analyst isn't alone in his bullish take. Of the 15 analysts who covered the stock in March, 11 rated it a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling. Supermicro stock is also attractively priced, currently selling for 3 times forward sales.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Could Super Micro Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is arguably one of the more surprising successes of the current boom in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. The manufacturer of servers existed in relative obscurity for decades despite expanding its operations to more than 100 countries.\n\nHowever, a partnership with Nvidia has stoked demand for its servers as customers seek the hardware for running AI applications. Consequently, the stock has risen more than 2,000% in the last three years.\n\nWith those gains, investors who have held the stock for three years or more have a likely path to millionaire status even if they started with relatively small investments. What is less clear is whether small investors can expect to become millionaires by starting now.\n\nThe state of Super Micro\n\nSuper Micro has existed since 1993. The company committed to its role as a rack-scale, total IT solutions provider, building energy-efficient and environmentally friendly servers for its customers.\n\nSince its founding, the company has become an innovator in the server industry. It also expanded steadily, establishing operations in Asia and Europe in the 1990s. That expansion enabled the launch of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2007. Nonetheless, between its 2007 IPO and the end of 2021, the stock had appreciated less than 400%.\n\nHowever, its servers became increasingly popular in this decade, and the sudden interest in generative AI sent its stock into the stratosphere. SMCI Chart\n\nThe bull market in these investments may not end anytime soon. Allied Market Research projects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38% for the AI chip industry through 2028. Thus, even if growth slows after 2028, it is likely that Super Micro will be at the center of a much larger industry years from now.\n\nSuper Micro's financials and metrics\n\nOne can see that trend in the increase in Super Micro stock. A $10,000 investment three years ago would be worth just under $240,000 today. This means it has doubled in value more than four times over that time. At that value, shares would only have to double just over two more times to reach $1 million. Hence, those holding long-term positions in Super Micro can become millionaires even if they started small.\n\nStill, those who buy now will probably have to take larger positions. Here's why.\n\nIts market cap, which was only about $2 billion three years ago, has now reached $52 billion. If you invested $10,000 at today's price, the market cap will have to rise to $5.2 trillion to make that a $1 million investment.\n\nNeedless to say, such a market-cap level would take considerable industry growth. Its partner Nvidia, which leads the industry segment that has taken Super Micro higher, has a market cap of around $2.25 trillion, about 43 times Super Micro's size.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile both companies should continue to grow long term, it would take an almost unimaginable amount of growth to take Super Micro's market cap to $5.2 trillion and beyond, a factor calling for some perspective when it comes to Super Micro's \"millionaire-maker\" status.\n\nInvesting in Super Micro\n\nToday's small investors are unlikely to become millionaires from Super Micro stock. Indeed, the company has experienced massive growth amid a partnership with Nvidia.\n\nNonetheless, the more recent increases have taken Super Micro's market cap into large-cap status. Also, with that gain, it is less than 3% of Nvidia's current size. Since Super Micro would have to grow to more than 2.4 times Nvidia's size to make small investors millionaires, investors should not expect such results.\n\nStill, this does not necessarily mean investors should write off Super Micro stock. Considering the popularity of AI and anticipated growth for the industry, investors can still become significantly richer in Super Micro regardless of where they start.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Despite being inherently volatile, there are no shortages of tech stocks with long-term potential in the market. Technology is constantly evolving, after all. We only have to look at Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) as recent examples.\n\nThe question, then, is how to choose tech stocks to hold long-term. Looking back on my investing career, which started in 1996, I find myself with a portfolio containing stocks that I\u2019ve held for more than a decade. And yes, research is typically the best way to find such companies. However, I understand not everyone has the time to get into the nitty-gritty.\n\nThankfully, I know a few relevant categories to filter tech companies with good growth potential, strong financial performance, and a clear vision of their future. Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo come up with a shortlist of stocks, I screened for stocks with:\n\nNet income growth comparison from four years ago (above 30%) Analyst ratings (Strong Buy only)  One-year positive EPS growth\n\nThese metrics give me a good indication of how these companies might perform in the future. However, nothing is set in stone, and past performance does not equate to future results (even though that\u2019s how investment advisors sell their products.)\n\nRambus (RMBS) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne tech stock on my radar is the semiconductor company Rambus Inc. (NASDAQ:RMBS). The company\u2019s business portfolio is quite diverse, and it produces different types of tech products with all sorts of practical applications in the present and the future, contributing to its overall long-term potential.\n\nThe company\u2019s productions include:\n\nMemory interface chips (DDR5 and DDR4) are sold to module manufacturers, OEMs, and hyperscalers. Silicon IP solutions for data movement and protection in advanced applications across data centers, government, and more. Security IP solutions include hardware roots of trust, high-speed protocol engines, provisioning technologies, and a patent portfolio covering memory architecture, high-speed serial links, etc.\n\nRambus has recently launched a $50 million accelerated share repurchase program with the Royal Bank of Canada, which shows its confidence in its long-term growth strategy.\n\nThe company will receive an initial delivery of approximately 675,000 shares, with the final number determined by the average price during the transaction. The program is expected to conclude by the end of this year\u2019s Q1.\n\nAside from repurchasing shares, Rambus\u2019 FY23 report showed relatively decent improvements across key metrics. Revenue reached $461.1 million, increasing from $454.8 million last year. The bottom line is even more impressive\u2014 $3.01 per diluted share, as opposed to negative 13 cents per share last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nRambus also registered a 42.76% 4-year net income growth rate. Given their perfect \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendation, analysts consider RMBS one of the more attractive long-term tech stocks.\n\nOSI Systems (OSIS) biotech stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother tech stocks worth your attention is OSI Systems (NASDAQ:OSIS). The company has been doing a pretty good job establishing market dominance with its multiple business segments, as evidenced by its four-year net income growth of 322.45%.\n\nOSI Sytems\u2019 main segments are:\n\nSecurity (Rapiscan and S2): Offers inspection systems for baggage, parcels, cargo, and vehicles, as well as people screening, radiation monitoring, and explosive detection, along with related services. Healthcare (Spacelabs): Provides patient monitoring, cardiology, and other solutions for medical settings. Optoelectronics: Supplies optoelectronic devices, electronics manufacturing services, LCD displays, and flex circuits to industries like aerospace, defense, and more.\n\nWhen it comes to the company\u2019s business segments, OSI Systems\u2019 security division recently secured an international deal worth $100 million. This contract aims to provide cargo and vehicle inspection systems and maintenance services\u2014a global commitment to enhancing security measures.\n\nThe company\u2019s Q2\u201924 financial report easily proves my description of a tech stock \u201cworthy of one\u2019s attention.\u201d Q2\u201924 revenue increased by 26% to $373 million year over year, and operating income increased by 105% in the same period.\n\nLooking at these financial metrics alone, I feel that analysts\u2019 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating for the stock is quite deserved.\n\nLiveramp (RAMP) illustration the LiveRamp Holdings logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn this list, LiveRamp Holdings (NYSE:RAMP) currently has the highest net income growth compared to four years ago, clocking in at 4,280.54%.\n\nThe company provides a data collaboration platform to help organizations unify customer and prospect data while protecting consumer privacy. It also supports various people-based marketing solutions, including data collaboration, activation, measurement, and more. LiveRamp sells its solutions to financial services, retail, automotive, telecommunications, healthcare, travel, etc.\n\nSpeaking of data platforms, LiveRamp recently launched its unified Data Collaboration Platform that features Composable Technology. This platform aims to streamline the marketing lifecycle on a single platform.\n\nAccording to the report, the platform has a simplified user interface, composable tech for cross-cloud interoperability, and a marketplace for third-party developers.\n\nOn the financial side, LiveRamp reported Q3\u201924 results with considerable YOY growth. Total revenue increased 9.6% to $173.9 million.

        "content": "Server manufacturer Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) was added to the S&P 500 index earlier this year. While the company has been operating for decades, soaring demand for servers capable of running artificial intelligence workloads has propelled Super Micro's revenues and profits to new heights.\n\nAnalysts at Loop Capital see the inclusion in the S&P 500 index as a reason to get behind Super Micro's pricey valuation. Loop Capital maintained its \"buy\" rating on the stock on Tuesday while boosting its price target from $600 to $1,500. Based on this new price target, Super Micro stock has a 70% upside.\n\nOn its way to $40 billion in revenue\n\nLoop Capital expects Super Micro to exit fiscal 2026 with a $40 billion annual revenue run rate. The company generated $3.66 billion in revenue during its most recent quarter, which puts its annual revenue run rate just shy of $15 billion today.\n\nLoop Capital also believes that Super Micro can trade for somewhere between 20 and 30 times earnings going forward, justifying that view by pointing to the stock's inclusion in the S&P 500. The consensus analyst estimate calls for Super Micro to produce adjusted earnings per share of $22.10 in the current fiscal year.\n\nIs Super Micro stock a buy?\n\nHere's the big question: How sustainable are Super Micro's profits? The company operates in a low-margin industry: Gross margin hovers in the mid-teens, and it's been declining in recent quarters.\n\nAs the market for AI servers explodes, competition is almost guaranteed to intensify from both direct competitors and cloud companies designing their own systems.

        "content": "In this article, we will look into the 30 largest stock exchanges in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to the 10 Largest Stock Exchanges in the World.\n\nGlobal Stock Market Outlook 2024 and Top Performers\n\nAccording to the April issue of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global stock market valuation, defined as the market cap of all listed companies across the globe, reached $111.85 trillion in February 2024, recording a moderate growth of 1.48%. As of February 2024, there are 54,625 total domestic and foreign listed companies in the global stock market. In February, trading activity showed strong growth, with the number of trades reaching over 4.34 trillion.\n\nOn April 1, Forbes reported that the US stock market experienced a strong first quarter in 2024. In March, the S&P 500 recorded total returns of 3.2%, driven by the positive outlook of the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average grew by 6.1% and NASDAQ grew by over 9.3% in the first quarter of 2024. Sectors including technology, consumer cyclical, and consumer defensive fueled the market growth in the first quarter, generating total returns of over 8% or more, each.\n\nAmong the best-performing S&P 500 stocks for the quarter, the leading AI server manufacturing company, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) exhibited strong performance and led the market by a substantial margin, recording a 255% year-to-date increase. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) has recorded a noteworthy return of 502% since the start of 2023. Another leading company manufacturing AI chips, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has maintained its strong growth in 2024 so far, after being the top-performing S&P 500 stock of 2023. The company's market cap reached $2.29 trillion in the first quarter of 2024. This can be attributed to a year-to-date surge of 82% and a 321% increase since the beginning of 2023 in NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are also among the 10 unstoppable tech stocks to buy now.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making huge moves in AI and investors and analysts are bullish on the stock. Over the past 3 months, the stock has received 39 Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Its average price target of $989.5 represents an upside of 15% from current levels. As of April 5, the stock has returned over 215% over the past 12 months. Here is what Palm Valley Capital Fund said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cSuch beguiling prognostications are indigenous to Wall Street\u2014the biggest showcase of them all. The ferocious march higher of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s stock on expectations of its continued dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) chips might even confound the galley slavedriver in Ben-Hur. Ramming speed!\n\nNvidia\u2019s share price seems to imply the firm will soon control nearly the entire global semiconductor market (over half a trillion in sales vs. Nvidia\u2019s current $60 billion) while maintaining an operating margin of 54%\u2014unprecedented for a hardware company. Leading hardware firms rarely retain their supremacy forever: IBM, Hewlett Packard, Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel, and Cisco all fell from their storied perches\u2026\u201d\n\nAnalysts are also bullish on Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). On March 25, Northland Capital Markets analyst Nehal Chokshi raised the price target on Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) to $1,300 from $925 and maintained an Outperform rating. Over the past 3 months, the stock has received 7 Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Here is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile large cap benchmarks get a lot of attention for a handful of mega cap stocks driving the lion\u2019s share of performance, we would highlight even more extreme and unprecedented concentration in small cap benchmarks. Year to date, one stock, Super Micro Computer, Inc.(NASDAQ:SMCI)\u00a0has driven 37% of the return of the benchmark.\n\nCurrently, SMCI is the largest constituent by weight in our benchmark, and it peaked at over 4.5%, representing the largest individual security weight in a monthly dataset going back to 1985. That represented a weighting 83% higher than the second-largest weight (from 1999). Moreover, MicroStrategy at its peak this past quarter would have represented the fourth-largest security in the 38 years of the monthly dataset. We are hard-pressed to recall another instance where the largest constituent of our benchmark was also added to the S&P 500, as SMCI was this March. We would note that SMCI currently is a $61 billion market capitalization company and MicroStrategy boasts a market capitalization of $28 billion, both well above the $6.8 billion weighted average market cap of the Strategy.\n\nEnthusiasm for AI and bitcoin have fueled this atypical concentration and performance distortion. Bitcoin rallied fast and furiously following the SEC\u2019s approval of the first bitcoin ETF in early January, while the AI infrastructure build-out has had a narrow set of beneficiaries. Against this backdrop, the ClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy underperformed its benchmark. We are disappointed by this result, although 79% of the relative underperformance was due to not owning these two large benchmark holdings, which have fundamental and governance factors that have caused us, as long-term investors focused on quality sustainable growth stories, to avoid them.\u201d\n\nYou can also look at the 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket and 11 Stocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution.\n\nEuropean Stocks Tumble After Strong Q1\n\nOn April 5, Reuters reported that the European market witnessed a significant decline after a strong first quarter, amid hawkish comments from a US Federal Reserve official, reversing the bullish sentiment that led to gains in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOn April 4, Minneapolis Fed President, Neel Kashkari appeared at a virtual LinkedIn event where he was asked about the expected rate cuts in 2024. The Federal Reserve official expressed his shock over the economy's resilience despite the rising interest rates. He further added that with significant growth in the job market, GDP, and consumer spending, we might not need to cut rates. He said:\n\n\"Maybe the dynamics that we have right now are actually sustainable. But, you know, there are a lot of ifs underlying that question and that hypothesis or that scenario that I just articulated. So we need to see what ultimately happens with both the labor market and with inflation. Our dual mandate ultimately is what drives our rate path.\"\n\nThe idea floated by the Fed official doused hopes for interest rate cuts and led to the stumbling of European stocks on April 5. The STOXX Europe 600 (.STOXX) declined 1.2% and reached its lowest since mid-October 2023. Benchmark indices across the major European countries including DAX Performance Index, FTSE MIB Index (.FTMIB), and IBEX 35 (.IBEX), declined by over 1% each.\n\nThe drop can also be attributed to the ongoing Middle East crisis. The increase in Brent crude prices and the suspicions regarding supply disruption, led to a 1.8% drop in the travel and leisure stocks, the STOXX 600 Travel & Leisure PR Index (.SXTP), followed by a decline of around 1% and more in other indices and stocks.\n\nIncreased Foreign Capital and Investments in Asian Stocks\n\nThe impact of the Fed official's remarks about no rate cuts, led to major declines in the Asian stock market. However, the first quarter of 2024 presented a great outlook for the stock market in the region. On April 5, Reuters reported that Asian stocks surged in March, driven by the increased traction from foreign investors. The quarter was recorded as the best for foreign investments over the past three years, fueled by expectations of relaxed monetary policies and economic growth in the region, specifically China. According to the stock exchange data across India, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, foreign investors bought a total of $8.53 billion of regional equities in March. The total inflow for the quarter reached $18.57 billion, recording the highest investments since December 2020.\n\nNow that we have discussed the stock market outlook for 2024 and talked about the major markets, let's have a look at the 30 largest stock exchanges in the world. 30 Largest Stock Exchanges in the World\n\nA successful investor looking at the stock market performance on a digital device.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 30 largest stock exchanges in the world, we utilized the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) market statistics for stock exchanges.

        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Lam Research (LRCX) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $7.25 a share, just nine days from its upcoming earnings release on April 24, 2024.\n\nLam Research's Earnings ESP sits at 0.26%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $7.25 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.23.\n\nLRCX is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 7, 2024.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this server technology company have returned -15.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, which Super Micro falls in, has lost 7.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nSuper Micro is expected to post earnings of $5.97 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +266.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.15 points to a change of +87.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.95 indicates a change of +30.7% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Super Micro.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.11 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +219.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.76 billion and $19.11 billion estimates indicate +107.3% and +29.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.66 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +103.3%. EPS of $5.59 for the same period compares with $3.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +14.02%. The EPS surprise was +2.01%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Super Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 In Right Now",
        "content": "With the S&P 500 climbing, extending its gains in this bull market, you may wonder if it's too late to get in on the action. But I've got some good news for you: When you invest over the long term -- at least five years -- you'll find great investing opportunities during any market environment. In investing, time is on your side, offering you the chance to benefit as a company evolves and delivers on various promises from product launches to earnings growth.\n\nToday is a particularly interesting moment to invest in technology as we head for what could be the next revolution in the field: artificial intelligence (AI). Some AI stocks have soared, while others haven't yet gained momentum -- and in both of these areas, you'll find players likely to gain over the long term. That's why if you have $50,000, or even a smaller amount, that you don't need for everyday expenses and want to grow over time, it's a fantastic idea to invest it in a basket of tech stocks that may benefit from the AI boom.\n\nSo now, let's talk about the best stocks to buy right now. The following four all could become AI winners, but they also have solid businesses beyond this technology. So, when you buy them, you aren't betting the farm on just one particular area, and this offers you a fantastic combination of growth and safety. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has soared a mind-boggling 2,200% over the past three years, so you may hesitate to get in on this story now. But this actually could be just the beginning of Supermicro's growth story because we're in the early days of AI development -- and Supermicro can benefit from growth of all of the top AI chipmakers.\n\nThis is because the maker of servers, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment needed for AI includes chips of these players in its systems -- and it follows their product development closely so that it can immediately make these innovations available to its customers.\n\nSupermicro said recently that it's seeing ongoing record demand for its rack scale solutions for AI including some of these best-selling chips. And new releases, such as the upcoming launch of Nvidia's Blackwell architecture could further boost orders. All of this should translate into ongoing earnings growth well into the future and push the shares higher.\n\n2. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) is the leading maker of central processing units, the key component of a computer. But Intel hasn't yet benefited from the excitement surrounding AI. The chipmaker fell behind in the AI space, and that's been one of the elements weighing on its shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut things may be about to change for two reasons. Intel recently launched a new portfolio of AI products, including its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator that may even challenge Nvidia's H100 chip.\n\nOf course, Nvidia's preparing to launch its most powerful chip ever based on the Blackwell architecture as mentioned above -- so I don't expect Intel to beat this market leader. But it doesn't have to. Gaudi 3's performance and affordability could help it carve out enough market share to boost Intel's earnings and eventually share price over time.\n\nAnd Intel's second bit of good news? The company is opening up its manufacturing to others, and this could result in a whole new growth driver as the AI boom continues.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has a long track record of earnings growth thanks to its leadership in the high-growth markets of e-commerce and cloud computing. And this is likely to continue as the company has invested to help it maintain leadership here. In e-commerce, Amazon has revamped its fulfillment network to make deliveries faster, a move that pleases customers and makes Amazon more cost efficient.\n\nAs for cloud computing, AI is set to play a big role in growth moving forward. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is heavily investing to serve the AI customer's every need -- from the basics like chips and software to a fully managed service that allows customers to tailor popular large language models for their own use.\n\nThis should help AWS keep its long-held position as the world's No. 1 cloud computing services provider -- and lift revenue over time. That's particularly good news because AWS historically has been the driver of overall profit at Amazon. And all of this means Amazon stock has plenty of room to run, even after recent gains.\n\n4. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is known for helping most of us on a daily basis. It's the owner of Google Search, the search engine with more than 90% share of the global search market. Alphabet's top business even has managed to enter our language, with people often answering a question with: \"let's Google it.\"\n\nAnd now, Alphabet's investment in AI is likely to further strengthen the company's leadership in the search market. Alphabet recently launched Gemini, it's most advanced AI model yet, and is incorporating AI in all products and services -- including search. The move is making search better and making the advertising process easier, and this should keep advertising revenue climbing. This is key because Alphabet makes most of its revenue through Google advertising.\n\nAlphabet also offers investors a solid track record of earnings growth, and even during the recent difficult economic times, advertising revenue held up pretty well. That makes this company one of the safest AI bets on my list, and a great place to park a portion of your $50,000 today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "content": "The speed with which artificial intelligence (AI) caught on last year took many investors by surprise, and it sparked a changing of the guard among the ranks of the world's most valuable companies. Apple was finally dethroned by Microsoft, which now tops the list as the only company that currently has a market cap of more than $3 trillion. Nvidia, fueled by its industry-leading AI processors, has tripled over the past year to take the No. 3 spot, behind Apple with $2.6 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all major players in the AI revolution and also members of this auspicious fraternity.\n\nWith a market cap of just $53 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like hyperbole to suggest that Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, could make a run at the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating demand for AI-centric servers and the company's decades of expertise suggest that Supermicro is a dark horse candidate in the race. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nServers of the stars\n\nWhile Supermicro has been creating customized server solutions for more than 30 years, the company was working in relative obscurity until the accelerating adoption of AI kicked off. It turns out that Supermicro has amassed quite a pedigree out of the glare of the spotlight.\n\nSupermicro has built its reputation by providing highly customizable, energy-efficient, liquid-cooled rack-scale servers designed to handle the rigors of AI and hyperscale data centers. The company has developed strong working relationships and works hand-in-hand with all the top AI chipmakers to ensure its rack-scale servers are top performers while also providing energy efficiency and the lowest total cost of ownership in the industry. It boasts partnerships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\n\nThis is a winning strategy that has its AI-centric servers flying off the shelves. For its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 103% year over year to $3.7 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $5.10 jumped 85%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year guidance to $14.5 billion, which would represent growth of 104%.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement reports that Supermicro grew five times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is stealing market share from its rivals. Analysts at Northland agree, suggesting the company has increased its market share to 11%, leaving \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nSupermicro is in an enviable position among AI server makers. The company is small enough to be nimble and has a long history of providing customized server solutions to enterprises. Furthermore, the strong and enduring relationships Supermicro has forged with chipmakers give it the inside track and an abundant supply of the processors used for AI. Despite those advantages and the clear opportunity, a lot will have to go right for Supermicro to join the ranks of the trillionaires.\n\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is poised to generate revenue of $14.7 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3.6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $275 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. To be clear, the company is currently ramping up production to support annual sales of $25 billion, so revenue of that magnitude is still a ways off.\n\nIf the company were able to keep up its triple-digit, year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap threshold by 2031. That said, it's unlikely the company will keep up its current rate of parabolic growth. If we cut its revenue growth rate assumption to 50%, Supermicro could potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035.\n\nThere's reason to believe strong demand for AI-centric servers will continue. BofA analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya suggests the data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the next three years, and Supermicro's revenue could grow even faster.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is equally bullish, suggesting that the installed base of data centers will double to $2 trillion over the coming four to five years.\n\nIf Supermicro captures even a small part of that vast opportunity, the company will soon join the $1 trillion club.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In the current market scenario, the one sector that promises significant returns in the coming years is the tech sector. Driven by artificial intelligence (AI), the tech sector has been thriving, and tech stocks have been hitting new highs over the past few months. There is immense potential in the industry, and according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), AI-related investments will reach $200 billion globally by 2025. As the adoption of AI increases and it penetrates multiple industries, we will see companies report impressive numbers, and now is the time to watch out for AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe companies not adopting or investing in AI could end up losing a lot of business. The success of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is proof of the impact of AI in our world, and it is currently crowned the winner in the AI race. However, there is still a long way to go, and several companies are investing in AI to make the most of the hype. If you missed out on the chance to buy NVDA stock, here are seven AI stocks to buy if you want to make the most of the AI frenzy.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of the AI revolution, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) enjoys an early-mover advantage of having invested in OpenAI and integrated AI into its products and services. It has a comprehensive approach to integrating AI in all the services, allowing for higher revenue and growth in the years ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company has already achieved success with the cloud and is aiming to monetize through Microsoft Copilot. It has a subscription model, and the company has seen a massive rise in the number of subscribers, with over 1 million in October 2023. That will give a revenue boost to the company.\n\nI am certain its quarterly results will be impressive, and if you want to own only one tech stock, it has to be Microsoft. Up 14% year-to-date (YTD), MSFT stock will steadily keep moving higher, and the results could lead to a rally. The stock also pays a dividend and has a modest yield of 0.70%.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) has been making big moves lately and is on an aggressive expansion spree. It is building 100 data centers and launched the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platform to offer cloud services to other companies. The company has recently signed a deal with Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) to combine their AI prowess.\n\nThe deal can be game-changing and improve the growth prospects of both companies. It also signed a contract with Nvidia, where both companies will market cloud offerings, AI chips and software. These deals show Oracle\u2019s strength to win the market. It has also reported impressive third-quarter results with a 7% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle also saw a 29% YOY jump in the order backlog. Trading at $123 today, the stock is up 18% YTD and 31% in the year. An established industry player, Oracle has all it takes to succeed in the thriving AI space.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the hottest tech companies right now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) plays a crucial role in expanding the AI industry. It is also a very important industry player for Nvidia since TSM makes most of the chips designed by Nvidia and the chips required to run AI technologies.\n\nThe company recently won $6.6 billion in government funding for chip production. That is aimed at increasing the company\u2019s manufacturing capacity in the U.S. The company will expand its investment in Arizona by $25 billion to $65 billion and is set to add a third plant in the state by 2030.\n\nTSMC\u2019s future looks bright, and the stock is already up 44% YTD. The company also reported the fastest monthly revenue growth since 2022, with sales hitting $6.1 billion in one month, up 34% YOY.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoaring higher than Nvidia, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is up 235% YTD and 785% on the year. Trading for $937 today, the stock might look expensive, but it is worth your money. Directly related to Nvidia, SMCI will grow whenever Nvidia does. It integrates its motherboard designs with Nvidia processors and is one of the best out there right now.\n\nWhile SMCI is heavily dependent on Nvidia, I believe it has one of the best liquid cooling products in the industry and it gets early access to Nvidia\u2019s chips. AI servers require the right cooling servers and that is where Super Micro Computer is set to benefit. It is looking at expanding production, which will help improve the financials.\n\nIt reported impressive financials in the fourth quarter, with net sales hitting $3.66 billion and EPS up 62%, hitting $5.10 per share. Analysts have a high price target for the stock, and the company has to live up to the expectations.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) isn\u2019t making as much noise in the AI industry as its counterparts, it is still gaining momentum. The company is working on an affordable AI chip and still has a strong hold on Google Search and Google Cloud. These are the two highest revenue-generating segments for the company and contribute to the business growth.\n\nOne big reason to invest in Alphabet is its sheer potential to innovate. It is working on the new Arm-based AI CPU, which could be a game changer for the business. Alphabet is a highly stable company with a rich history, and its solid market share makes it one of the best tech stocks to own.\n\nThe stock is up 15% YTD and is trading for $160 right now. It looks highly undervalued to me, and analysts say it could hit $185 very soon. Oppenheimer analysts set a price target of $185 for the stock.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest competitor of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), is slowly growing its AI products. It launched a series of microchips designed for AI applications and is ready to take on Nvidia.\n\nThe company launched the MI300X microchip, which will be used for servers and data centers. Some of the top tech companies, including Microsoft, have been buying these chips. AMD stock is up 18% YTD and exchanging hands for $170. It is up 80% in the year and could hit $200 very soon.\n\nIf you think Nvidia is too expensive, now is the time to grab AMD before it skyrockets. Considered an industry underdog, the market is highly optimistic about the future of AMD. It is looking for sales of $5.4 billion in the first quarter, and I believe it will report strong fundamentals. AMD has a history of excelling in the industry, and any dip in the stock is a chance to buy.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies has been crushing the market with its AI prowess. Up 35% YTD, the stock is exchanging hands for $22 and is on a rally. The stock has soared since February after the company reported impressive numbers driven by the artificial intelligence platform (AIP) boot camps.\n\nThe company is making the most of the rising demand for cloud and has integrated AI into its products. It signed 103 deals worth at least $1 million in the fourth quarter and has a backlog of boot camps. Palantir saw a 70% YOY increase in commercial revenue in the quarter and a 55% rise in consumer count.\n\nAs mentioned above, Palantir\u2019s partnership with Oracle is set to benefit the business, as its applications will be available through Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure. I wrote about Palantir earlier and believe it has the potential to double your money. Considering the high demand for AI in the industry, Palantir is set to have an exceptional 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Super Micro Computer, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SMCI) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 165% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Super Micro Computer's  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Super Micro Computer is:\n\n24% = US$732m \u00f7 US$3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.24 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's Earnings Growth And 24% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Super Micro Computer has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 10% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, Super Micro Computer's considerable five year net income growth of 53% was to be expected.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared Super Micro Computer's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 22%. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is SMCI fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Super Micro Computer Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nSuper Micro Computer doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Super Micro Computer's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Ready for a Split",
        "content": "Many top technology stocks have completed stock splits in recent years, from Amazon to Alphabet, as their shares roared higher. The move involves a company issuing additional shares to current holders in order to lower the price of each individual share. This doesn't change the market value of the company or the value of your investment -- but it's positive for the company because it makes the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors.\n\nAnd for investors, a stock split often signals that a company has been doing well and management expects the momentum to continue -- and that could, once again, drive up the shares over time. So it's worth taking a close look at stock-split companies, as some might make interesting long-term investments.\n\nCompanies that make great candidates for a split often are active in a high-growth industry and have seen their shares climb quickly, even reaching the $1,000 mark. This is the case for two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks right now. They haven't announced a split, but I wouldn't be surprised if they do so in the near future, thanks to their incredible performance over the past few years. Let's take a closer look at these AI stocks that look ready for a split. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has climbed 500% over the past three years as the company established its position as the world's AI chip giant. The company sells graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the most crucial steps in any AI project: the training and inferencing of AI models. This allows those models to then do what we'd like them to do, such as solve complex problems.\n\nThe tech giant's GPUs initially were known for powering video games and graphics, but the introduction of programming platform CUDA made it easy to use GPUs for general computing -- and this opened the door to using them for AI. Now, instead of generating most of its revenue from the video game business, Nvidia instead generates it from the data center business. Last year, revenue and profit soared in the triple digits,\u00a0and considering we're in the early days of the AI boom, growth could continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has split its stock five times in the past, with the most recent operation happening in 2021 after the stock posted a period of gains -- and at that point, the shares traded for less than $250.\n\nThis year, Nvidia stock has climbed higher than $900, bringing it very close to the $1,000 level -- one that could dissuade some investors from buying the stock. Right now could be a great moment for this AI star to launch a stock split due to the current stock price and due to the fact that a new growth driver could be just ahead. The company plans on releasing its new Blackwell architecture and chips later this year, and growth from that platform could supercharge Nvidia stock.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has skyrocketed, even surpassing Nvidia when it comes to share performance in recent times. The stock has soared more than 2,200% over the past three years and climbed beyond $1,000 earlier this year before dipping to the current level of about $940.\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro has seen its revenue stream transform thanks to demand for AI. The 30-year-old company, a maker of servers, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment, announced its first $3 billion quarter ever just recently as AI customers flocked to its products. Supermicro works closely with top chipmakers including Nvidia so that it can quickly integrate their products into its platforms, and this has kept demand soaring to records. It also means that Supermicro benefits from not only its own new product releases, but the new chip releases from all the big chip companies -- from Nvidia to Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nCustomers also like Supermicro's products because they are specifically tailored to their needs, and the company's building blocks manner of construction means it can quickly fill orders.\n\nSupermicro's earnings have soared in recent times, and the company has made moves to maximize its economies of scale to keep the good times rolling. The tech giant is doing this by expanding production, with a new Malaysia facility to focus on lower costs and higher volume.\n\nSupermicro has never split its stock, but now would be the perfect time to launch such an operation, considering the stock's price today -- and the potential for a new wave of growth ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Turn $10,000 Into $1 Million: April 2024",
        "content": "The market is going through a rough patch. Inflation came in hot for the month of March at an annualized rate of 3.5%, dashing hopes for interest rate cuts in the near-term. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, core inflation increased by 3.8% from a year ago in March, well above the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% annualized target. Futures markets don\u2019t expect the central bank to start cutting interest rates until September of this year, and for there to only be two rate cuts by Dec. 31. So what\u2019s an investor looking for stocks to turn $10,000 into $1 million supposed to do?\n\nAs recently as a week ago, markets had priced in the first rate cut happening in June and for there to be three rate cuts in 2024. As a result, trading activity in stocks has been volatile to start the second quarter, with the major indices pulling back in recent sessions. While concerning, the upheaval hasn\u2019t taken down all stocks. Some equities continue to thrive and lead the entire market. Areas such as crypto, artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductors remain strong. Some stocks have already doubled this year.\n\nHere are three stocks to focus on if you\u2019re looking to turn $10,000 into $1 million.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf cryptocurrencies continue running higher, as is expected, then Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) could be a solid bet. COIN stock has already enjoyed a blistering rally having more than tripled (up 277%) over the last 12 months. A little more than three months into this year and Coinbase\u2019s share price is up 63%. The cryptocurrency exchange has been running hot as trading in digital assets rebounds after a bear market throughout 2022. In the past year, crypto trading has surged and gone into overdrive after U.S. regulators approved spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January.\n\nDriven by a surge in crypto trading, Coinbase reported blowout earnings for the fourth and final quarter of 2024, sending its stock higher. Notably, the company reported its first profit in two years. The biggest crypto exchange in the U.S. announced earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04 compared to just 27 cents that was forecast on Wall Street. Coinbase also reported that its revenue increased 58% from a year earlier to $953.8 million, ahead of expectations for $818.36 million. With crypto prices rising, so too will COIN stock. If you\u2019re on the hunt for stocks to turn $10,000 into $1 million, COIN could be a lucrative option.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s likely to be a rocky ride, but for investors looking to get rich, there are few stocks that can match Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The company, which makes the servers that AI applications run on, continues to lead the benchmark S&P 500 index when it comes to gains this year. Since January, SMCI stock has risen an astounding 217%. In the last 12 months, the share price is up nearly 800%. Super Micro Computer continues to run laps around nearly every other stock.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a meme stock. Super Micro Computer is a legitimate company that happens to be the right stock for the AI revolution that\u2019s taking place. Thanks to its rapid growth, SMCI was added to the S&P 500 index in this year\u2019s first quarter, and analysts continue to upgrade the shares despite the massive rally. JPMorgan Chase recently initiated coverage on the stock with an \u201coverweight\u201d (buy) rating and a $1,150 price target, implying 27% upside from current levels.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares have really taken off after the company\u2019s latest earnings report. MU stock has nearly doubled over the past 12 months, including a 49% gain since January of this year. It has become a hot new AI play for investors. The company, which makes memory storage for computers and specializes in USB flash drives, reported earnings per share (EPS) of 42 cents compared to a loss of 28 cents that was expected among analysts who cover the company.\n\nRevenue totaled $5.82 billion versus $5.35 billion that was expected on Wall Street. Executives at the company said they are benefitting from the current AI boom, with demand for its memory and computer data storage products rising. Looking ahead, management expects revenue of $6.6 billion for the just-completed first quarter, above the $6.02 billion that was expected on Wall Street. Given the robust outlook, MU stock can expect to continue its rise moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "How Soon Will Super Micro Computer Stock Hit $1,500?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has been on a tear in 2024, clocking outstanding gains of 216% already as investors have been buying shares of this server manufacturer hand over fist to take advantage of its outstanding growth.\n\nSupermicro's red-hot rally has brought its stock price to around $950. That's almost in line with the 12-month median price target of $949, according to 18 analysts covering the stock. The median price target suggests that Supermicro may not have more upside to offer. However, the Street-high price target of $1,350 points toward 31% gains from current levels.\n\nHowever, will Supermicro be able to crush these expectations and head to $1,500 in the long run? If yes, how soon can investors expect that milestone to arrive? Let's try and find the answers to these questions.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is built for more upside\n\nSupermicro's stunning 2024 rally explains why the stock is now trading at almost 74 times trailing earnings. That's significantly higher than the company's five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16. However, as the following chart indicates, Supermicro's bottom-line growth has taken off big-time in the past couple of years, which justifies the rich earnings multiple it currently commands. SMCI EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nEven better, Supermicro's earnings growth potential is so solid that its forward earnings multiples are substantially lower than the trailing P/E ratio. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nMore specifically, analysts are expecting the company's earnings to increase 87% in the current fiscal year to $22.10 per share. In the next fiscal year as well, Supermicro is forecast to deliver a robust jump of 39% in earnings to $30.82 per share. The forecast for the next five years remains solid as well, with consensus estimates projecting Supermicro's earnings to increase at an annual pace of 48%.\n\nSupermicro finished its previous fiscal year with adjusted earnings of $11.81 per share. Applying the projected five-year annual growth rate of 48% to last year's earnings, Supermicro's bottom line could jump to just under $84 per share within the next five years. The Nasdaq-100 sports a forward earnings multiple of 27, and assuming Supermicro trades at a similar multiple after five years (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), its stock price could hit $2,268 within the next five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's well above the $1,500 mark that we are trying to find. However, if we dial back a year and calculate Supermicro's potential earnings after four years using the inputs mentioned above, its bottom line could jump to just over $56 a share. Multiplying the estimated earnings after four years with the Nasdaq's forward earnings multiple of 27 points toward a stock price of $1,512.\n\nSo, the $1,500 milestone could arrive for Supermicro within the next four years, assuming management doesn't execute a stock split. However, don't be surprised to see that mark arriving sooner as Supermicro is taking steps to capitalize on the rapidly growing artificial intelligence (AI) server market, which could help it achieve faster earnings growth.\n\nThis big catalyst could supercharge its bottom-line growth\n\nThe pace at which analysts are expecting Supermicro's earnings to grow may not be considering the company's expanding production capacity, which should allow it to deliver stronger-than-expected growth. This is evident from the fact that the company's revenue is expected to jump to just over $22 billion after a couple of fiscal years. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nHowever, Supermicro has expanded its capacity to support $25 billion in annual revenue. It won't be surprising to see the company selling out that entire revenue capacity as the production utilization rate of its plants stood at 65% in the previous quarter, and management pointed out that the remaining capacity is filling up quickly. But more importantly, Supermicro is undertaking initiatives to further enhance its manufacturing capacity.\n\nThat's the right thing to do considering that the size of the AI server market could increase sixfold from 2023 to $150 billion in 2027. As such, there is a possibility that Super Micro Computer's growth could be higher than what analysts are forecasting, and that's the reason why this AI stock could achieve the $1,500 stock price target earlier than the four-year time frame discussed above.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Savvy investors know that when there's a gold rush underway, buying the stocks of companies that are supplying the \"picks and shovels\" is a proven wealth-building strategy. When it comes to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, it's the computing infrastructure that makes the game-changing technology possible. Think chips and computer servers rather than pickaxes and sifting pans.\n\nIf this lower-risk investment approach sounds appealing, read on to learn about two key AI infrastructure providers that have particularly attractive growth prospects. Both of their stocks are intriguing buys today.\n\n1. Arm Holdings\n\nWith a staggering 30.6 billion chips shipped in its 2023 fiscal year alone, Arm Holdings' (NASDAQ: ARM) reach spans nearly every tech-focused market. From personal computers (PCs) and data centers to smartphones and autonomous vehicles, demand for Arm's energy-efficient semiconductor technology is skyrocketing.\n\nMany leading chipmakers develop their products using Arm's architecture. In September, Apple extended its partnership with Arm, which will allow the tech titan to incorporate Arm's intellectual property into its custom-designed chips for its popular iPhones and Macs until at least 2040. In November, Microsoft announced that its cloud computing services would offer access to new Arm-based chips. And in March, Nvidia debuted its powerful Blackwell high-performance computing platform that features Arm processors. All told, Arm estimates that 70% of the world's population uses products built with its technology.\n\nMoreover, thanks to the combination of performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of its chip architecture, Arm is gaining market share in all of its key markets. Image source: Arm Holdings.\n\nThis expanding market share is driving strong growth in Arm's sales and profits. Revenue rose 14% to $824 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, while adjusted net income jumped 36% to $305 million.\n\nHigher spending on AI solutions is fueling Arm's growth. \"We are seeing the demand for Arm technology to enable AI everywhere, from the cloud to edge devices in your hand,\" CEO Rene Haas and CFO Jason Child said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nArm's sales, in turn, are likely to accelerate. The company expects its revenue to increase by as much as 42% in its fiscal fourth quarter.\n\n\"We believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we're only at the beginning,\" Haas said during an interview with Bloomberg in February.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nIt's not just chipmakers that are benefiting from the AI gold rush. Demand for high-performance servers, data storage systems, and other AI-focused computing infrastructure is soaring. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is helping to supply its customers with the innovative hardware solutions they need to power their AI ambitions -- and business is booming.\n\nThe server specialist has close ties to Nvidia. In turn, the insatiable demand for Nvidia's cutting-edge processors is also driving sales of the supporting computing hardware that Supermicro (as the company is also known) provides.\n\nSupermicro's sales surged 103% year over year to $3.7 billion in its fiscal 2024 second quarter, which ended on Dec. 31. Better still, the company's net income jumped 68% to $296 million, even as it spent aggressively to ramp up production.\n\nThis strong performance, combined with encouraging ongoing sales trends, drove management to boost its full-year revenue projection to $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion, up from a previous estimate of $10 billion to $11 billion. That would be more than double the $7.1 billion in sales the company earned in fiscal 2023.\n\nMoreover, Supermicro's share price has pulled back from its recent highs following its stock offering in March. But that stock sale raised roughly $1.7 billion that the company can now use to bolster its manufacturing network and fund its other expansion initiatives.\n\nThose growth investments should bear fruit for Supermicro's shareholders. The market for AI servers will exceed $177 billion by 2032, up from $38 billion in 2023, according to Global Market Insights. Investors who buy Supermicro's shares at a discount today should be well rewarded as it works to satisfy the torrid demand for its AI tools.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Some traders are buying Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock because the company sells artificial intelligence enabled servers. They\u2019re looking for the \u201cnext\u201d Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). It\u2019s a dangerous quest, though, and this is the worst possible time to invest Super Micro Computer stock.\n\nTruly, this is a recipe for disaster. As we\u2019ll discover, the sentiment and expectations surrounding SMCI are sky high. Chasers get punished eventually, and with Super Micro Computer, I believe the reckoning will be sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Dizzying Ascent of SMCI Stock\n\nWhy did SMCI stock zoom from $100 to around $1,200 during the past year? And, just as importantly, why is the stock apparently starting to roll over?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe most obvious answer is that, as I alluded to earlier, AI-hardware hype is in full effect and everybody wants the \u201cnext\u201d Nvidia stock. That\u2019s not the only contributing factor, though.\n\nCurrently, Super Micro Computer is \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d as it\u2019s a member of both the S&P 500and theRussell 2000. Thus, when funds and individual investors buy these indexes, they\u2019re indirectly propping up SMCI stock.\n\nOne might whether Super Micro Computer can continue to be a member of a large-cap index and a small-cap index for much longer. Investors may also ask if Super Micro Computer\u2019s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 73.93x is sustainable.\n\nA Bad Sign for Super Micro Computer\n\nNow, after the wild share-price ascent, Super Micro Computer has to live up to high expectations. For example, JPMorgan analysts set a $1,150 price target on Super Micro Computer stock, while Northland analyst Nehal Chokshi envisions the stock rallying to $1,300.\n\nMoreover, Super Micro Computer lifted its fiscal 2024 revenue guidance from a range of $10 billion to $11 billion, to a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. That\u2019s a big revenue-guidance hike, and it appears that the market has already priced its lofty expectations into the shares.\n\nYet, there\u2019s a development that prospective investors can\u2019t afford to ignore. Specifically, Super Micro Computer announced its plan to sell 2 million shares of the company at $875 apiece.\n\nThe news release for that announcement is dated March 19. On that day, Super Micro Computer stock traded at around $900; just a few days earlier, it traded at nearly $1,200. Thus, the company was evidently prepared to sell its shares at a discount.\n\nIt\u2019s not a positive sign that Super Micro Computer is willing to sell millions of shares to the public to raise capital. This raises some questions.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow desperate is Super Micro Computer for capital? And, will the company resort to share-value-dilutive capital-raising measures in the future?\n\nSuper Micro Computer Stock Isn\u2019t a Confident Investment\n\nSuper Micro Computer benefited from AI-hardware hype, \u201cnext\u201d Nvidia fantasies and \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d in two major stock indexes. Now, with Super Micro Computer at a very high valuation, SMCI stock looks like it\u2019s rolling over.\n\nOn top of all that, investors should be concerned about Super Micro Computer\u2019s large-scale share sale.\n\nIn the final analysis, the risk-to-reward balance is unfavorable for Super Micro Computer stock. This is a great time to take profits on the stock, or if you\u2019re not invested, just avoid it altogether.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Invesco\u2019s Nick Kalivas on Midcap Investing and Factor Strategies",
        "content": "This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.\n\nWith companies such as Supermicro Computer recently graduating to the S&P 500, investors are renewing interest in midcap companies with strong growth potential. Invesco offers investing expertise in the midcap space, applying factor screening to seek out quality investments in midcap companies. Nick Kalivas, Invesco head of factor and core equity product strategy, recently sat down with VettaFi to discuss the potential of midcap investing and the benefits a factor-based approach can provide.\n\nNick Wodeshick: Supermicro Computer recently got added to the S&P 500. Do you see this as an indicator that investors should start looking at more midcap companies?\n\nNick Kalivas, Invesco head of factor and core equity product strategy: I think the example of Supermicro Computer is a reminder to investors that smaller companies can grow quickly and provide investment opportunity.\n\nI feel in the kind of post-COVID era, investors have been just kind of enamored with big technology stocks. And they've kind of forgotten that, small technology stocks can also present good growth opportunities. I think Supermicro Computer is a reminder to investors to reexamine or rethink about opportunities down the cap spectrum.\n\nNick Wodeshick: Two of Invesco's midcap factor ETFs [the Invesco S&P Midcap Quality ETF (XMHQ) and the Invesco S&P Midcap 400 GARP ETF (GRPM)] saw over $1 billion in net flows in the first quarter of 2024. Do you see these funds continuing to show such strong growth throughout the year? And do you think there's any other funds that might be joining them?\n\nNick Kalivas: [I'll step back] and give a little bit of background. Factors in the large-cap space, in recent years, have struggled a bit, because of the narrowness of the market leadership, the \"Mag Seven.\" Just the strength in the top names, and because most factor strategies have a factor weighting to them. So they're not overweighing those big names. When you go down the cap spectrum, there has not been the concentration problem. The big growers, they graduated to the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, factor performance has been fairly good, and it's been good down the cap spectrum. And it's been kind of forgotten. So, I think what you've seen with this flow, is this kind of realization that there are very good growth opportunities. And there are opportunities in factor investing down the cap spectrum.\n\nI think what we've seen here in the last year to six months is kind of a sign that, going forward, investors are going to be thinking more about factor strategies down the cap spectrum. I think a lot of advisors, when they think about down the cap spectrum, they either kind of just go bulk data, the kind of [Implied volatility] index, or they might act more active.\n\nBut I think, given the performance we've seen in tickers like XMHQ or XMMO, and we just recently launched a GARP strategy there -- GRPM -- and we've done so also in small-cap space with GARP. I think these are gonna get more looks. And I think that's going to translate into better flow over time.\n\nNick Wodeshick: What do you see as the biggest advantages of investing in midcap companies, compared to small-caps and large-caps?\n\nNick Kalivas: The midcap space is attractive on a couple of fronts. I think [No. 1] the companies are more seasoned, or they tend to be financially bigger than the small-caps. I think that provides a level of comfort to investors who are looking to invest in the SMID space. And then on the other hand, relative to large-cap companies, they have potential to see faster growth. They're smaller. The law of large numbers works against the big names. You can see very strong returns in the midcap space because of that growth potential.\n\nI think that's really its advantage -- like, the companies are seen as a little more seasoned than what you get in a small-cap space. That provides some risk mitigation and comfort. And then you can also get faster growth than what you see in the large-cap space. So you get opportunities like you kind of saw with Supermicro Computer, or like a lot of people have also focused a bit on Deckers, which had which had a pretty good run and actually also graduated into the S&P 500 in March too.\n\nNick Wodeshick: Looking back at midcaps, everyone's talking about rate cuts on the horizon. Do you see any chance that midcap investing could be affected by the Federal Reserve's moves?\n\nNick Kalivas: I think incrementally kind of holding things constant. If we see the growth expectations embedded in the midcap space come about, and you were to overlay the effect of rate cuts on the markets, I think that would bode well. And I think it would help risk taking. I think people would feel more comfortable going down the market cap spectrum.\n\nSo I do think it would be a plus. But I hear a lot of this Fed talk in the market. What's probably more important is, does the expected trough in earnings growth materialize? And does it accelerate like it's expected to into year-end? I think, even without the Fed, if that were to be the case, it would be very good for the midcaps.\n\nFor example, at the end of 2024, if you look at some of the estimates that Standard & Poor's has put out on their website, the S&P 400 earnings growth is supposed to be 20.5%at the end of this year, compared to 12.5 for the S&P 500. So, that type of earnings growth, if that were to manifest itself, I think would be very constructive. Getting a Fed rate cut on top of that would just kind of be icing on the cake.\n\nNick Wodeshick: Is there anything else you wanted to add about midcap investing, or about Invesco's library?\n\nNick Kalivas: It's important to highlight that we offer the rewarded risk premium, the rewarded factors down the cap spectrum. And so if you're thinking about momentum, or GARP, or low volatility, or value, or growth, we are offering that. So, investors have a lot of options within the Invesco lineup.\n\nIf you're not necessarily a factor investor, and you just kind of want to look at alternative types of weightings and think a little bit outside the market cap box, we also have the revenue weight suite that goes up and down the cap spectrum. Those funds I think are also an interesting alternative to just plain market cap or bull beta investment.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Innovative ETFs Channel.\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n\nSPY ETF Quote VOO ETF Quote QQQ ETF Quote VTI ETF Quote JNUG ETF Quote Top 34 Gold ETFs  Top 34 Oil ETFs  Top 57 Financials ETFs\n\nObra Capital Launches 2 Structured Product ETFs Why Active Fixed Income ETFs Matter Capturing a Rapid AI Evolution: Q1 THNQ Index Rebalance ROBO Index Q1 Spotlight: Toyota Industries Optimizes Logistics Automation The ETF Flowdown: Q1 2024\n\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >",

        "content": "ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its \u201cClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy\u201d first quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The Strategy underperformed the benchmark in the quarter. The small-cap growth universe revealed a stark dichotomy despite the positive performance of the benchmark Russell 2000 Growth Index, which returned 7.58% in the first quarter. The Strategy posted gains in 5 of the nine sectors in which it was invested on an absolute basis. Overall stock selection detracted from performance, partially offset by positive sector allocation effects on a relative basis. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy featured stocks MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) in the first quarter 2024 investor letter. Headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia, MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) provides\u00a0artificial intelligence-powered enterprise analytics software and services. On April 9, 2024, MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock closed at $1,441.02 per share. One-month return of MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) was -18.41%, and its shares gained 346.37% of their value over the last 52 weeks. MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) has a market capitalization of $24.451 billion.\n\nClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR)\u00a0in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"While large cap benchmarks get a lot of attention for a handful of mega cap stocks driving the lion's share of performance, we would highlight even more extreme and unprecedented concentration in small cap benchmarks. Year to date, one stock, Super Micro Computer has driven 37% of the return of the benchmark, closely followed by MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), a unique stock that is largely considered a bitcoin proxy. Together, they accounted for over half of the benchmark's first quarter return. This compares to Nvidia, which accounted for 24% of the return of the S&P 500 Index. The 32 top-performing stocks in the Russell 2000 Growth Index accounted for 100% of its return, versus 81 names driving the S&P 500's performance this quarter.\n\nCurrently, SMCI is the largest constituent by weight in our benchmark, and it peaked at over 4.5%, representing the largest individual security weight in a monthly dataset going back to 1985. That represented a weighting 83% higher than the second-largest weight (from 1999). Moreover, MicroStrategy at its peak this past quarter would have represented the fourth-largest security in the 38 years of the monthly dataset. We are hard-pressed to recall another instance where the largest constituent of our benchmark was also added to the S&P 500, as SMCI was this March. We would note that SMCI currently is a $61 billion market capitalization company and MicroStrategy boasts a market capitalization of $28 billion, both well above the $6.8 billion weighted average market cap of the Strategy.\n\nEnthusiasm for AI and bitcoin have fueled this atypical concentration and performance distortion. Bitcoin rallied fast and furiously following the SEC's approval of the first bitcoin ETF in early January, while the AI infrastructure build-out has had a narrow set of beneficiaries. Against this backdrop, the ClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy underperformed its benchmark. We are disappointed by this result, although 79% of the relative underperformance was due to not owning these two large benchmark holdings, which have fundamental and governance factors that have caused us, as long-term investors focused on quality sustainable growth stories, to avoid them.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA software engineer wearing a headset, collaborating with a remote team on a project.\n\nMicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) is not on our list of\u00a030 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "title": "5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 86%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "No next-big-thing investment trend has arguably been hotter since the advent of the internet than artificial intelligence (AI) is right now.\n\nWhen discussing \"AI,\" I'm referring to software and systems handling tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. Machine learning gives software and systems the ability to learn and evolve without human intervention, which can make these systems more proficient at their tasks over time.\n\nThe utility of AI can't be overstated enough. Almost every sector and industry can benefit from its use, which is probably why the analysts at PwC believe artificial intelligence will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy come 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile most institutional money managers and Wall Street analysts view AI and the companies deploying AI infrastructure and software favorably, this bullishness isn't universal. Based on the low-water price targets issued by a select group of Wall Street analysts, the following five AI stocks could plunge by as much as 86%!\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 30%\n\nThe first AI stock that could tumble after a monstrous run higher is none other than the infrastructure backbone of the AI revolution, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). In February, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria raised his and his firms' price target on Nvidia to $620 from $410. Despite this epic increase, it implies that the third-largest public company by market cap in the U.S. will shed 30% of its value, based on where it closed on April 5.\n\nAlthough Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have been the overwhelming top choice of businesses for AI-accelerated data centers, there are plenty of reasons to be believe Nvidia stock could be in a bubble.\n\nTo start with, Nvidia's top four customers, which comprise about 40% of its sales, are all developing AI GPUs of their own. Even if these companies continue to rely on Nvidia's GPUs as complements to their in-house GPUs, future orders from these industry leaders would be expected to decline.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo add to the above, Nvidia's pricing power on its A100 and H100 GPUs is expected to take a hit in the latter-half of 2024. The lion's share of its 217% increase in data center sales in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) was driven by GPU scarcity. As new competitors enter the arena and Nvidia ramps up its own production, GPU scarcity will diminish -- as will the company's pricing power.\n\nFurther, every next-big-thing trend over the last 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble. Suffice it to say, I fully expect Luria's price target to be hit.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied downside of 74%\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that could plummet in the not-too-distant future if one Wall Street analyst is correct is server and storage solutions company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Senior equity research analyst Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna stood firm on his price target of $250 for Super Micro just two months earlier in an interview on CNBC. This would imply Super Micro Computer losing almost three-quarters of its current value.\n\nIt's understandable why investors have gone head over heels for Super Micro. The company incorporates Nvidia's top-tier GPUs in its energy-efficient and highly customizable rack servers that are utilized in AI-accelerated data centers. Sales for the company are expected to double in 2024 to north of $14 billion.\n\nHowever, we've been here before with Super Micro. It was expected to be a prime beneficiary of the cloud-computing revolution in the late 2010s, but failed to maintain its sales momentum. This speaks to the fact that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption of new trends and innovations.\n\nSuper Micro Computer also finds itself at the mercy of Nvidia. If the latter continues to deal with supply issues/scarcity for its GPUs, Super Micro will fail to realize its full potential.\n\nWhile a retracement to $250 may not be in the cards anytime soon, Super Micro Computer definitely has a lot to prove after its stock appreciated by 767% over the trailing year. A Tesla Model S charging. Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 86%\n\nThe potential disaster du jour among AI stocks is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). CEO and founder Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research believes Tesla will retrace to $23.53 per share, which would represent 86% downside from where it closed on April 5.\n\nOn one hand, Tesla has made history by becoming the first automotive company to build itself from the ground up to mass production in well over a half-century. It's also the only EV pure-play that's generating a recurring profit (four consecutive years, as of the end of 2023).\n\nAt the same time, Tesla is encountering game-changing challenges as EV demand tapers off. The company slashed the sales price of its four production models (3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions in 2023. The end result has been a more-than-halving in Tesla's operating margin since the end of September 2022 (17.2% to 8.2%, as of Dec. 31, 2023).\n\nPerhaps an even bigger issue is that Tesla has failed to become more than just a car company. Its Energy Generation and Storage segment sales have stagnated in recent quarters, while Services is generating a low-single-digit gross margin. I'll add that solar has been a money-loser since SolarCity was acquired in 2016.\n\nDespite being nothing more than a car company, Tesla is valued at nearly 60 times forecast earnings in 2024. With most auto stocks trading in a range of 6 to 8 times expected earnings per share (EPS), there's definite reason to believe Tesla stock will head lower.\n\nMicroStrategy: Implied downside of 85%\n\nA fourth artificial intelligence stock that could get absolutely crushed if the most-bearish Wall Street analyst proves accurate is enterprise analytics software company MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR). Last August, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill defended his firms' lowball price target of $210 for MicroStrategy, which would imply a decline of 85% from where shares closed this past week.\n\nOne issue for MicroStrategy is that its AI-driven enterprise analytics software division stopped growing 10 years ago. Sales have fallen by an aggregate of 14% since peaking.\n\nBut let's face the facts: MicroStrategy is best-known for CEO Michael Saylor's strategy of issuing convertible debt and using the proceeds to buy Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. On March 19, Saylor made a post on X (the platform formerly known as Twitter) that noted his company held 214,246 Bitcoin -- more than 1% of the eventual supply -- at an average price of roughly $35,160 per token.\n\nWith each Bitcoin valued at $67,600, as of the time of this writing, MicroStrategy's crypto stake is worth $14.5 billion. However, the company's market cap currently stands at $24.4 billion. Accounting for the company's modestly profitable (but non-growing) software business, as well as its growing debt pile, MicroStrategy is trading at around a 70% premium to the Bitcoin it holds.\n\nIf investors want to buy Bitcoin, a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a direct purchase of the cryptocurrency on an exchange would be a considerably smarter move than buying into MicroStrategy, whose premium valuation to the current price of Bitcoin makes no sense.\n\nPalantir Technologies: Implied downside of 78%\n\nThe fifth AI stock that could plunge, according to the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is data-mining company Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). Analyst Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital doesn't believe Palantir's Commercial segment margins can continue expanding at their current pace. This compelled Jaluria to recently reiterate his and his firms' $5 price target on Palantir, which implies 78% downside.\n\nThere's no question Palantir's stock is pricey. The company's nearly $51 billion market cap is closing in on a multiple of 19 times forecast sales this year. It's also valued at 70 times consensus EPS in 2024 despite slowing sales growth.\n\nBut one thing Palantir has working for it that merits a hefty premium is its irreplaceability. No company at scale comes anywhere close to the solutions it can provide. Palantir's AI-driven Gotham platform helps governments cull data and plan military operations. The contracts Palantir wins from the U.S. government tend to span multiple years and generate highly predictable cash flow.\n\nMeanwhile, its Foundry platform is just getting off the ground and helping businesses make sense of their data so they can streamline their operations. Whereas a sales ceiling exists with Gotham -- i.e., Palantir won't offer access to its platform to certain countries (e.g., China) -- Foundry has a theoretical growth runway that stretches decades into the future.\n\nThough it could take some time for Palantir to grow into its current valuation, I don't anticipate Jaluria's low-water price target being hit.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Many highly successful stock pickers, including Warren Buffett, often buy stocks on weakness. That\u2019s largely because companies that are great or are on their way to greatness often sink for reasons that are not at all justified.\n\nFor example, on Feb. 21, Super MicroComputer (NASDAQ:SMCI) dropped to as low as $817.08 per share. Many investors wrung their hands about the stock\u2019s valuation, even though it was not expensive, along with the firm\u2019s decision to sell more shares of its stock. Of course, the latter decision ultimately did not greatly affect the company\u2019s fundamentals. Anyone who bought the stock for just above $700 and sold it near its high of $1,033 on Mar. 28, a little over a month later, would have generated a profit of nearly 50% in a little over a month.\n\nSo Buffett\u2019s belief that investors should \u201cbe\u00a0fearful when others are greedy and\u2026 be greedy only when others are fearful\u201d does work. For those who want to profit from that philosophy, here are three stocks to buy on dips.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) mobile phone screen with Enphase Energy (ENPH) logo on it to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), which sells inverters used in solar energy projects, tumbled over 10% on Apr. 5 compared to its highs on the previous day. The catalyst for the downturn was reportedly the decision by Chief Commercial Officer David Ranhoff leaving the firm \u201cfor personal reasons\u201d effective Jun. 30.\n\nBut sometimes executives really do leave firms for personal reasons, and this may be the case for Ranhoof. Moreover, it\u2019s unlikely that Enphase will badly be hurt by the departure of its chief commercial officer. The company probably has many highly capable sales managers who can adequately fill his shoes.\n\nAnd importantly, Nextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) CEO Dan Shugar said in February that \u201csolar is unstoppable\u201d and \u201cthe intrinsic economics of utility scale are phenomenal both in the U.S. and overseas. It has never been as favorable as it is.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEnphase is reeling from the weakness of residential solar in California due to regulatory changes in the state. Also, excess inventories in Europe weigh on the stock. Those issues, though, are expected to be temporary. They should be dwarfed over the longer term by huge increases in the demand for solar energy by utilities.\n\nThese increases will be driven, as I\u2019ve noted in the past, by significant gains in electricity demand. By the end of this year, ENPH stock should be far above its current levels as a result of the latter trend. Consequently, ENPH is one of the best stocks to buy on dips.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe market has penalized Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock after the firm announced on Apr. 2 after the market closed that its manufacturing unit\u2019s operational losses increased to $7 billion last year from $5.2 billion in 2022. Further, the unit\u2019s revenue declined 31% to $18.9 billion. In the wake of the admittedly discouraging news, INTC stock retreated about 15% from recent highs. But CEO Pat Gelsinger explained the firm was remedying bad decisions it had made previously that weighed down the manufacturing business. What\u2019s more, Intel expects the unit\u2019s operating losses to peak this year. Also noteworthy is that it predicted the unit will break even on an operating basis in 2027.\n\nBut the manufacturing unit\u2019s backlog\u00a0now exceeds $15 billion, and it secured a sizeable deal from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). There are also indications that INTC may soon obtain a meaningful commitment from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAs a result, other tech firms impressed by Intel\u2019s ability to win deals from two of the biggest names in the sector may sign contracts as well. I predict within the next 12 months the Street will start to be enamored with Intel again as the manufacturing unit\u2019s backlog grows.\n\nFurther, as I\u2019ve previously noted,\u00a0reviews of the company\u2019s powerful artificial intelligence Gaudi chips have been quite favorable. The chips\u2019 backlog reached over $2 billion by the end of last year. What\u2019s more, the backlog is growing quite rapidly. Intel is expected to launch a greatly improved version of the chip later this year.\n\nAmerican Superconductor (AMSC) A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) sells products used to regulate the flow of electricity. It serves multiple industries whose use of electricity or whose revenues are rapidly increasing.\n\nSpecifically, AMSC has many customers that operate semiconductor plants, and the number of such factories is surging. The sector\u2019s use of electricity is booming as AI proliferates rapidly. Similarly, the company has many customers in the mining and materials sector. That space is growing rapidly as metals prices jump and demand for their use in renewable energy products and electric vehicles rises.\n\nThe shares are down 13% from their March high of $15 and are changing hands at a forward price-sales ratio of three times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in SMCI, INTC, and AMSC. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "The stock market rally continues, with last week\u2019s jobs report sparking a rebound. And just a day after a steep slide, investors may wish to become just a bit more selective.\n\nUndoubtedly, AI is still the name of the game for many gain-hungry investors. The boom is unlikely over. Now, good economic data combines with potentially lower inflation and looming rate cuts. So, we may have an environment where it\u2019ll be tough to stand in the way of the market\u2019s momentum.\n\nEven if there\u2019s plenty of runway for the AI stocks boom to continue, the nearer-term trajectory could prove rougher. Understandably, investors look to book profits and spread bets into lower-cost names that may be next AI home run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s examine a trio of AI stocks that are too hot to buy at current prices.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has arguably been the hottest AI stock of 2024, at least so far. Despite retreating more than 20% from its recent peak, SMCI stock remains up over 230% year to date (YTD). Indeed, the recent bear market flop is a tiny blip, even when looking at the YTD chart!\n\nTrue, new Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI chips, which SMCI is sure to adapt swiftly, act as a nice near-term catalyst. But, I\u2019m simply not comfortable pursuing SMCI stock, given the chart\u2019s unappetizing appeal of recent weeks.\n\nWith a potential head-and-shoulders technical formation that may very well be developing, I\u2019m too scared to be a net buyer here and will stay glued to the sidelines. Shares remain quite frothy at 74.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlso, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shed around 20% of its value since peaking in early March. With more negative momentum this past month than NVDA, as well as a higher trailing P/E ratio, take a \u201craincheck\u201d on AMD. And this is especially relevant if AI stocks are rocked further from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, AMD is a wonderful number-two AI chip titan that cannot be dismissed. With CEO Lisa Su running the show, AMD may be empowered to become even better than most Magnificent Seven companies over the long run. However, in the near term, shares may remain at high risk of a steeper pullback.\n\nPerhaps a better entry point will present itself for patient AI investors. AMD is working hard behind the scenes to maintain (or even advance) its lead in AI acceleration and a potential AI PC boom. In short, AMD\u2019s a great business, but the price is a higher than desirable.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the future. Must-Buy Stocks on Major Deals\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) will likely perform well as the AI boom unfolds in the coming years. After the stock\u2019s recent vertical spike, the big-data juggernaut may be at high risk of a near-term pullback. This is especially true as AI enthusiasm temporarily fades, at least until the next big breakthrough.\n\nFor long-term investors, any further weakness in PLTR stock may serve as a fantastic buying opportunity. With shares down more than 13%, the stock still doesn\u2019t seem cheap enough. Consider that it is fresh off a six-day losing streak.\n\nJust last week, Wall Street analyst Brian White of Monness warned Palantir stock as valuation is excessive. With shares trading at more than 23.7 times price-to-sales, White could be right indeed.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "George Soros\u2019 Favorite Picks: 3 Stocks the Billionaire Keeps Buying",
        "content": "George Soros\u2019 hedge fund is making big bets on stocks, though not nearly as big as those he made on global currencies. His biggest investment had been Splunk, a big data analytics firm. He owned 1.6 million shares worth $240 million, representing over 4.5% of the hedge fund\u2019s total portfolio. However, Cisco just acquired the company last month (NASDAQ:CSCO). With an average buy price of around $141 per share, Soros has made a decent profit on the $157 per share acquisition price.\n\nWhat follows are the next three biggest George Soros stocks held in Soros Fund Management according to the latest 13F filing with the SEC.\n\niShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) An investor's analyzing the russell 2000 etf fund on a screen. A phone shows the prices of Russell 2000. russell 2000 stocks\n\nSource: Maurice NORBERT / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoros is also gambling on small-cap stocks, which is making a strong comeback. He owns 1.2 million shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), the index that charts the 2,000 smallest stocks in the Russell 3000 index.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to believe Soros is on the right track. Historically speaking, small-cap stocks handily outperform mid and large-cap stocks. In their book Investing in Small Cap Stocks, authors Christopher Graja and Elizabeth Ungar found that over the 75 years studied, small-cap stocks beat mid-cap and large-cap stocks 60% of the time. Small-caps have underperformed their larger brethren, but beginning last October, that began to change, and today, the Russell 2000 is edging higher than the S&P 500.\n\nWhile the small-cap index does hold many tiny companies with market valuations in just the tens of millions of dollars, it also holds some large ones that stretch the definition of \u201csmall-cap.\u201d The largest stock in the index is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), with a market cap of $55.5 billion. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is the next biggest with a $24 billion valuation. As those two stocks have been amongst the market\u2019s top performers over the past year, it\u2019s unsurprising to see the iShares Russell 2000 ETF also doing well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAerCap Holdings (AER) image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith an $18 billion market valuation, AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER) isn\u2019t quite a small-cap stock either. But it is having a solid run higher. Shares are up 18% year to date and 57% higher over the last 12 months.\n\nThe Irish aircraft leasing company capped a strong year with fourth-quarter revenue of $1.9 billion. However, that was just slightly under Wall Street\u2019s forecast for $1.92 billion. Earnings, though, easily trounced projections, coming in at $3.11 per share versus a $2.45 per share consensus view.\n\nSoros Fund Management owns almost 2.5 million shares at an average buy-in price of just under $63 per share. That values his stake at $183.5 million, which is good for a 3.5% position in his hedge fund, with the stock trading at around $88 per share, which gives Soros a 40% gain on his holdings so far.\n\nWall Street\u2019s price target aligns with that valuation, but analysts see AerCap rising to $101 per share on the high side. The aircraft leasing company could go higher. CEO Aengus Kelly said, \u201cGiven the strong tailwinds that we see for demand for aircraft, engines and helicopters, we are confident about the outlook for AerCap in 2024 and beyond.\u201d\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe third stock Soros is making a large bet on is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), which holds a 3.2% position in Soros Fund Management. He owns 1.2 million shares worth $170.3 million. The tech giant is not one of his best performers, though. The tech giant\u2019s shares are down 13% from his average buy price of $97.\n\nAlphabet has some mixed reviews from hedge fund operators. I noted two weeks ago that Jim Simons at Renaissance Technologies was buying the stock. Still, Paul Tudor Jones from Tudor Investments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundationsold off their respective stakes.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to bet against Alphabet, though. Google remains a monopoly in search of all but names only, with a 91% market share. Although Alphabet\u2019s advertising revenue disappointed Wall Street earlier this year, it is also an election year. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be dumped into ad campaigns. Google will grab a large portion of those ad dollars.\n\nAlso, Google Cloud is a fast-growing rival to Amazon\u2018s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft\u2018s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. It has outpaced both of them for several quarters, with other irons in the fire, including Waymo self-driving vehicles. Alphabet should not be counted out by any means.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.94 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 7, 2024.\n\nSMCI has an Earnings ESP figure of 16.35%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $6.94 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.97.\n\nSMCI is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Carrier Global (CARR).\n\nCarrier Global, which is readying to report earnings on April 25, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Super Micro Computer Next?",
        "content": "It seems everyone loves a stock split. Sure, they don't change a company's fundamentals. Similar to the way you cut up a pizza doesn't change the overall size of the pizza, a stock split doesn't change a company's overall value. But it can make getting a slice easier for more hungry investors.\n\nOne of the hottest stocks of 2024, SuperMicroComputer (NASDAQ: SMCI), has cooled off recently as shares have become quite expensive. Could a stock split help this formerly red-hot name spark renewed interest? Let's explore the situation and see if an answer presents itself. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat does Super Micro Computer do?\n\nLet's start with the basics: Super Micro Computer, or Supermicro (as it is also known), is in the business of making high-performance computing equipment. Specifically, the company makes server racks, cooling systems, and other physical hardware necessary for the creation and management of advanced computing systems.\n\nBasically, this company makes the things you buy when you want to build or expand a data center or supercomputer. Its server racks are ideal for holding graphics processing units (GPUs), the brains behind today's advanced artificial intelligence (AI). And since the top supercomputers and data centers use hundreds of thousands -- even millions -- of these GPUs, business is booming for Supermicro.\n\nAnalysts expect the company's revenue to skyrocket in the coming years, with the consensus predicting 2024 revenue will rise 106% to $14.7 billion and 2025 revenue will increase a further 41% to $20.7 billion.\n\nIs now the time for a stock split?\n\nAs of this writing, Supermicro shares trade for around $965. Less than a year ago, they were trading for about $94. In under a year, Supermicro stock has grown 10x. That, my friends, is a 10-bagger.\n\nThis rapid growth and the now very high stock price (compared to the average stock out there) have some suggesting that now is the time for Supermicro's board of directors to initiate a stock split.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that response isn't so simple.\n\nFirst, some reasons why a split helps. Retail investors often lose interest when a stock reaches a certain price threshold, say above $400. It becomes a psychological barrier, regardless of whether the barrier is truly justified. Many retail investors can't afford to buy whole shares if the price rises too high and that seems to matter (despite the viable alternative of buying partial shares). For others, portfolio diversification becomes difficult. Whatever their reasons, some retail investors shy away from high-priced stocks, and boards of directors know this. That's why they often perform stock splits when their companies' stock prices become elevated.\n\nThere are also valid reasons to delay or not perform a split. Perhaps the board thinks the stock price will eventually decrease, meaning a reverse stock split might follow a stock split. Reverse splits can have a psychological effect on investors too and cause a selling spree. Also, lowering the stock price makes it more susceptible to day traders, and the volatility they can bring with them. Moreover, stock splits cost the company money to execute. Granted, it's not a ton of money, but companies might incur six-figure fees from exchanges, plus legal and regulatory hurdles and costs.\n\nIs a stock split coming?\n\nThere are pros and cons for a potential stock split for Supermicro. On the one hand, shares now trade for over $1,000, which undoubtedly depletes some level of retail investor interest. Nevertheless, the company's leadership may not be ready to initiate a stock split yet, given how quickly the company's shares have risen in value.\n\nIn the final analysis, I believe Supermicro will split its shares, although it may take months -- or perhaps longer -- before it happens.\n\nNevertheless, stock split or not, Supermicro remains a stock that growth investors should keep a close eye on, given its explosive potential. It's not a stock for every portfolio, but considering how quickly the overall AI market is growing, Supermicro's future looks very bright.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recorded more than 220% returns in the last twelve months, mainly due to the AI explosion. The company\u2019s upward trajectory could be running out of steam.\n\nHigh-profile investors are starting to cash out. The company\u2019s old rivals, like Intel, are also starting to produce AI chips. The then-GPU maker is now facing significant competition as everyone wants a piece of the market. And it will only get tighter going forward.\u00a0This is why some investors seek stocks offering better growth than Nvidia.\n\nSo with a market brimming with tech companies touting AI-adjacent products and services, how can one make a decent pick? I think it\u2019s wiser to look into companies with tried-and-tested formulas or ones that present a compelling picture of their future, like these three.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has come a long way and become a tech powerhouse. It\u2019s mostly known as the alternative to Nvidia in the GPU market and Intel in the CPU market.The company\u2019s operation data center segment oversees its key products. Those include its server CPUs, AI accelerators, graphic processing units and accelerated processing units.\n\nAlso, AMD\u2019s latest Instict MI300X GPUs are seeing market exposure. Late last year, Microsoft announced that it would use the chip for its accelerated virtual machines. This can be another growth avenue for AMD.\n\nMeanwhile, 2023 was a slight off-year for the company. Full-year revenue and gross profit decreased 4% and 1%, respectively. Fiscal year 2024 predictions also remain flat to negative, which might not incite much confidence from investors.\n\nAdditionally, AMD is playing catch-up with Intel and Nvidia regarding market share for CPUs and GPUs/data centers. However, the company is no stranger to this position. It has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to recover with significant market share boosts.\n\nStory continues\n\nRyzen\u2019s launch is a testament to that, boosting AMD CPU coverage from the low 20s to nearly 40% in half a decade.\u00a0On the AI front, the company is expanding its offerings, including announcing the Ryzen 8040 Series mobile CPU and the Ryzen 8000G Series for desktops. Both are integrated with neural processing units for AI workload acceleration.\n\nWhile most investors wouldn\u2019t see it winning head-to-head with Nvidia right now, its promise for growth is a different story.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGPU and CPU chips aren\u2019t the only things in demand. External memory chips are also crucial, especially for larger neural networks. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is tackling the AI boom with its high-performance memory products and is a leader in memory and storage solutions.\n\nIts HBM3E memory helps accelerate the growth of AI with its lightning-fast data access of 1.2 terabytes per second bandwidth. It operates at a 30% lower power consumption than other competitive offerings. HB3ME is so good that it has sold out its supply for 2024 and most of its 2025 supply, signifying its product\u2019s superiority to its market competition.\n\nFurther, the company\u2019s products were so well received that it reached revenue of $5.82 billion for Q2 of 2024. That is significantly higher than its $3.69 billion for the same year-ago quarter. GAAP net income ended at $793 million, a turnaround from its previous year\u2019s GAAP net loss of $2.31 billion.\n\n\u201cMicron delivered fiscal Q2 results with revenue, gross margin and EPS well above the high-end of our guidance range \u2014 a testament to our team\u2019s excellent execution on pricing, products and operations,\u201d said Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO.\n\nFinally, MU anticipates continued growth, driven by the demand for AI and tight supply dynamics in the semiconductor industry. The company is still on the road to recovery after its massive ban from China last year. So, if you are in the market for stocks offering better growth prospects than Nvidia, this is it.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMostly known as Supermicro, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a high-performance server specialist that offers application-optimized servers and storage systems for various enterprises.\n\nWhile the company may not be as big as Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise on a global scale, it is uniquely positioned due to its long-standing partnership with Nvidia for its dedicated AI servers and the wave it brings in the growing trend.\n\nWhile some may think that Supermicro is riding the coattails of the GPU giant, I certainly disagree. Its application-optimized servers and Nvidia GPUs help pre-trained models fine-tune and improve decision-making and response times for AI inference solutions.\n\nThis was a strong combination, as its latest quarterly financials reported a 103% year over year (YOY) growth in net sales, which amounted to $3.66 billion.\n\nAlso, SMCI\u2019s net income reached $296 million, nearly double that of the previous year. CEO Charles Liang attributes the company\u2019s exceptional performance to the increasing demand for its AI computer platforms and Total IT Solutions.\n\nIn terms of outlook, SMCI expects revenue for fiscal year 2024 to be between $14.3 billion and $14.7 billion, adjusted higher from the previous announcement. With its strong growth and robust AI product offerings, it\u2019s no wonder investors view SMCI as one of the stocks offering better growth than Nvidia.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Dell vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "The market for artificial intelligence (AI) servers has taken off in the past year as cloud companies and data center providers pour money into building their AI infrastructure and developing generative AI applications. This explains why server manufacturers such as Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have seen their share prices explode.\n\nWhile Dell's stock price has nearly tripled in the past year, Supermicro, as it is also known, has shot up a whopping 873%. But what's surprising is that both companies continue to trade at attractive valuations despite their stunning stock price surges in the past year.\n\nSo if you had to buy one of these two AI server plays right now, which one would be a better bet? Let's find out.\n\nThe case for Dell Technologies\n\nDell Technologies is the leading player in the global server market. The company's share of the overall server market reportedly stood at 19% at the end of 2022, as per third-party estimates. So it is not surprising to see why the company benefits from the growing demand for AI servers.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Feb. 29, 2024), Dell reported that orders for AI-optimized servers increased almost 40% quarter over quarter. The company sold $800 million worth of AI servers last quarter. This figure should continue to move higher, as Dell's AI server backlog almost doubled quarter over quarter to $2.9 billion. With the AI server market forecasted to clock annual revenue of $150 billion in 2027 compared to $30 billion last year, there is a lot of space for Dell to grow in this market.\n\nIt is worth noting that AI servers currently form a small part of Dell's overall business. The company delivered $22.3 billion in revenue in fiscal Q4, down 11% year over year. The year-over-year decline can be attributed to Dell's client solutions segment, through which it sells personal computers (PCs) and workstations.\n\nThe PC market was not in great health last year, with shipments dropping almost 14% from 2022. This explains why Dell's client solutions revenue was down 12% year over year in the previous quarter. The good news is that this segment could return to growth in 2024 thanks to the adoption of AI-enabled PCs. Market research firm Canalys expects shipments of AI-enabled PCs to jump from 48 million units this year to 205 million units annually in 2028.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo Dell has two lucrative AI-related catalysts that are likely to help it return to growth from the current fiscal year. The company delivered $88.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, down 14% from the prior year. However, as the following chart shows, its revenue is set to start growing from fiscal 2025. DELL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe case for Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a much smaller company than Dell. Its revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended in June last year) was just $7.1 billion. However, being smaller means that sales of AI servers are moving the needle in a bigger way for Supermicro.\n\nThe company got more than 50% of its total revenue from selling AI-related server solutions in the previous quarter. This explains why the company's revenue in the current fiscal year is on track to more than double to $14.5 billion. If half of Supermicro's fiscal 2024 revenue comes from sales of AI servers, it would generate at least $7.2 billion in sales from this fast-growing market. That translates into a greater quarterly AI server revenue run rate compared to Dell.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Supermicro could double its revenue from current levels given that it has expanded its manufacturing operations to support more than $25 billion in annual revenue. The company is witnessing a quick rise in the utilization rates of its current manufacturing capacity. Supermicro management said on the January earnings conference call that \"our production utilization rate is about 65% across our USA, Netherlands and Taiwan facilities, and they are quickly filling.\"\n\nAs such, it is not surprising to see why consensus estimates are expecting Supermicro's top-line growth to remain solid in fiscal 2024 and beyond. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising to see Supermicro exceeding the fiscal 2026 consensus estimate. That's because, in management's words, \"next-generation AI and CPU platforms continue to drive strong levels of design wins, orders and backlog from top-tier data centers, emerging cloud service providers, enterprise/channel, and edge/IoT/telco customers.\"\n\nThe verdict\n\nI have already pointed out that Supermicro's smaller size is an advantage, as the demand for its AI servers is driving much stronger growth compared to Dell. This explains why analysts forecast Supermicro's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 48% for the next five years. Dell, meanwhile, is expected to clock nearly negligible annual earnings growth for the next five years.\n\nOf course, Dell's fortunes could change, and its earnings growth rate could accelerate once its AI server business becomes bigger and AI-enabled PCs start driving growth in the client business. That's why investors looking for a potential AI winner trading at an attractive valuation might want to consider buying Dell, as it is trading at just 15.7 times forward earnings, lower than Supermicro's forward earnings multiple of 36.\n\nHowever, we have seen that Supermicro is growing at a much faster pace, and it can justify its richer valuation as a result.

        "title": "Stock Split Watch: Could Super Micro Computer Be Next?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is a key behind-the-scenes player in the potential artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company makes the servers, storage systems, and full rack scale solutions needed by AI projects -- and demand for these products has been climbing, supercharging the company's earnings.\n\nThis job in the shadows has put Supermicro in the spotlight in recent times as investors search for possible AI winners -- leading the shares to skyrocket. In fact, Supermicro stock has soared more than 700% over the past year and recently surpassed $1,000 before pulling back to just under that level. When stocks start approaching the $1,000 mark, the natural question often is: Will the company announce a stock split? So, today, it's natural to wonder if such an operation may be the next move for this top AI player. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy a stock split is a good idea\n\nFirst, let's talk a little bit about why a stock split may be a good idea. A stock split involves a company offering more shares to current shareholders to bring down the price of each individual share. The market value of the company and the value of your holding remain the same -- but the price of each share will be lower according to the ratio of the split.\n\nSo, for example, if a company announces a 10-for-1 stock split, and the original price of the stock is $1,000, after the operation the stock will be priced at $100 -- and if you originally held one share, you now would own 10.\n\nThe advantage of a split -- for the company and for investors -- is it makes the stock more accessible for a broader range of investors. Yes, investors can get in on a high-priced stock through fractional shares, but some brokerages don't offer them. And some investors simply prefer investing in at least one full share. This means a stock split could encourage more investors to take a position in a particular company.\n\nAll of this means a stock split could be a great move for Supermicro. But will it happen? History doesn't offer us a clue. Supermicro has never split its stock before, but it didn't have to -- as recently as 2018, the stock traded for a little more than $10.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month, Supermicro made a move that actually resulted in a dip in its share price, pushing it down from its record high. The company announced the sale of 2 million shares and aims to use proceeds to support regular operations such as buying inventory and boosting research spending. Since, Supermicro shares have recouped some losses, but haven't yet returned to $1,000 territory.\n\nSupermicro's business is booming\n\nStill, Supermicro's business is booming, and the next earnings report or other positive sales news could spur additional gains for the stock. In the most recent report, the company announced its first $3 billion quarter ever. Supermicro saw ongoing record demand for AI systems at rack scale and said the AI boom may continue for years to come.\n\nThis tech player closely tracks new releases of products from top chip companies such as Nvidia and Intel so that they can be immediately integrated into Supermicro's systems. And this means recent and upcoming launches from these players -- such as Nvidia's announcement of its Blackwell architecture and chips later this year -- should spur sales gains at Supermicro, too.\n\nSo, there's plenty of reason to believe Supermicro's shares could be heading back to $1,000 and beyond. At that level or even at today's price of more than $900, Supermicro makes a great candidate for a stock split. These operations generally don't result in share price gains for a company -- since they're mechanical movements and don't change the company's fundamentals. But making a particular stock more accessible for a broad audience is positive, and this accessibility could help the stock progress over time.\n\nI don't think Supermicro will announce a split right this moment as management still may be focused on the recent share sale, but it could be one of the company's next moves -- especially if the stock continues to gain ground in the coming weeks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 unstoppable tech stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the technology industry, go directly to the 5 Unstoppable Tech Stocks To Buy.\n\nThe technology sector experienced significant growth in 2023 after a disastrous preceding year. Over the last year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has been up 33.78% compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 25.84% gains at the time of writing on April 4. The industry ETFs have also received significant attention from investors. The growing trajectory of artificial intelligence (AI) significantly propelled the performance of VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW), and Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF Shares (VGT) have become some of thebest-performing ETFs in the market. iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) and Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF Shares (VGT) have realized gains of 45.31% and 35.52% over the last twelve months, as of April 4, respectively. While these two ETFs are mostly moving in line with the broader market since the start of the year, VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) seems to be an unstoppable tech ETF that has gained 73.72% over the last twelve months and 30.14% year-to-date, compared to S&P 500\u2019s 8.53% YTD gains, as of April 4.\n\nBeneficiaries of the AI Trend\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the top names that are set to benefit from the AI revolution. The company\u2019s AI offerings include Firefly, Adobe Express, Lightroom, and several others. At Adobe Summit 2024, held between March 25 and 28, the company revealed a range of groundbreaking innovations aimed at revolutionizing how enterprises deliver personalized experiences at scale. The company introduced Adobe Experience Platform AI Assistant, which aims to streamline tasks and provide insights through a conversational interface. Adobe Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:ADBE) new offering, GenStudio, is a content creation and management platform that uses generative AI to plan, create, manage, activate, and measure on-brand content for marketing teams. The platform allows marketing teams to produce high-quality, personalized content at scale. Anil Chakravarthy, President, Digital Experience Business at the company said:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Generative AI enables a fundamental shift in the relationship between brands and their customers, creating a transformative moment for business leaders to drive profitable growth while delivering new digital experiences\u201d\n\nHe further added:\n\n\"The ability to personalize every interaction has become the key growth driver in Customer Experience Management for enterprises around the world, and Adobe is leading the way in making this a reality with powerful generative AI deeply integrated into existing workflows.\"\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported its first quarter 2024 earnings on March 14 and registered double-digit revenue growth at $5.18 billion, up 11% year-over-year. The company\u2019s net income declined by 50% year-over-year to $620 million and was mostly affected by the termination of the Figma deal. On September 15, 2023, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) announced its plan to acquire the software developer Figma Inc. for $20 billion. The deal fell through as it was blocked by the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority, and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) had to pay Figma a $1 billion termination fee. At its Q1 2024 earnings call, the company\u2019s CFO, Daniel J. Durn, said that the payment has caused the company\u2019s GAAP EPS to come in $2.19 lower, and this will affect the full-year EPS as well.\n\nThe advanced computing power required for AI is a significant growth catalyst for semiconductor companies. While most of the semiconductor industry depends on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) for chip manufacturing, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) hopes to compete with the company in the near future. The company\u2019s foundry business reported operating losses of $7 billion in 2023 on an $18.9 billion revenue. The company expects its foundry to reach profitability somewhere at the mid-point of 2023 and 2030. Nevertheless, disruptive technologies such as AI, autonomous driving, and electric vehicles are expected to drive the chip demand much higher over the next few years, which makes a bull case for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). The company is aiming to become the second largest external foundry by 2030 as the company\u2019s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, made the following comments at the company\u2019s Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n\u201cWhile our ambitions will not materialize overnight, we made tremendous progress in both Q4 and fiscal year '23 toward our goal of becoming the second-largest external foundry by 2030. The rapid adoption of AI by all industries is proving to be a significant tailwind for IFS as high-performance compute, an area where we have considerable wafer and packaging know-how and IP is now one of the largest and fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor market. We made major strides in building our foundry ecosystem in 2023 with now over 40 strategic agreements across EDA design services, IP, cloud, and U.S. military aerospace and government.\n\nCritical agreements with ARM and Synopsys continue to gain momentum. We delivered the Intel 18A 0.9 PDK and broadened its availability in Q4. We expanded the RAMP-C program significantly and just this quarter signed a major foundry contract with the United States government and Department of Defense. We are also very pleased to have completed a major agreement with United Microelectronics, or UMC, to develop a 12-nanometer process platform targeting high-growth markets, including mobile, communication infrastructure, and networking.\n\nThis expands both Intel and UMC's foundry process portfolios and customer access to a broader and more resilient supply leveraging our Arizona site. This agreement builds upon and furthers our long and deep relationships with the vibrant Taiwan ecosystem. This also meaningfully extends the production life of our installed capacity and improves our returns on investments, similar to the announcement last quarter of our Tower Semiconductor partnership at the 65-nanometer node with our New Mexico site. Our success with IFS will be measured by customer commitments and revenue.\u201d\n\nThe technology sector has been the recent market winner and seems to have tons of growth potential in the long term as well. Keeping that in mind, some unstoppable tech stocks to buy include Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), and AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP). 10 Unstoppable Tech Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify large to mega-cap technology stocks with year-to-date gains of over 35%, as of April 4.

        "title": "Is Nvidia or Super Micro Computer the Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock?",
        "content": "In the world of artificial intelligence (AI) investing, few stocks have been better recently than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). These two have had a phenomenal 2024 so far, with Super Micro Computer (often called Supermicro) up over 250% and Nvidia up by 80%.\n\nBut that performance becomes even more impressive if you backdate to the start of 2023, as Supermciro and Nvidia are up an astounding 1,160% and 520%, respectively. That level of performance might have investors wondering if there's room for more. If there is, the next obvious question is, \"Which one should I buy?\"\n\nSo, between the two, which is the better AI stock to buy today? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia and Supermicro work together\n\nThese two companies aren't competitors; they are complementary. Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) -- computing hardware that specializes in effectively processing intense calculations. These devices have been used for gaming graphics, engineering simulations, cryptocurrency mining, AI model training, and practically every other use that would require significant computing power to process.\n\nFortunately for Nvidia, most users (besides gamers) don't just have a single GPU. They buy hundreds or thousands of them and connect them to form supercomputers often housed in servers at a data center.\n\nHowever, haphazardly linking them together will not result in an optimized computing experience, which is where Supermicro comes in.\n\nSupermicro specializes in server design and has separated itself from competitors by offering highly customizable products that can be designed for workload type and size. Furthermore, Supermicro works closely with Nvidia to ensure its servers have been designed in an optimized manner so the end-user gets the most use out of their product.\n\nThis brings up the first difference: Supermicro has less differentiating technology. While Nvidia's GPUs are market-leading, Supermicro relies on industry knowledge and customization to separate itself from competitors. This can be a sustainable advantage, but it's less sustainable than having superior technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother difference is that Supermicro is essentially an Nvidia reseller. It takes Nvidia's GPUs and other components to make its servers and then sells them to its clients. Because it cannot control the GPU pricing (the most significant cost of the server), Supermicro's margins are much slimmer than Nvidia's. SMCI Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nOnce again, this is just a differentiating factor. Plenty of businesses have succeeded with much lower margins.\n\nBut when it all adds up, my lean starts to go in Nvidia's direction due to its technological prowess and higher margins. Additionally, when I look at each stock's valuation, Nvidia also looks to have an advantage there.\n\nSupermicro's stock has gotten very expensive\n\nAfter these two stocks' incredible runs, valuing them can be difficult. Trailing metrics aren't useful, as they are still undergoing massive changes (both Supermicro and Nvidia grew revenue by over 100% in their latest results). As a result, I'll use a forward-facing metric like the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value the companies.\n\nForward metrics have their issues, as they utilize analyst projections to value a company, which isn't an exact science. Still, it's arguably the best way to value these businesses, but Supermicro certainly comes with a price premium over Nvidia on this basis. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis makes sense, as Supermicro's boom is just beginning, while Nvidia's is starting to mature (even though Wall Street analysts project nearly 100% revenue growth this year).\n\nWith Nvidia's stock trading at a lower level (and thus lower expectations to meet) than Supermicro's, I think there's no doubt that Nvidia is the superior AI stock. That's not to say that Supermicro is a bad stock, as it will likely continue to succeed due to its strong product offering and customization. However, the valuation bar is a bit higher for Supermicro, so I'm giving the nod to Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund is considered a benchmark for the tech industry, which has grown by 37% within the last year. The ever-advancing field of generative AI and other innovative technology, such as cloud computing and increased semiconductor production, has led the technology industry down a path of immense profitability.\n\nHere are a few investment options within the tech industry that have performed very well recently. They are also strong buy stocks that could continue to grow throughout 2024.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is primarily a technology infrastructure company that offers storage and server systems such as full racks, blade servers, security software, subsystems, and rack-mount servers. Its products are used in data centers, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market over the past year, growing nearly ninefold during that time due to increased earnings growth and a surge of investors flocking to companies that provide new and innovative tech, especially within the cloud computing and generative AI industries.\n\nOn Jan. 29, SMCI released its earnings for the\u00a0second quarter of fiscal year 2024, in which it stated that total revenue more than doubled to $3.7 billion, and net income rose by 68% compared to the previous year. Management reported that the anticipated revenue for SMCI in the third quarter of FY 2024 is between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion.\n\nEarlier last month, it was announced that Super Micro Computer would be\u00a0added to the S&P 500 following its scheduled rebalance. SMCI replaced Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR). This move further legitimizes Super Micro Computer as a strong company with further upside potential, which makes it a great option for investors in 2024, even after its impressive share price growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAppLovin (APP) AppLovin (APP) logo and page displayed on phone and computer screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nAppLovin (NADSAQ:APP) is an application software company that provides an advertising infrastructure platform with products such as MAX, Spark, AppDiscovery, SparkLabs, Array, and Adjust.\n\nSimilar to SMCI, AppLovin has received plenty of positive attention for its involvement in innovation within the generative AI space, which has brought tremendous growth.\n\nOn Feb. 14, APP repotted earnings results for the\u00a0fourth quarter of the full year 2023, in which it stated that it beat analyst expectations for total revenue, which increased by 36% year-over-year. Its earnings per share were forty-nine cents per share, which beat by fourteen cents per share. In a press release, AppLovin reported a secondary offering of common stock by KKR Denali Holdings of nearly 20 million shares. It has also announced a share buyback program of $570 million worth of shares.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has more than quadrupled, with continued growth expected due to its strong positioning within the rapidly growing tech industry. It is a solid pick for investors looking for greater exposure within companies that have profited heavily from the expansion of generative AI.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a producer of semiconductor-related equipment. It offers wafer cleaning equipment and electrochemical plating technology.\n\nACM Research is still surprisingly considered an undervalued company, especially in the realm of many other semiconductor-related stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which have experienced growing popularity and a large increase in overall share price.\n\nOn Feb. 28, it reported earnings for the\u00a0fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, which stated that net income increased by 64% year-over-year. ACMR also beat analyst predictions for revenue by $21 million and earnings per share by twenty-six cents per share.\n\nACM Research is a strong buy stock within the semiconductor industry. Its share price has more than doubled within this last year, primarily due to its outstanding earnings report for the fourth quarter, which immediately, upon release, propelled its share price by over 40%. It is poised for continued growth with revenue guidance for the full year 2024 of between $650 million and $750 million, topping the full-year 2023 results of $558 million by at least 17%.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton held a LONG position\u00a0in APP.

        "content": "By now, most investors know that artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are dominating the stock market.\n\nAI has emerged as the key theme driving the new bull market, and it's already created a number of big winners, including Nvidia, the maker of the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are the foundation of AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nMost of the top CEOs in the tech industry think the AI revolution is still in its early innings, meaning many of the stocks that have already surged should keep gaining. Keep reading to see two AI stocks that doubled in the past year and could do so again. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nThere's doubling in a year, and then there's doing what Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has done.\n\nShares of the maker of high-density servers that work especially well for AI applications have jumped more than 800% over the past year, fueled by soaring demand for its servers and storage solutions.\n\nWhile you might think that it would be impossible for a stock like that to double again, there are a number of reasons Supermicro, as the company is also known, could jump another 100%.\n\nFirst, Supermicro's business is soaring, with revenue up 103% in its most recent quarter, and even faster growth is projected over the remaining half of its fiscal year. Sales are doubling in spite of supply shortages as the company works closely with Nvidia to build customizable servers for its AI customers.\n\nCEO Charles Liang said on the most recent earnings call that demand is still outstripping supply and that the company would be able to ship more product if supply improves -- and it is improving. Management also said that guidance was conservative because it is supply constrained, meaning that it could easily beat its guidance if its access to Nvidia's GPUs improves.\n\nThe stock also looks reasonably priced at a price-to-earnings ratio of 45 based on fiscal 2024's earnings estimates.\n\nIf Supermicro can outperform its guidance and stay ahead of the competition, the stock could have a lot of room to run. Doubling isn't out of the question, considering how fast Supermicro is growing and how large the opportunity in generative AI is.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Micron\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), which is best known for making DRAM and NAND memory chips, has also soared over the last year. Its stock hasn't gone parabolic the way Supermicro's has, but shares of Micron are still up 103% over the past year.\n\nMicron should benefit from a number of tailwinds over the next year that could help the stock double again.\n\nFirst, it is starting to emerge from a downturn in the chip sector as the pandemic-driven boom in PCs, tablets, and gaming systems turned into a supply glut and falling prices in 2022 and 2023. Micron's recent second-quarter earnings report showed it has clearly turned the corner.\n\nRevenue jumped 58% to $5.8 billion, and Micron flipped a wide loss in the year-ago quarter to an operating profit of $191 million. The company also called out AI as a key demand driver as CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said, \"We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multiyear opportunity enabled by AI.\"\n\nAs Mehrotra explained on the earnings call, surging demand for AI servers is driving growth in high-bandwidth memory and data center solid-state drives, which is tightening the supply of memory chips, leading to increased prices for Micron's products.\n\nIt expects that trend to continue and is forecasting record revenue in fiscal 2025 with a significant improvement in profitability.\n\nMicron is still cheaper than most other AI chip stocks, and if it can ramp up sales and take advantage of rising demand, the stock should continue moving higher. Considering the stock's breakout has only recently begun, putting up another double is within Micron's reach.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Hardware Stocks -- Not Named Nvidia -- That Are Crushing the Market and Are Still Cheap",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have taken off big-time in the past year. The\u00a0PHLX Semiconductor Sector index gained an impressive 51% during this period thanks to the booming chip demand triggered by the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nSemiconductors play a central role in the AI revolution. The training of AI models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT was made possible using chips designed by the likes of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). This explains why Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have been selling like hotcakes over the past 18 months, leading to a sharp jump in Nvidia's revenue and earnings. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe market rewarded Nvidia handsomely for its stellar growth. That's evident from the 225% jump in the company's stock price in the past year. It won't be surprising to see Nvidia maintain its outstanding momentum as well thanks to expectations of strong top- and bottom-line growth. However, Nvidia is not the only company in the hardware supply chain driving the AI revolution.\n\nHere's a closer look at five other names playing a central role in the AI hardware market.\n\nThese server manufacturers are winning big from AI adoption\n\nWhile the likes of Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices make or design chips that are used for addressing AI workloads such as training large language models (LLMs) and for inferencing purposes, those chips need to be mounted on a server infrastructure that's specifically designed for running AI workloads. Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) are two names benefiting big-time from the growing need for AI-optimized servers.\n\nWhile shares of Dell have jumped 184% in the past year, Supermicro stock has rocketed higher, with eye-popping gains of 847%. Despite these massive jumps, both stocks still trade at attractive multiples. Dell has a sales multiple of just 0.9, while Supermicro's reading stands at 5.6. Their sales multiples are lower than the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's average price-to-sales ratio of 7.3.\n\nStory continues\n\nA closer look at how AI drives their growth will demonstrate why investors bought their stocks hand over fist in the past year. It also explains why they are still worth buying. Dell, for instance, is set to return to growth in the current fiscal year after struggling in the previous one because of weak personal computer (PC) sales.\n\nIts top line fell 14% in fiscal 2024 (which ended on Feb. 2, 2024) to $88.4 billion. Dell has guided for $93 billion in revenue in the current year at the midpoint of its guidance range, and the demand for AI servers is one of the reasons behind its turnaround. Dell shipped $800 million worth of AI-optimized servers last quarter. Even better, its AI server backlog almost doubled quarter over quarter to $2.9 billion thanks to a 40% sequential increase in AI server orders.\n\nThe good part is that Dell's AI server order book could keep getting fatter. The AI server market is set to grow from an estimated $30 billion last year to $150 billion in 2027, according to Foxconn. This is precisely the reason why even Super Micro Computer stock has turned out to be a stock market favorite in the past year.\n\nSupermicro's growth has been stunning with its revenue in the ongoing fiscal year 2024 set to double to $14.5 billion from $7.1 billion in fiscal 2023. More importantly, the server manufacturer claims that its production capacity is solid enough to support more than $25 billion in annual revenue. This explains why analysts have significantly raised their revenue estimates for the next couple of years. However, it won't be surprising to see the company crushing those expectations thanks to its capacity expansion moves. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nMemory and custom chips also saw a robust AI-driven boom\n\nMemory chips from the likes of Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) are helping Nvidia manufacture powerful AI GPUs. This explains why Micron sold out its entire 2024 capacity of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips that are deployed in AI chips, while also allocating an \"overwhelming majority\" of its HBM production line for next year.\n\nHBM is deployed to increase the speed at which data is fed to AI processors, significantly boosting the performance of AI processors. This explains why Nvidia and AMD have been packing more HBM into their AI chips, driving impressive growth for Micron. The memory specialist's revenue was up 58% year over year last quarter to $5.8 billion. It is expecting stronger growth of 76% in revenue in the current quarter to $6.6 billion from $3.75 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect Micron to finish the year with a 57% spike in revenue to $24.3 billion followed by another impressive year in fiscal 2025 with an estimated revenue jump of 42%. With shares of Micron currently trading at 6.4 times sales despite rising 95% in the past year, buying it looks like a smart thing to do as the HBM market could generate $49 billion in annual revenue in 2030 as compared to $857 million last year.\n\nAnother chipmaker benefiting from the AI chip market is Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), a stock that has jumped 106% in the past year. In February, J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur pointed out that Broadcom is set to become the second-largest AI chip company in 2024 with an estimated revenue of $8 billion to $9 billion thanks to customers such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms for whom it makes custom AI chips.\n\nBut when Broadcom released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results, management said that its AI chip revenue is set to exceed $10 billion in the current fiscal year. However, don't be surprised to see Broadcom exceeding that mark as it recently added a new customer for its custom AI chips. Wall Street analysts believe that the newly added customer could be Amazon, Apple, or TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\nIt is easy to see why Broadcom's AI customer pipeline is increasing. Cloud companies are looking to develop custom chips for running AI workloads to reduce costs, consume less power, and improve performance. This explains why Morgan Stanley predicts custom chips will account for 30% of the $182 billion AI semiconductor market in 2027, indicating that Broadcom's addressable market in AI chips could be worth almost $55 billion in three years.\n\nSo, Broadcom's AI business could keep growing at a nice clip moving forward, which is why buying the stock now could be a good idea as it is trading at 28 times forward earnings, in line with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple and lower than Nvidia's reading of 36.\n\nThe bonus pick\n\nAll the above-mentioned names supply AI hardware, but it eventually comes down to electronics manufacturing services providers such as Jabil(NYSE: JBL) to make the end products. This stock is trading up 52% in the past year but recently took a big hit. Savvy investors, however, would do well to take a look at the bigger picture.\n\nFrom designing and sourcing components to assembling the final product, Jabil products and services are deployed to reduce costs and enhance efficiency. Not surprisingly, Jabil saw a big surge in AI-related orders. Management pointed out on its recent earnings conference call that its \"AI GPU volume in the first half of 2024 is 200x that of the level of 2023.\"\n\nEven better, Jabil points out that its AI-related revenue is set to increase by 20% in fiscal 2025 to $6 billion. That would be 20% of the company's top line based on the consensus estimate of $30 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025.\n\nJabil's AI business could keep growing in the future as the company claims that it is \"winning share across multiple end markets in the AI data center infrastructure space.\" That's why investors would do well to take a closer look at this AI stock that's trading at just 0.5 times sales and 21 times trailing earnings before it steps on the gas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this server technology company have returned -7.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, which Super Micro falls in, has gained 5.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Super Micro is expected to post earnings of $5.97 per share, indicating a change of +266.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.15 points to a change of +87.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.95 indicates a change of +30.7% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Super Micro is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.11 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +219.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.76 billion and $19.11 billion estimates indicate +107.3% and +29.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.66 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +103.3%. EPS of $5.59 for the same period compares with $3.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +14.02%. The EPS surprise was +2.01%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Super Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Could Super Micro Computer Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have turned out to be superb investments over the past year thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled demand for their products, which has led to a sharp jump in their revenue and earnings.\n\nWhile shares of Nvidia have gained more than 234% in the past year, Super Micro Computer stock has delivered an even more stunning gain of 855%. Both companies are capitalizing on the booming demand for AI servers although in different ways. Nvidia dominates the market for AI GPUs (graphics processing units) with an estimated share of more than 95%.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, on the other hand, makes modular server solutions that are used for mounting AI chips from the likes of Nvidia and other prominent chipmakers. One might argue that Super Micro and Nvidia aren't exactly comparable, but investors should note that both companies are riding on the same catalyst.\n\nMoreover, Super Micro has turned out to be the go-to supplier of AI server solutions for data center operators and cloud computing providers. But can it become a dominant force in AI servers like Nvidia is dominating the market for AI chips? Let's find out.\n\nImpressive growth, becoming a bigger player\n\nIn the trailing 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2023, Super Micro generated revenue of $9.25 billion. Management pointed out on the January earnings conference call that it gets more than half of its top line from selling server solutions related to AI GPUs. So selling AI server solutions represented at least $4.6 billion in revenue. Based on Foxconn's estimate that the AI server market was worth $30 billion last year, it can be assumed that Super Micro controlled just over 15% of this market.\n\nFoxconn predicts that the AI server market could generate $150 billion in revenue in 2027. That would translate into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49%. It is worth noting that Super Micro's revenue is growing at a much faster pace than the estimated growth of the AI server market. Its fiscal Q2 revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $3.66 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the full fiscal year, Super Micro is estimating revenue of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. The midpoint of that range suggests that the company's revenue will more than double from fiscal 2023's figure of $7.1 billion. So Super Micro seems on track to corner a bigger share of the AI server market.\n\nMeanwhile, Super Micro has been laser-focused on enhancing its production capacity so that it can meet the fast-growing AI server demand. The company points out that its production expansion moves now allow it to support an annual revenue capacity of $25 billion.\n\nThat figure looks set to move higher since the company recently decided to raise additional capital through a common stock offering. Though the move would dilute existing shareholders, Super Micro's plan to use that money to enhance its manufacturing capacity would allow it to corner a bigger share of the AI server market.\n\nBut can it become the next Nvidia?\n\nNot surprisingly, the stock was upgraded by multiple Wall Street firms recently, which believe that its market share gains are here to stay.\u00a0Analysts are expecting Super Micro's earnings to increase at an impressive pace over the next five years, outpacing the growth that Nvidia is predicted to deliver.\n\nConsensus estimates suggest that Super Micro's earnings could increase at a 48% CAGR over the next five years. That's higher than the 38% annual earnings growth that Nvidia is expected to deliver over the same period. Moreover, Super Micro stock has already been delivering much stronger gains when compared to Nvidia. Even then, the stock remains attractively valued.\n\nSuper Micro and Nvidia are not very far from each other when it comes to their earnings multiples, be it trailing or forward. This can be seen in the chart below. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nWhat's more, Super Micro's sales multiple of 5.6 is significantly cheaper than Nvidia's reading of nearly 37. So if the market decides to reward Super Micro Computer with a higher price-to-sales ratio thanks to the eye-popping growth that it has been delivering, it could continue to outperform Nvidia on the market in the future as well.\n\nThat's why investors who have missed Super Micro's surge so far can still consider buying this stock, as its market share gains in AI servers point toward more stock price upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Is Up 3.83% in One Week: What You Should Know",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Super Micro Computer (SMCI), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Super Micro Computer currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for SMCI that show why this server technology company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor SMCI, shares are up 3.83% over the past week while the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry is up 0.86% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 11.55% compares favorably with the industry's 0.62% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Super Micro Computer have risen 245.75%, and are up 847.94% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.42% and 32.12%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to SMCI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. SMCI is currently averaging 8,713,471 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with SMCI.\n\nOver the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SMCI's consensus estimate, increasing from $17.13 to $22.15 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that SMCI is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Super Micro Computer on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Stocks That Have Already Doubled Again in 2024",
        "content": "We may be just three months into 2024, but some investors made a lot of money in the first quarter. Shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR), and Root(NASDAQ: ROOT) have already more than doubled in 2024.\n\nThey are among just 21 stateside-listed stocks with market caps greater than $800 million that have doubled this year, and they are the rare early victors of 2024 that also more than doubled last year. Let's take a closer look at how these three produced wealth-altering returns in just the last three months.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer: Up 255%\n\nThe market's top gainers rarely come through with repeat performances the following year, but Super Micro Computer is hoping to break that mold. The stock has more than tripled in this young year, and that was after more than tripling in 2023.\n\nSuper Micro Computer has been a 12-bagger since the start of last year. It's an amazing run in a mere 15 months, and the shares also nearly doubled in 2022.\n\nSupermicro is a provider of server and storage systems for accelerated computing in enterprise data centers. The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution requires high-octane computing power, and Supermicro is positioned perfectly to ride the wave. Image source: Getty Images\n\nIt's not just an investing craze for AI stocks that's driving the stock higher. Supermicro's growth is living up to the hype. Revenue rose a modest 7% in its fiscal 2021 year, which ended that summer. It saw its sales shoot 46% higher in fiscal 2022 and 37% in fiscal 2023. Its latest quarter is taking growth to an entirely different level.\n\nRevenue for the fiscal second quarter that ended in December soared 103%, fueled by a 107% surge in the server and storage systems that make up 94% of its business. The outlook for the fiscal third quarter is even better, as Supermicro is targeting 188% to 219% year-over-year growth on the top line. The $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion in revenue it's now eyeing for all of fiscal 2024 would more than double its results from last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro has been profitable for more than two decades. The only thing growing faster than its top line is its bottom line right now. However, the stock's blistering success will draw more entrants to the market of companies assembling accelerated computing racks to cash in on the AI boom. There are also the echoes of cyclical risk in any hardware market.\n\nAll this said, it's still hard to ignore, much less fail to respect, what Supermicro has achieved over the past couple of years.\n\n2. MicroStrategy: Up 170%\n\nAnother stock pulling off an encore performance is MicroStrategy. The business intelligence specialist had its stock more than quadruple last year, and it's not slowing down in 2024.\n\nThere's no point in even talking about its actual business here. MicroStrategy is a laggard in its niche. Revenue has declined in eight of the last nine years, including modest negative top-line growth in each of the last two years.\n\nThe real appeal to MicroStrategy is Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC).\u00a0Co-founder and former CEO Michael Saylor has been a crypto evangelist, and the company has spent the last few years building up its position in the leading digital currency. Despite Saylor stepping down as CEO in 2022, he remains the board's executive chairman.\n\nMicroStrategy has increased its stake in Bitcoin for 13 consecutive quarters. It owned 190,000 Bitcoins at the beginning of this year at a total cost $5.93 billion, or $31,224 apiece. Its position has growth to 214,246 coins right now. With Bitcoin trading close to $70,000 on Monday morning, MicroStrategy's stake is worth roughly $15 billion. This is more than half of MicroStrategy's market cap, and it's fair to say that as Bitcoin goes, so will shares of MicroStrategy.\n\n3. Root: 483%\n\nThe smallest of the three stocks by market cap has had the largest gain. Root is nearly a six-bagger in 2024, and that's after barely doubling in 2023.\n\nRoot hit the market as a disruptor for the insurance industry, becoming the country's first licensed auto insurance carrier powered entirely by mobile. The company went public at $27 in late 2020, understandably a challenging time to IPO as a play on the auto market. Car sales and usage stalled early in the pandemic. The previously fast-growing Root would go on to post top-line declines in 2021 and 2022, sending the shares into the single digits.\n\nIt's a different world now. Root's revenue rose 46% in 2023. It's still not profitable, and analysts don't see that changing anytime soon. However, with the platform's growth back to hitting the gas, the stock isn't shifting back into reverse.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks have already made plenty of millionaires.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia alone added nearly $2 trillion in market cap since the start of 2023, and there have been trillions of dollars in market value created among the \"Magnificent Seven\" and beyond.\n\nHowever, according to industry insiders, artificial intelligence is still in its infancy, and some have likened the current phase to the dial-up stage of the internet. Like the internet in the 1990s, generative AI is going to get better, and its applications will proliferate in ways that are hard to foresee.\n\nTo capitalize on that trend, keep reading to see two AI stocks that are worth buying right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nOne of the biggest winners in the AI boom so far has been Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of servers and storage equipment that works especially well for artificial intelligence purposes.\n\nShares of Supermicro, as the company is often known, jumped more than 800% over the past year as the company has emerged as a clear leader in AI hardware. Revenue rose 103% in its fiscal second quarter, and management said that its growth rate would accelerate in the next two quarters as it called for 101% to 107% revenue growth for the full fiscal year.\n\nComments from management indicate that the company could be growing even faster if it wasn't facing supply constraints. CEO Charles Liang said that while GPU supply is improving, \"Indeed, the demand is still stronger than supply. If we had more supply, we would be able to ship more.\"\n\nSupermicro also has a close relationship with Nvidia, whose GPUs have become the technological foundation of the AI boom -- Nvidia has greater than a 90% market share in the data center GPU market. The headquarters of both companies are nearby, and its engineers work together to design server systems that fit the needs of its different customer groups.\n\nThat gives Supermicro a competitive advantage, as does its prowess in offering more customization options than its competitors, and it's also known for bringing products to market faster.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro trades at a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of less than 50 based on this year's estimate, and it has a market cap of $59 billion. If the company remains a leader in AI servers, the stock could turn $250,000 into $1 million over the coming years.\n\n2. Micron\n\nMemory-chip specialist Micron (NASDAQ: MU) emerged as another big potential winner in AI as memory chips play an important role in running the kind of models that make programs like ChatGPT work.\n\nUnlike stocks like Supermicro and Nvidia, investors are only starting to catch on to Micron's growth opportunity in AI, and the stock is still affordably priced at a price-to-sales ratio of 4.\n\nMicron is just emerging from a downturn in the chip industry as a supply glut driven by a slowdown in PC and tablet sales coming out of the pandemic has weighed on prices. However, artificial intelligence is playing a key role in its comeback. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told investors in the recent earnings call, \"We are in the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI as this disruptive technology will transform every aspect of business and society.\" He added, \"Memory and storage technologies are key enablers of AI in both training and inference workloads, and Micron is well positioned to capitalize on these trends in both the data center and the edge.\"\n\nMicron's products also stand out from the competition. For example, its high-memory HBM3E solution provides more than 20 times the memory bandwidth compared to standard server modules and it consumes 30% less power, an important quality in AI hardware, than competing products.\n\nThe company now expects record revenue in fiscal 2025 and a significant improvement in profitability. Based on that momentum and its leadership in memory chips, Micron could also grow by four times over the coming years from its current market cap of $130 billion, turning $250,000 into a million dollars.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

(25:30) - Episode Roundup: NVDA, SMCI, VRT Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss if there is any value left in NVIDIA after its big rally of the last year.\n\nIs NVIDIA expensive now or is it a bargain stock thanks to its big growth trajectory?\n\nThe Case for Buying NVIDIA Right Now\n\nNVIDIA NVDA shares are up 254% in the last year. It has also been one of the hottest stocks in 2024, gaining 91% during that time.\n\nWith NVIDIA trading at new all-time highs, why jump in now?\n\nNVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of 38.8. While that is not in the traditional value stock range, which is normally under 15, that is cheap for NVIDIA, which has often traded above 40x over the last 5 years.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s trajectory changed a year ago, as the demand for AI surged. It has beat, and raised, its earnings guidance each of the last four quarters. In the fiscal fourth quarter 2024, NVIDIA saw record quarterly revenue up 265% year-over-year, to $22.1 billion.\n\nEarnings growth is equally as impressive. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see earnings jump another 84% in fiscal 2025.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Partners Also Expected to See Strong Growth\n\nSkeptical about NVIDIA\u2019s rapid growth? Tracey takes a look at two of its data center partners to see what their sales and earnings trajectory looks like.\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI\n\nSuper Micro Computer is also in the AI trade. It\u2019s hard to believe, but the stock has been even hotter than NVIDIA\u2019s.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer are up 259% year-to-date and 823% over the last year.\n\nBut its sales and earnings consensus estimates are also tracking NVIDIA\u2019s. Super Micro Computer\u2019s sales in fiscal 2024 are expected to jump 103.5% year-over-year to $14.5 billion. The earnings are expected to rise 83.8%.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n\n2. Vertiv Holding Co. VRT\n\nVertiv is another partner company with NVIDIA on the data center side of the AI trade. Shares have jumped 69% year-to-date and over the last year are up 531%.\n\nVertiv is also seeing big growth from AI. It has been beating, and raising earnings guidance, for the last several quarters. Vertiv\u2019s earnings are now expected to jump 32.8% in 2024.\n\nSales are rising, but not as quickly asat NVIDIA or Super Micro Computer. The Zacks sales consensus is looking for growth of 11.2% this year.\n\nVertiv is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n\nIs NVIDIA Too Hot to Handle?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to buy a stock at, or near, a new all-time high. But NVIDIA\u2019s shares have made new highs many times over the last 5 years, as shares have surged 2000%.\n\nFundamentals matter as much as the chart. And NVIDIA has strong fundamentals right now, including sales and earnings growth.\n\nShould NVIDIA be on Your Short List?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s video podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT in her own personal portfolio and in Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Forget Apple: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "For years, Apple has been the top dog. But, as they say, the times are a-changin'.\n\niPhones are old news. Unit sales of the devices have leveled off after years of growth. What's more, the company is now embroiled in an antitrust case with the U.S. Department of Justice that could last years and cost millions -- or billions -- in legal costs and fines.\n\nThe time may finally be here for investors to look elsewhere for outperformance. Let's have a look at two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that could be suitable portfolio replacements for Apple. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nFirst up is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). In the decades-old battle between Microsoft and Apple, Microsoft has taken the upper hand in recent months as its market cap has once again surpassed its rival.\n\nIn part, that's down to Microsoft's competitive advantages in the field of AI. The company has several AI initiatives that are already bearing fruit.\n\nMicrosoft is leaning into the AI chatbot craze with its Copilot assistant. With its ability to generate images, compose emails, code, and shop, Microsoft is hoping Copilot can become many people's \"everyday AI companion.\"\n\nThe company's close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI puts Microsoft on the front lines of AI innovation. One year ago, after ChatGPT took the world by storm, Microsoft integrated some ChatGPT features into its Office software suite -- quickly capitalizing on the buzz.\n\nFinally, thanks to Microsoft's large cloud services business, the company should expect to benefit from the growth of the overall AI market. As AI start-ups look to scale their models, they will turn to Microsoft -- which, as the No. 2 cloud services provider, controls many of the high-performance computers needed to run the latest and greatest AI models.\n\nMicrosoft has several ways to win as the AI revolution rolls on. Accordingly, it may be time for investors to load up on Microsoft and leave Apple behind.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nYes, it's true: Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock is up more than 800% in a year.\n\nHowever, that incredible outperformance shouldn't scare off long-term investors. Here's why: Super Micro Computer's overall business model is straightforward. The company makes the physical hardware that holds and cools the enormously complex -- and expensive -- graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the most complex AI models.\n\nIn other words, Super Micro Computer is rolling like an ice cream shop in the middle of a heatwave.\n\nGranted, that boom won't last forever. However, it could last a lot longer than many think. That's because the overall GPU market is expected to grow 10 times from 2022 through 2032. What's more, those estimates might actually be too conservative. Some industry insiders think the market might grow from $40 billion to $400 billion by 2027, not 2032.\n\nEither way, there is an avalanche of demand for high-powered GPUs, and consequently, for the server racks to house them.\n\nThat's why analysts expect Super Micro Computer's total sales to skyrocket from $7.1 billion to $14.6 billion this year. By 2025, Wall Street expects sales to surpass $20.7 billion.\n\nFor long-term investors looking for a growth stock with serious legs, Super Micro Computer is a name to consider.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 25, 2024\n\nJake Lerch has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten AI stocks that will skyrocket. If you want to skip our overview of the AI industry and all the recent developments, then you can take a look at the 5 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\n\nIf we were to rewind the hands of time to 18 months back, not a lot of people would be hyped up about artificial intelligence. For the general public, the term would belong squarely to the realm of science fiction, and for those in the industry, AI becoming a worldwide phenomenon would appear to be a thing of the distant future.\n\nYet, with the first quarter of 2024 now over, AI is neither exclusively in the realm of science fiction and it is already a global phenomenon. The ball that started to roll with the debut of ChatGPT to the public in late 2022 and early 2024 has now sent chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares soaring by a whopping 518% since the close of 2022. At the same time, dozens of companies claiming to use large language models to help users with their daily lives are now live. They are joined by others that are selling video and image generation software for an industry whose computing needs are thought to sit in billions, if not trillions of dollars.\n\nThese computing needs are also at the center of a fundamental shakeup in the semiconductor industry. Before we get to that though, it's important to understand what AI really is. In layman's terms, AI is a set of mathematical formulae that seek to generate conclusions to queries or problems based on patterns that have been gleaned through training from an existing data set. The more voluminous and relevant this data set is, the better an AI system is, and voluminous data sets require large amounts of semiconductor chips called AI accelerators and GPUs for their processing.\n\nWhile the software end of AI is quite diverse, the hardware end can prove to be a bigger bottleneck simply due to the nature of chip fabrication. Making chips is neither cheap nor easy, and therefore, only a handful of companies in the world are capable of manufacturing high end semiconductors. In fact, only the American Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) are capable of making advanced AI chips. Out of these, only TSMC has been able to rapidly mass produce the latest chips, while Intel is catching up with its technology roadmap and Samsung fails to capture market share to stand its ground with TSMC.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis complexity and cost of manufacturing semiconductors is also why we regularly see unbelievable funding estimates for AI. In fact, the latest such bit comes from the The Information in form of a project that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI are working on. According to the details, the two plan on building a $100 billion U.S. based artificial intelligence supercomputer. The price tag is unsurprising since a single NVIDIA Blackwell GPU - one of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips in the world - costs between $30,000 to $40,000 according to fresh statements by NVIDIA chief Jensen Huang.\n\nSpeaking of Mr. Huang, even before the AI fever, he has advocated new technologies through which 'software will end up writing software' regularly during his technology conferences and earnings call reports. Now, with AI a permanent part of investor vocabulary, Huang's vision also appears to be coming to fruition. This is through the well known venture capitalist Peter Thiel backed startup Cognition Labs considering raising funding for a valuation of a whopping $2 billion. Cognition Labs seeks to develop an AI based tool to write code.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of AI stocks that could skyrocket, another major player in the AI race has been the Menlo Park, California based social media firm Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Before AI, Meta was one of the worst performing mega cap stocks on the market as investors remained unconvinced about its foray into the metaverse. However, it's a Wall Street AI darling now, with the shares up 129% over the past 12 months.\n\nHere's what\u00a0Wedgewood Partners had to say about Meta in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nMeta Platforms was a leading contributor to performance for the quarter \u2013 and the year. Core advertising revenue growth accelerated to +23% while operating margin rebounded strongly from a year ago. The Company has been a consistent beneficiary of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past several years, investing aggressively in deep learning recommendation systems that help power its products, which reach nearly half the population of the planet. Meta Platform\u2019s AI investments, combined with its massive scale, allow the Company to quickly spin up new products across its digital advertising real estate to reinforce its competitive positioning. For example, the Company's relatively new Reels product is just over two years old, yet it has driven a +40% increase in the time Instagram users spend on the app. Reels content and other content served up to Instagram users is often driven by several very large and expensive AI recommendation systems that must sort through billions of datapoints in real time and come up with a probability of a user engagement. The Company is one of the few companies that has been able to consistently and profitably monetize AI technologies for shareholders and we continue to hold it has a top position in our portfolios.\n\nSo, wondering about which AI stocks will skyrocket? We shared our #1 AI stock pick that is trading at a steep discount with our premium subscribers, but there are other investment newsletters that have different stocks in mind. In this article we will take a look at what other investment newsletters think about the best way to bet on the future of AI. 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket\n\nA high-tech robotic drone, showcasing the company's advancements in unmanned aerial systems.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the AI stocks that will skyrocket, we ranked AI stocks covered by multiple investment newsletter websites dating back as far as November 28th, 2023 by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q4 2023.\n\nFor these AI stocks that will skyrocket, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket\n\n10. GSI Technology, Inc.

        "title": "12 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best S&P 500 stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest happenings surrounding one of America's most widely followed stock indexes, then you can take a look at the 5 Best S&P 500 Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe S&P 500 has had a great year so far. The flagship stock index, which was quite jittery a little over a year back, has been doing well as of late. This performance comes after the tail end of 2022 which saw analysts and investors all around worried about a recession in the U.S. due to high interest rates. However, 2023 came with a multitude of surprises in the form of artificial intelligence, falling inflation, and a growing economy - all of which ended up putting the bears to rest.\n\nSo how great has the first quarter of 2024 been for the S&P 500? Well, for starters, the index has set a new record this year. In fact, while the index has been regularly setting records in 2024, its latest record came just before the Easter holiday long weekend. This saw the S&P 500 set a new closing record of 5,245 - ensuring that the index comfortably remains above the coveted benchmark of 5,000 points that most folks would have thought was impossible at the close of 2022 and in an era marked by 'expensive' and difficult to get cash due to high interest rates.\n\nThe next question to ask is, why is the S&P 500 setting new records? After all, despite the ongoing euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence, the close of Q1 2024 has also seen investors re calibrate their expectations for the Federal Reserve potentially reducing the bank rate. These expectations have shifted for the worse, with most folks now expecting the rate cuts to start later than originally expected.\n\nWell, several macroeconomic data points have led to the S&P setting new records. For instance, investors were dealt with a nice surprise in the form of an upward GDP growth revision for Q4 2023 which saw the new estimate grow to sit at 3.4% from an earlier 3.2%. Additionally, even though the commercial real estate sector continues to feel the pinch from a massive shakeup in the bond market and the interest rate environment, home sales in America grew by 1.6% in February to outpace estimates of a 1.5% growth. Another data point that is yet to be reflected in the S&P 500 is the Fed's preferred inflation indication, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest data shows that as of February 2024, inflation in the U.S. stood at 2.5% - meeting forecasts and being more in tune with the Fed's preferred 2% reading.\n\nStory continues\n\nDigging deeper, some of the stocks that have fueled the S&P 500's 11% year to date gains are Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG), and of course, Wall Street's A.I. darling, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The three stocks are up 254%, 60%, and 88% year to date, and the fact that two out of three of the S&P 500's best performing stocks in the first quarter of 2024 are technology companies shows how artificial intelligence has fundamentally shifted stock market valuations. While everyone knows that it's NVIDIA's high end GPUs that have injected steroids into its share price, for Super Micro and Constellation Energy, the catalysts were a second quarter earnings beat and guidance raise for the former and a 2024 forecast beat for the latter.\n\nWhen it comes to investing, while the retail camp is often left reacting to the news, hedge funds spend countless hours and vast sums of money picking out the right set of stocks. As the first quarter of 2024 comes to a close, let's see what the hedge funds were saying about NVIDIA in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAn excerpt from Polen Capital's investor letter for the period is as follows:\n\nNVIDIA shares rocketed higher by well over 200% in 2023 although they slightly underperformed our Portfolio and the Russell 1000 Growth in the fourth quarter. Generative AI has been a huge boon for NVIDIA as the use of LLMs like ChatGPT and others requires tremendous processing power that, today, is mostly provided by NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs. All large cloud service providers, AI factories, and many large consumer internet companies are laying the foundation for generative AI by deploying NVIDIA GPUs and other parallel processing chips to be able to do large scale generative AI either for internal use (i.e., Meta) or as a service for others (i.e., AI factories) or both (cloud service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\n\nGiven many of NVIDIA\u2019s customers or its end customers are still very much in the experimentation phase with generative AI, it is unclear how sustainable the current demand for GPUs truly is. At the same time, it is known that NVIDIA has historically been highly cyclical. By the end of 2024, we believe NVIDIA will already account for roughly half the market for datacenter chips, servers, and networking equipment, which is unprecedented. Even though the valuation at 25x forward earnings doesn\u2019t look very demanding at first glance, it assumes NVIDIA will own virtually the entire datacenter chip market in just the next few years and will sustain year-on-year growth despite being a cyclical business that is currently experiencing much higher new peak.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at which S&P 500 stocks analysts can't stop talking about. A couple of notable picks are Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Biogen Inc.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Super Micro Computer\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nIs Super Micro Computer Still Cheap?\n\nGood news, investors! Super Micro Computer is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $1444.49, but it is currently trading at US$1,010 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Super Micro Computer\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Super Micro Computer generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Super Micro Computer's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since SMCI is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on SMCI for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy SMCI. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Super Micro Computer (of which 2 can't be ignored!) you should know about.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Super Micro Computer, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Spring Cleaning: 3 Stocks to Say Goodbye to Right Now",
        "content": "Spring is here, and flowers are blooming. You know what that means: Time for a good old-fashioned round of spring cleaning.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three stocks that a panel of Motley Fool contributors are ready to say goodbye to this spring. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWill the rise of AI mean the beginning of the end for Apple?\n\nJake Lerch (Apple): Now, don't get me wrong, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has enjoyed a great run. It's the second-largest public company in the world for a reason, and I don't think its stock price is about to collapse.\n\nYet however impressive its past performance, what matters to investors is how the company will perform going forward. And that's where I have concerns for Apple.\n\nTo start with, sales of the company's signature product -- the iPhone -- appear to have leveled off after years of growth. In 2023, Apple sold 231 million iPhones -- virtually identical to the number it sold in 2015. Moreover, iPhone revenue appears to have gone flat. The figure last year was $201 billion. That's down from $205 billion in 2022.\n\nYear iPhone Unit Sales iPhone Revenue 2015 231.2 million $155 billion 2016 211.8 million $136.8 billion 2017 216.7 million $141.2 billion 2018 217.7 million $166.2 billion 2019 187.2 million $142.3 billion 2020 196.9 million $137.3 billion 2021 242 million $191.9 billion 2022 232.2 million $205.4 billion 2023 231.3 million $200.5 billion\n\nBut what about Apple services? Won't the company's growing software division lead to its next phase of growth?\n\nPerhaps. Apple's services segment does now account for almost 20% of the company's total revenue. However, software has never been Apple's bread and butter. Indeed, its long-standing policy of bundling its software and hardware has dampened its growth -- dating all the way back to the 1980s, when the company wouldn't license the Mac operating system to other computer makers.\n\nWhat's more, the real question is whether Apple can compete over the long term with companies that have created iconic software, social media, and web apps -- Microsoft (Windows and Office), Alphabet (Google), MetaPlatforms (Facebook), and Amazon (Amazon.com).\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) raises another question for Apple: What happens to the smartphone business as the use of AI systems keeps expanding? Will anyone want to pay $1,000-plus for a smartphone if everything from TVs to cars to wearables to thermostats is enabled with AI-powered features?\n\nIn short, Apple is at a crossroads. And while I certainly wouldn't bet against the company, I do think investors can find many alternatives with fewer question marks right now -- think Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. And that's why Apple is on my spring cleaning list.\n\nHaving \"AI\" in its name may not be enough to save this stock\n\nWill Healy(C3.ai): At first glance, C3.ai (NYSE: AI) looks like a stock to buy rather than avoid. Given the popularity of generative AI stocks in recent months and the enterprise software company's ability to attract high-profile clients such as the U.S. Army and Baker Hughes, it seems like it should be on a long-term uptrend.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, investors will see serious issues. Though it is successfully attracting enterprise AI clients, the company's strategy appears excessively tied to tech trends. It went by names such as C3 Energy and C3 IoT before it went public in 2020. Those frequent name changes may make investors wonder how committed the company is to its focus on AI.\n\nSecondly, based on its finances, there's some question about whether it can ever become profitable. For the first nine months of its fiscal 2024, C3.ai reported revenue of $224 million, up 15% versus the same period in fiscal 2023. (Its fiscal Q3 ended Jan. 31.)\n\nUnfortunately, its operating expenses (which do not include its $127 million cost of revenue for the period) amounted to $363 million. Consequently, its net loss for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 came to $207 million.\n\nWorse, C3.ai is not showing any signs it can grow its way out of this problem. For fiscal 2024, it forecasts revenue between $306 million and $310 million, which would amount to a 15% increase at the midpoint.\n\nAs a result, the stock has struggled. It had more than doubled in value at one point last year before a dramatic pullback. Over the past 12 months, the stock is up about 10%, significantly lagging the S&P 500.\n\nFurthermore, it trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 11. That multiple arguably makes C3.ai an expensive stock, particularly considering its financial struggles.\n\nUltimately, investors have numerous choices when it comes to investing in AI. Given the state of its finances, investors should probably consider selling C3.ai and putting their money into a faster-growing AI company that's on a path to sustained profitability.\n\nDon't let greed ruin your stellar investment returns\n\nJustin Pope (Super Micro Computer): I've been bullish about SuperMicroComputer(NASDAQ: SMCI) in the past, and I still like the company over the long term. But Super Micro Computer has risen too high, too fast this year. Shares are more than 1,000% above their 52-week low -- a level of return that the broader market would likely take decades to produce.\n\nIf you're sitting on a multibagger today, considering selling some of your stake would be wise. That doesn't mean there isn't much to like about Supermicro. Its modular server systems are in high demand due to the booming investments in artificial intelligence across the technology sector. The company's growth has accelerated to a triple-digit percentage rate, and management believes revenue will grow by over 200% year-over-year in the next quarter.\n\nBut stocks can be volatile, and the broader market has been running hot. The Nasdaq Composite index is up a smoldering 38% over the past year. Eventually, a pullback could pour cold water on share prices, and investors may start locking in some profits from their big winners. Has any stock run as high as Super Micro Computer? It would be hard to find one that has.\n\nI'm not saying you should sell everything and run for the hills. However, greed can be a powerful emotion that works against investors. If you're sitting on huge gains, consider taking some profits. You can always look to reinvest when the market inevitably cools off.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Stock Is Down 19% From 52-Week Highs: Here's Why That's Great News for Investors",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has been pulling back in recent sessions after the company revealed the pricing of its common stock offering, which would dilute existing shareholders. As it turns out, shares of the high-flying server manufacturer are down 19% from their 52-week high, which it hit on March 8.\n\nSavvy investors looking to invest in a top artificial intelligence (AI) stock right now should consider capitalizing on Supermicro's drop by buying it hand over fist. Here's why.\n\nSupermicro investors should focus on the bigger picture\n\nSuper Micro Computer is offering 2 million shares of its common stock for $875 per share. Moreover, underwriter Goldman Sachs has a 30-day option to purchase an additional 300,000 shares as a part of this offering.\n\nThe fact that this announcement came at a time when each Supermicro share was trading at just over $1,000 seems to have dented investor confidence. The company priced the sale at a discount, and the market was quick to press the panic button.\n\nHowever, a look at the bigger picture will tell us that this is a smart move by Super Micro Computer management because the company aims to raise $1.75 billion in gross proceeds through this exercise. Management adds that the proceeds will be deployed for supporting \"its operations, including for purchase of inventory and other working capital needs, manufacturing capacity expansion and increased R&D [research and development] investments.\"\n\nThe company's focus on expanding its manufacturing capacity is the right thing to do considering the booming demand for its server solutions that are used for deploying AI chips. On its fiscal 2024 second-quarter earnings conference call, Supermicro pointed out that the utilization rate of its production facilities in the U.S., Taiwan, and the Netherlands was 65%. Management also added that its remaining production capacity was quickly filling up.\n\nSupermicro, therefore, needed to bring new production facilities online to cater to the fast-growing AI server market. Not surprisingly, CEO Charles Liang pointed out on the call:\n\nStory continues\n\nTo address this immediate capacity challenge, we are adding two new production facilities and warehouses near our Silicon Valley HQ, which will be operating in a few months. The new Malaysia facility will focus on expanding our building blocks with lower costs and increased volume, while other new sites will support our annual revenue capacity above $25 billion.\n\nSupermicro is on track to generate $14.5 billion in revenue this fiscal year at the midpoint of its guidance range. That would be more than double the $7.1 billion in revenue it generated in fiscal 2023. Now that the company has already built up a revenue capacity of $25 billion, it would need to bring more capacity online, given how fast the market for AI servers has been growing.\n\nAccording to Global Market Insights, the AI server market was worth an estimated $38 billion in 2023. By 2032, this market is expected to generate a whopping $177 billion in revenue, for a compound annual growth rate of 18% during the forecast period. Supermicro's share of AI servers has been improving since it has been growing at a much faster pace than this market.\n\nConsidering the lucrative end-market opportunity on offer in the long run, it would make sense for the company to grab a bigger share of this space. This probably explains why management has decided to capitalize on the stock's terrific surge this year and go for a stock offering to raise more capital. Additionally, Supermicro's pullback means investors can now buy it at a relatively cheaper valuation.\n\nAnother reason to buy the stock following the pullback\n\nSupermicro's earnings and sales multiples have retreated of late. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe stock was trading at more than 90 times earnings at one point this month, while its sales multiple stood at almost 7.5. Some might argue that Supermicro is still expensive as far as its earnings multiple is concerned. However, buying the stock right now is a no-brainer. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nSupermicro's forward earnings multiples are significantly lower than the trailing price-to-earnings ratio because of the massive bottom-line growth that the company is predicted to deliver. Analysts expect Supermicro's earnings to increase a solid 86% in fiscal 2024, followed by a 40% jump in fiscal 2025 to $30.83 per share.\n\nNow that Supermicro is looking to boost capacity through its common stock offering, there's a good chance it will be able to boost its manufacturing levels and deliver stronger growth, considering the market in which it operates. That's why savvy investors should consider buying this tech stock as it could regain momentum quickly.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(0:30) - Is Now Still A Good Time To Invest Into Nvidia (5:00) - Learning From Nvidia And Its Partners Performance: Is There Still Room To Grow? (25:30) - Episode Roundup: NVDA, SMCI, VRT Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #395 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss if there is any value left in NVIDIA after its big rally of the last year.\n\nIs NVIDIA expensive now or is it a bargain stock thanks to its big growth trajectory?\n\nThe Case for Buying NVIDIA Right Now\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) shares are up 254% in the last year. It has also been one of the hottest stocks in 2024, gaining 91% during that time.\n\nWith NVIDIA trading at new all-time highs, why jump in now?\n\nNVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of 38.8. While that is not in the traditional value stock range, which is normally under 15, that is cheap for NVIDIA, which has often traded above 40x over the last 5 years.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s trajectory changed a year ago, as the demand for AI surged. It has beat, and raised, its earnings guidance each of the last four quarters. In the fiscal fourth quarter 2024, NVIDIA saw record quarterly revenue up 265% year-over-year, to $22.1 billion.\n\nEarnings growth is equally as impressive. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see earnings jump another 84% in fiscal 2025.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Partners Also Expected to See Strong Growth\n\nSkeptical about NVIDIA\u2019s rapid growth? Tracey takes a look at two of its data center partners to see what their sales and earnings trajectory looks like.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer is also in the AI trade. It\u2019s hard to believe, but the stock has been even hotter than NVIDIA\u2019s.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer are up 259% year-to-date and 823% over the last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut its sales and earnings consensus estimates are also tracking NVIDIA\u2019s. Super Micro Computer\u2019s sales in fiscal 2024 are expected to jump 103.5% year-over-year to $14.5 billion. The earnings are expected to rise 83.8%.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n\n2. Vertiv Holding Co. (VRT)\n\nVertiv is another partner company with NVIDIA on the data center side of the AI trade. Shares have jumped 69% year-to-date and over the last year are up 531%.\n\nVertiv is also seeing big growth from AI. It has been beating, and raising earnings guidance, for the last several quarters. Vertiv\u2019s earnings are now expected to jump 32.8% in 2024.\n\nSales are rising, but not as quickly asat \u00a0NVIDIA or Super Micro Computer. The Zacks sales consensus is looking for growth of 11.2% this year.\n\nVertiv is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n\nIs NVIDIA Too Hot to Handle?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to buy a stock at, or near, a new all-time high. But NVIDIA\u2019s shares have made new highs many times over the last 5 years, as shares have surged 2000%.\n\nFundamentals matter as much as the chart. And NVIDIA has strong fundamentals right now, including sales and earnings growth.\n\nShould NVIDIA be on Your Short List?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s video podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT in her own personal portfolio and in Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Forget SoundHound AI: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Since artificial intelligence's (AI)\u00a0 burst in popularity early last year, investors have been captivated by the potential for AI stocks to go parabolic. Take SoundHound AI for example. Since reports emerged in mid-February that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) owned a stake in the company, its stock has exploded higher, soaring as much as 295% in the weeks that followed.\n\nHowever, investors should be careful, as following the herd can be costly. SoundHound AI has fallen out of favor with at least one formerly bullish analyst and has been the target of a short report that raises several valid concerns. Furthermore, SoundHound AI sells for 18 times next year's sales and, despite its impressive growth, has yet to generate a profit.\n\nThat's not to say this investment won't end up being a winner, but given the risky nature of this company, I would suggest investors forget SoundHound AI stock and look at these two AI leaders instead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWhen it comes to AI, there's a compelling argument that no other company is better positioned to ride the AI wave than Nvidia itself. The company adapted its technology to accelerate AI models years ago and is the undisputed leader in powering machine learning algorithms, with an estimated 95% market share, according to New Street Research.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia already had a wealth of experience when generative AI burst on the scene early last year. The company adapted its processors to provide the computational horsepower needed to run AI systems, and sales were off to the races.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia delivered record revenue that surged 265% year over year to $22.1 billion, fueling adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that soared 486% to $5.16. This marked the third consecutive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year growth -- and it likely won't be the last. For the current quarter, management is forecasting record revenue of $24 billion, up 234% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are other reasons to believe Nvidia's growth spurt will continue. A great deal of AI processing and workloads take place in the cloud, and Nvidia has an edge there as well. The company has a market share estimated at 95% of the graphics processing units (GPUs) used in the data center space, according to CFRA equity analyst Angelo Zino.\n\nThe buildout of data centers capable of AI processing has already begun. CEO Jensen Huang suggests that the spending necessary to bring data centers up to par will double to $2 trillion over the next several years.\n\nNvidia isn't exactly cheap at 38 times forward earnings but has earned the premium thanks to its triple-digit growth.\n\nRather than buy the stock that Nvidia bought, why not just buy Nvidia itself?\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nAnother company that's already reaping the benefits of the accelerating adoption of generative AI is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly referred to as Supermicro. The company also plays a big part in the processing of AI, developing the servers robust enough to handle the AI workload.\n\nThe company partners with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others, to ensure its servers are optimized to work with their latest and most robust processors. Furthermore, these collaborations ensure that Supermicro has a steady supply of AI-centric chips to power its servers.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), Supermicro produced net sales of $3.66 billion, which surged 103% year over year, driving adjusted EPS of $5.59, up 71%. Management was clear that its record revenue was the result of strong demand for rack-scale systems used for AI.\n\nThere are those who believe that Supermicro is taking share from its rivals. Barclays analyst George Wang posits that Supermicro \"has 7% market share globally, implying further share gains ahead are likely.\" He goes on to suggest that Supermicro is stealing share from Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n\nFurthermore, the aforementioned data center upgrade cycle benefits Supermicro as well. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has calculated that the AI server market will grow 75% annually over the next three years, calling the resulting buildout \"unprecedented.\"\n\nSupermicro's stock has surged, up 842% over the past year (as of this writing), yet is still remarkably cheap at less than 3 times next year's sales.\n\nGiven its bargain-basement valuation and history of profits, Supermicro is a far better AI stock than SoundHound AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Is Down 12% From Its All-Time Highs. Time to Buy?",
        "content": "It's hard to proclaim any stock other than Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) as the stock of 2024 (so far). It has been an unbelievable investment and has gained more than 267% so far this year. However, the stock is cooling a bit, as that number used to be as high as 318%.\n\nSo, with Super Micro Computer sitting around 15% off from its all-time high, is now a second opportunity to hop into the stock?\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a leader in server design\n\nSuper Micro Computer is an investor's second chance at buying Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the stock that ruled 2023. While Nvidia sells the GPUs that make up data centers that can be used to create powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models, many companies don't have the expertise to assemble their own data centers to get the most use out of them.\n\nInstead, they turn to companies like Supermicro that specialize in server design. With Supermicro's expertise, customers can highly customize their server to meet any workload size or specialization, be it drug discovery, AI model training, or engineering simulations.\n\nBecause Supermicro is essentially one order down the value chain, it didn't see the benefits from growing AI demand until now. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ending Sept. 30, 2023), its revenue rose 14% year over year to $2.12 billion. But in Q2 (ending Dec. 31), its revenue rocketed 103% higher to $3.67 billion, confirming investors' suspicions that Super Micro Computer was slated for massive revenue growth due to AI demand.\n\nAlongside that massive quarter was a huge bump to its annual revenue forecast. In Q1, management's fiscal 2024 revenue guidance was $10 billion to $11 billion. However, thanks to strong Q2 results and impressive demand, management raised its 2024 guidance, forecasting $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion.\n\nThis massive guidance increase excited many investors and ignited Super Micro Computer's run-up.\n\nBut is it worth buying at its current price, even with the pullback?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock still trades at a hefty premium\n\nWhen a company rises that much, it's safe to assume the stock has gotten a bit expensive. While that's true, there's also another part to the story. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nSupermicro entered the year trading around 13 times forward earnings. The market should have known great quarters were coming due to its industry, so the first 100% return was essentially getting Supermicro to where it should have been trading all along.\n\nHowever, its current price tag of 45 times forward earnings seems a bit steep, especially when Nvidia is currently trading for 38 times forward earnings and has never traded for more than 51 times throughout the massive AI-fueled run-up.\n\nSupermicro also has much more competition than Nvidia, as it faces companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM in the server business. In contrast, Nvidia essentially had the best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI.\n\nAs a result, I can't recommend Supermicro at this price. The company will likely continue to do well throughout this year, as it's slated to post strong growth thanks to server demand. But, the stock has already priced in massive success, making it difficult to grow meaningfully.\n\nIf you bought Super Micro Computer stock based on my Jan. 10 recommendation, congratulations -- you're up around 205%. But I think now is the time to take gains and move on, as there are plenty of other options in the market that will be easier to make money on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

But if you\u2019re serious about making money and investing your dollars in choices that give you the best opportunity to beat the market, you can\u2019t do better than top-rated stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe rating system we\u2019ll use is the Portfolio Grader, which makes identifying top-rated stocks to buy pretty easy. The Portfolio Grader evaluates every stock in the market based on momentum, earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and other factors.

Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the king of top-rated stocks to buy for a year now. And why not? The semiconductor company makes most graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the most advanced artificial intelligence applications in the world.\n\nNVDA stock grew by 239% in 2023 as its valuation jumped to more than $2 trillion, making it the world\u2019s third-most valuable publicly traded company. Revenues also jumped, from $26 billion in fiscal 2023 to $60.9 billion in fiscal 2024. Earnings per share jumped from $1.74 to $11.93.\n\nAnd there\u2019s plenty more to come. Even though other semiconductor companies are making inroads to compete with Nvidia\u2019s chips, NVDA has a huge head start. And it now has tons of cash to help it maintain its advantage through research and development, expansion or acquisitions.\n\nOn top of that, the AI chip market will only grow, with projections coming in at a market value of $119.4 billion by 2027 \u2014 a 123.4% increase from 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA stock will continue to be a winner and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo.

Revenue from commercial clients grew by 32% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, reaching $284 million.\n\nBy contrast, Palantir\u2019s signature military revenue was $324 million but grew only 5%. The number will improve, especially since Palantir won a $178.4 million Army contract. It will build a system to provide the Army with deep-sensing capability enabled by AI and machine learning.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Platform, or AIP, can be used for both defense and commercial clients. That bodes well for future growth.\n\nPLTR stock is up 44% in 2024.

SMCI stock is up 260% so far this year and 824% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe driving force behind Supermicro\u2019s growth is tied to Nvidia and other companies that are working with AI. Super Micro develops storage and server solutions that can be custom-built for its clients. Its products are ideal for pairing the massive number of GPUs needed to run advanced AI and generative AI applications.\n\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $3.66 billion, up from $1.8 billion a year ago. Income of $295.9 million and $5.47 per share was a sharp increase from a year ago, when Supermicro brought in $176.1 million in revenue and $3.31 per share.\n\nSMCI stock is a great way to invest in AI while diversifying away from chipmakers.

The owner of Facebook and Instagram saw its stock drop sharply in 2022 as it invested billions of dollars into CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of the metaverse. That spending coincided with a drop in advertising that rocked META stock.\n\nBut over the last 12 months, Zuckerburg\u2019s company turned its fortunes around. Meta began refocusing on growth and the bottom line, reducing head count and expenses while investing more in the core business. It launched its Threads app as a direct rival to X, the company formerly known as Twitter.\n\nAnd engagement grew as Meta counted 3.98 billion monthly users on its apps in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 6% from a year ago. Revenue also climbed by 25% in the last year, reaching $40.1 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nMeta is also heavily investing in AI, which it will use for public-facing features and to make its advertising more effective.

Nearly half the stocks on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index have jumped at least 10% already this year, pushing the gauge\u2019s price to sales ratio to its highest level in at least two decades.\n\n\u201cThe trick is recognizing who\u2019s really monetizing\u201d artificial intelligence, said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management LLC.\n\nRead more: Micron Sees Biggest Rally Since 2011 After AI Boosts Outlook\n\nThe gains underscore a trend that\u2019s been brewing in the AI space, as investors seek out stocks that can possibly replicate the eyepopping returns of Nvidia \u2014 which remains the only game in town when it comes to the market for processors that power AI workloads.\n\nBut many other components are involved, including memory chips, servers and networking components. Not to mention the equipment used to manufacture the chips themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting more competitive,\u201d said Brian Mulberry, a client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc. \u201cThere\u2019s other ways that you can access the excitement and energy in the sector.\u201d\n\nMicron shares are up by about 30% in the last month, outpacing Nvidia Corp.\u2019s 17% gain. The memory chipmaker has been on a tear since reporting earnings that included a strong sales forecast signaling high demand for AI software.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell jumped to a record high in early March after demand for its information technology equipment used in AI work drove sales and profit above Wall Street expectations.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, a maker of servers, is up 18% this month after it was added to the S&P 500 Index. The company, which reports earnings May 2, will have to live up to expectations that it\u2019s grown revenue more than 200% in the quarter to keep its rally going.\n\nStill, while the rally has broadened, some chipmakers attempting to catch up with Nvidia such as Broadcom Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have been under additional pressure as they continue to lag the industry leader. Broadcom slumped earlier in March after earnings disappointed, while AMD\u2019s revenue forecast in January was downbeat. It has recently been weighed down by a report that China will limit use of its chips.\n\nRead more: Nvidia Traders Find Reasons to Worry Beyond Sky-High Stock Price\n\nAnd with Nvidia still facing sky-high expectations, for some bulls it may be time to identify the next big winner in the AI wave.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s every reason to continue to believe that Nvidia will go higher, but it\u2019s not going to have another 100% return form here,\u201d said Mulberry. \u201cLooking ahead three years, they might actually get a better return on investment.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nShares in video game retailer Gamestop Corp. were poised for the biggest decline in nine months after one of the original meme stocks reported a plunge in revenue. The drop comes after the stock benefited from a run-up on hopes the Federal Reserve would likely cut interest rates this year.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nIt\u2019s taken about 25 years, but Silicon Valley finally feels like the old-school Silicon Valley again. Apple Inc. plans to kick off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10, when the company is expected to unveil its long-anticipated artificial intelligence strategy. Meta Platforms Inc. policy chief Nick Clegg warned US government officials that limiting companies from sharing certain artificial intelligence technologies publicly could harm American influence over the relatively new and evolving global AI industry. Dell cut 13,000 employees over the last fiscal year, a steeper reduction in headcount than initially announced. The crypto sector suffered one of its biggest security incidents this year after a hacker swiped $63 million from a blockchain-based game.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has been one of 2024's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. The server specialist's share price is up 260% year to date, and some Wall Street analysts anticipate that surging demand for AI solutions will continue to push the stock higher.\n\nOn March 25, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee initiated coverage on Super Micro with an overweight (buy) rating. Chatterjee put a one-year price target on the stock of $1,150 per share, or 12% higher than the stock's closing price on Mar. 26.\n\nSuper Micro's position in AI servers could power significant growth\n\nChatterjee sees Super Micro as the top company in the AI server market -- a category that's playing an increasingly important role in pushing the AI revolution forward. The company's high-performance rack servers make use of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and other processors to provide a comprehensive solution for customers who are looking to quickly launch data-processing capabilities for AI.\n\nThanks to the computational demand related to training large language models and other AI applications, Supermicro has seen its sales and earnings grow at an incredible pace. In the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), revenue soared 103% year over year to $3.66 billion. Non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings for the period jumped 72% to $5.59 per share.\n\nUltimately, Chatterjee expects Super Micro to maintain leadership over its corner of the server market with a 10% to 15% share. The company's custom-built server solutions and fast time to market are key competitive advantages. If his prediction proves correct, the company should continue to see demand ramp up as companies launch and scale data centers built for running and distributing artificial intelligence applications.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Charged Higher on Monday Morning",
        "content": "The stock of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, continued its meteoric rise to kick off the week. It jumped as much as 10.3% on Monday morning, and as of 11:59 a.m. ET today, the stock was still up 9.1%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the artificial intelligence (AI) server maker higher was bullish coverage from a pair of Wall Street analysts.\n\nIncreasing bullishness\n\nThe first bit of bullish commentary comes courtesy of JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, who initiated coverage with an overweight (buy) rating and a $1,150 price target. This suggests potential upside of 18% compared to Friday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst noted that Supermicro is \"the leading company in the AI compute market,\" and he expects the robust demand driven by the accelerating adoption of AI to continue.\n\nNot to be outdone, Northland analyst Nehal Chokshi increased his price target to $1,300, for a 34% upside, while maintaining an outperform rating on the shares. The analyst called Supermicro \"the branded server market-share leader\" and believes the company is on track to command a 16% share in the generative AI server market, which his firm estimates is worth $560 billion.\n\nAccelerating demand\n\nSince much of generative AI is processed in data centers, the resulting upgrade cycle is booming and is expected to continue. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi predicts that the AI server market will grow 75% annually over the next three years, saying the buildout is \"unprecedented.\"\n\nFurthermore, Supermicro has continued to gain market share at the expense of its larger rivals, thanks in part to collaborations with the biggest AI chipmakers, giving the company early access to the most in-demand processors.\n\nThe stock has been on fire, rallying more than 1,200% since the start of last year, and is up 276% this year alone as of this writing. Despite its parabolic rise, it is still surprisingly affordable, selling for less than 3 times next year's sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue soared 103%, while earnings per share jumped 71%, despite heavy capital spending to increase its output. Given that growth, I don't expect Supermicro's stock to remain this cheap for long.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Super Micro Computer: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 6 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "It's been three decades since there's been a next-big-thing investment trend that's captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Just as the advent of the internet changed the course of corporate America 30 years ago, there's a growing belief that AI can lead to that next leap in economic growth and innovation.\n\nThe wide-ranging potential for AI to transform virtually every sector and industry isn't lost on Wall Street or its top-tier investors. When examined as a whole, billionaire investors have piled into AI stocks, with many of Wall Street's most-successful billionaire money managers not wanting to miss the boat. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFollowing monumental gains, Super Micro Computer has found itself on the chopping block\n\nOne company that's undeniably benefited from the sky-high expectations Wall Street has set for the AI revolution is server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Shares of Super Micro ended March 19 higher by 220% on a year-to-date basis, and 853% on a trailing-12-month basis, all thanks to artificial intelligence.\n\nWhereas a lot of investors are focused on the gamut of generative AI solutions being offered by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" it's the AI infrastructure companies -- those providing the physical backbone that allow AI-accelerated data centers to do their thing -- which have really thrived. Super Micro Computer provides the customizable rack servers businesses are using in their high-compute data centers.\n\nSuper Micro also has intricate ties to AI darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's high-end servers incorporate Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become nothing short of the standard in data centers geared at generative AI solutions.\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the idea that Super Micro Computer is going to be an outperformer. Based on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the December-ended quarter, three billionaire investors were active sellers of Super Micro stock, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 255,383 shares sold Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors: 144,833 shares sold Israel Englander of Millennium Management: 93,827 shares sold\n\nWhile relying on Nvidia's high-powered GPUs has given Super Micro Computer stock an undeniable associated boost, it also means the company is constrained by Nvidia's supply shortage of its top chips.\n\nFurthermore, Super Micro has a history of failing to meet lofty expectations. The company's customizable servers were expected to be the hottest thing since sliced bread during the initial cloud boom. Unfortunately, demand failed to meet the lofty expectations set by Wall Street and investors. AI may represent another instance of a next-big-thing trend enduring a bubble prior to its maturation.\n\nBut while these three billionaires were dumping shares of Super Micro Computer, they were collectively piling into shares of six other AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSteven Cohen adds time-tested, bubble-resistant AI stocks\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen and his investment team haven't been shy about paring down their stakes in outperforming AI stocks. While positions in Nvidia and Super Micro were significantly reduced during the fourth quarter, Cohen and his aides added to two time-tested AI stocks:\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 462,179 shares purchased Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL): 670,677 shares purchased\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because it operates the world's most-dominant e-commerce marketplace. But the bread-and-butter operating segment that generates the lion's share of Amazon's cash flow and operating income is cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon is giving AWS customers access to a variety of generative AI solutions that can help them tailor their message to customers, as well as improve customer interactions. Given that enterprise cloud spending is still in its somewhat early stages, AWS has the potential to deliver sustained double-digit sales growth throughout the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nSelling Super Micro Computer and purchasing shares of rival Dell Technologies is another interesting move. Dell has a highly profitable personal-computing segment to fall back on if AI-server demand were to taper. Though Super Micro offers the superior short-term growth rate, Dell appears to be a smarter investment for those who want AI server exposure without stomach-churning share price volatility.\n\nKen Griffin piles into the infrastructure backbones of the AI movement\n\nA second billionaire money manager that wasn't shy about kicking Super Micro Computer to curb during the December-ended quarter is Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors. Despite dumping 56% of its stake in Super Micro, Citadel absolutely piled into the infrastructure backbones of the AI revolution:\n\nNvidia: 1,579,153 shares purchased Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD): 3,506,881 shares purchased\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than Nvidia. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia might account for 90% (or more) of the GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. As long as demand continues to outpace the supply of its high-powered chips, Nvidia should have no trouble commanding a high price for its superior product.\n\nAt the same time, I've pointed out no shortage of reasons Nvidia could be the bubble of the century. Aside from history not being in its favor, the biggest concern for Nvidia might be that its top four customers, which account for 40% of its total sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. It's pretty clear that these businesses want to lessen their reliance on Nvidia or replace this AI titan in their data centers altogether.\n\nGriffin's fund also gobbled up shares of Nvidia rival AMD. Last June, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI-GPU as a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100. Though AMD began the rollout of this core AI product to a small group of customers last year, a sizable ramp in production and deliveries is expected this year.\n\nDon't forget that AMD has also been chiseling away central processing unit (CPU) market share from Intel. Though CPUs aren't growing at anywhere close to the same rate as GPUs, AMD's foundational CPU business could help insulate the company far more than Nvidia if the AI bubble were to pop.\n\nIsrael Englander opts for a couple Magnificent Seven components\n\nThe final big seller of Super Micro Computer stock during the fourth quarter was billionaire Israel Englander at Millennium Management. Englander and his team jettisoned 82% of their previous stake in Super Micro in favor of two Magnificent Seven constituents:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased\n\nBuying big into Wall Street's most influential stocks represents a relatively safe way to take advantage of AI growth while protect yourself in the event that AI uptake fails to meet sky-high expectations.\n\nAlphabet's foundation continues to be its internet search engine Google. In February, Google was responsible for nearly 92% of worldwide internet search share. It's practically a monopoly that isn't going to be unseated anytime soon. This gives the company incredible ad-pricing power and generates abundant operating cash flow in most economic climates.\n\nBut Google Cloud might be Alphabet's most-promising growth segment. This now-profitable platform has earned a 10% global share of cloud infrastructure spend. Allowing its customers access to generative AI within Google Cloud can open new revenue streams for Alphabet.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has been actively incorporating AI solutions in its physical products for years. A perfect example being the fine-tuning associated with autocorrect and predictive text for iPhones. Apple is very much reliant on AI advancement to fuel sales of its beloved physical products.\n\nHowever, Apple's biggest long-term growth driver is likely its shift to subscription services. Although it's not abandoning the physical products that endeared users to its brand, Apple is complementing its revenue stream by becoming a platforms company. This move should be positive for its operating margin, as well as encourage users to stay within the umbrella of Apple's product and service ecosystem.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this server technology company have returned -0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.3% change. The Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, to which Super Micro belongs, has gained 27.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nSuper Micro is expected to post earnings of $5.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +246%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.71 points to a change of +83.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.60 indicates a change of +31.7% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Super Micro is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate of $3.9 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +204%. The $14.5 billion and $18.27 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +103.5% and +26%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.66 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +103.3%. EPS of $5.59 for the same period compares with $3.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +14.02%. The EPS surprise was +2.01%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Super Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Super Micro Computer fair value estimate is US$1,137 Super Micro Computer's US$972 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Our fair value estimate is 30% higher than Super Micro Computer's analyst price target of US$876\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nCrunching The Numbers\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  -US$151.1m US$739.7m US$1.50b US$2.16b US$2.85b US$3.50b US$4.09b US$4.59b US$5.02b US$5.39b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x7 Analyst x7 Analyst x4 Est @ 44.36% Est @ 31.74% Est @ 22.91% Est @ 16.72% Est @ 12.39% Est @ 9.36% Est @ 7.24% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7%  -US$140 US$638 US$1.2k US$1.6k US$2.0k US$2.2k US$2.4k US$2.5k US$2.6k US$2.6k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$5.4b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.7%\u2013 2.3%) = US$102b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$102b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$49b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$67b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$972, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Super Micro Computer as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.170. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nCurrent share price is below our estimate of fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "title": "Forget Super Micro Computing. Here's 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Instead.",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) narrative is in full swing. While megacap technology companies have helped ignite the AI revolution, investors have identified several other businesses playing a leading role.\n\nSuper Micro Computing(NASDAQ: SMCI) is an IT architecture company specializing in server rack design and storage clusters. The company works closely with Nvidia, the current poster child for all things AI.\n\nWith Supermicro's services in high demand, investors have been buying the stock in droves. Despite its meteoric ascent and recent inclusion in the S&P 500, I see better opportunities out there.\n\nLet's dig into Supermicro's investment prospects relative to its peers and assess what other options investors have.\n\nSupermicro is on a roll, but...\n\nSurging demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services has served as a bellwether for Supermicro, whose revenue is growing over 100% annually. And the momentum doesn't appear to be slowing down.\n\nBut one thing that I find peculiar about Supermicro's price action is that the stock trades eerily in tandem with Nvidia. While Supermicro and Nvidia have an important relationship with each other, the two businesses are quite different.\n\nMoreover, given that Supermicro's profit margins are actually declining during such robust periods of revenue growth, I've found myself scratching my head as to why the stock is moving higher and higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n...this other AI stock could be a hidden gem, and...\n\nSupermicro competes with other IT architecture designers including IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo Group, and Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL). The common thread that ties all of these competitors together is that they are all diversified businesses and arguably have more to offer than Supermicro.\n\nDell recently reported earnings for the full fiscal 2024, ended Feb. 2. Overall revenue declined 14% year over year to $88 billion. Sales in its infrastructure solutions group (which includes storage, servers, and networking) dropped 12% year over year to $33.9 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven that Dell's IT architecture business is on the decline, and Supermicro is growing like a weed, why do I see Dell as a better investment option?\n\n...the valuation disparity is clear\n\nThe chart below illustrates the price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of a number of companies competing in IT networking solutions. SMCI PS Ratio Chart\n\nAt a P/S of 5.5, Supermicro is the most expensive stock in this peer group based on this metric. The next closest is IBM, which is trading at a P/S of nearly half that of Supermicro.\n\nThe disparity in valuation multiples among Supermicro and its cohorts is tough to ignore. But even with a P/S of 0.9, investors should realize this is much higher than Dell's five-year average.\n\nLike many companies even tangentially related to AI, shares of Dell are clearly witnessing some momentum. While I don't see the stock as cheap per se, I am more optimistic about its long-run prospects compared to Supermicro.\n\nWhat concerns me about Supermicro the most is its heavy reliance on Nvidia. While the chipmaker has a strong pulse on accelerated computing, I suspect competition will be on the rise over the next few years.\n\nAs such, I think it's reasonable that businesses will be outsourcing their data center and chip needs to more than one provider. This could spell decelerating growth for Nvidia, and Supermicro could be affected as a consequence.\n\nSo while I do not necessarily see exponential growth for Dell in the near term, I think the company's role in integrated IT services will begin to rise. As such, Dell could experience a positive jump and return to more respectable levels of sustained growth in the long term.\n\nGiven the discount Dell stock trades at compared to Supermicro, I would at least consider buying the former. A prudent strategy could be to monitor Dell's performance over the next couple of quarters -- keeping in mind that AI is going to be a long-term game.\n\nIf Dell looks to be making inroads against the competition, employing dollar-cost averaging could be a good way to gain exposure to this unique pocket of the AI realm.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dell Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

SMCI Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nSMCI Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nNow, historical performance isn't necessarily an indicator of a stock's future performance. So, there is no guarantee that Supermicro could turn a $20,000 investment into a million once again over the next five years. However, investors looking to construct a diversified million-dollar portfolio would do well to buy shares of Supermicro. Let's look at the reasons why.\n\nSupermicro is gaining share in a fast-growing market\n\nThe proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) has given the server market a big boost. According to market research firm TrendForce, the AI server market recorded 38% growth in 2023, and it is expected to clock annual growth of more than 20% through 2026. Another assessment from Global Market Insights (GMI) estimates that the AI server market generated $38 billion in revenue in 2023, a figure that's expected to jump to $177 billion in 2032.\n\nSupermicro has generated $9.25 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. Management pointed out on the company's January earnings conference call that AI-related server sales account for more than 50% of its total revenue. So, we can assume that the company sold around $4.6 billion worth of AI servers in 2023. That places Supermicro's share of the AI server market at 12%, based on the market's size in 2023 as per Global Market Insights.\n\nThe good part is that Supermicro is growing at a faster pace than the AI server market, suggesting that it is gaining a bigger share of this space. For example, the company's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023) shot up to $3.66 billion from $1.8 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2024, Supermicro's revenue has increased an impressive 58% year over year to $5.78 billion. Even better, the company's outlook for the second half is stronger as it expects fiscal 2024 revenue to land at $14.5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range. That would translate into a year-over-year jump of 104% from fiscal 2023's revenue of $7.1 billion.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting Supermicro's revenue to increase 39% in the next fiscal year to just over $20 billion. However, the company could easily go past that mark, as its new manufacturing facilities have taken its \"annual revenue capacity above $25 billion,\" as management pointed out on the previous earnings conference call.\n\nGiven the lucrative growth opportunity present in the AI server market, Supermicro's focus on capacity expansion should eventually allow it to capture a bigger share of this space in the long run. That should ideally lead to solid growth in the company's top and bottom lines and help Super Micro stock deliver robust gains over the next decade.\n\nHow much upside can investors expect in the long run?\n\nAs noted, Supermicro controls just over 12% of the AI server market. However, it won't be surprising to see its market share rise rapidly in the future considering the company's focus on capacity expansion. If Supermicro does generate $20 billion in revenue in the next fiscal year, its share of the AI server market would stand at 38% (based on GMI's estimate that the AI server market is growing at 18% annually and was worth $38 billion in 2023, the size of the market should be $53 billion in 2025).\n\nAssuming Supermicro can maintain even a 35% share of the server market in 2032, its top line could jump to $62 billion in less than a decade. Supermicro is currently trading at 7 times sales, which is almost in line with the U.S. technology sector's average price-to-sales ratio of 7.2.\n\nIf Supermicro maintains its current sales multiple in 2032 and generates $62 billion in revenue at that time, its market cap could jump to $434 billion. That would be seven times its current market cap, indicating that it can turn $20,000 into more than $140,000. However, it is worth noting that Supermicro is substantially cheaper than other AI stocks. So, it won't be surprising to see the market reward it with a higher sales multiple in the future, and that could lead to even stronger gains.\n\nSo, Supermicro may or may not turn $20,000 into a million dollars once again, but it is clear that investing in this AI stock could help investors achieve their quest of becoming millionaires thanks to its impressive growth and the secular growth opportunity it is sitting on in the form of the AI server market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, SoundHound AI, or Nvidia: Which Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) craze has sent the share prices of many tech companies flying in 2024, but Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) stand out. Their astronomical gains managed to eclipse even AI chip pioneer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has been growing at a fast pace thanks to the buoyant demand for its graphics cards.\n\nWhile shares of Nvidia have gained an impressive 75% so far in 2024, Super Micro Computer has shot 209% higher, and SoundHound AI is up by 268%. But are any of these three AI stocks still worth buying at their current valuations?\n\nAll three companies seem set for solid growth\n\nDespite Supermicro's impressive year-to-date rise, the stock still trades at an attractive 6.6 times sales. That's not surprising, as the company justified its rapid stock price surge with solid revenue growth. For instance, in its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended on Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue more than doubled to $3.66 billion from $1.8 billion in the prior-year period.\n\nAdditionally, Supermicro raised its fiscal-year guidance to a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. At any point in that range, the company would more than double its fiscal 2023 revenue of $7.1 billion. This terrific growth can be attributed to the massive demand for Supermicro's AI server solutions, which are used for mounting chips from Nvidia and others.\n\nAccording to a forecast from Research and Markets, the AI server market will generate $24 billion in revenue in 2024. Based on Supermicro's revenue forecast for its current fiscal year, the company controls about 60% of this market. More importantly, the AI server market is expected to clock annualized growth of 25% through 2029 and generate annual revenue of $72 billion. So Supermicro seems capable of sustaining its outstanding growth pace over the long run, especially considering that it is focused on boosting its manufacturing capacity to meet to the rising demand for AI servers.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are predicting that Supermicro will deliver outstanding growth in the current fiscal year and beyond. SMCI EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nMeanwhile, SoundHound AI benefits from the growing demand for voice-enabled AI solutions. Its revenue jumped 47% in 2023 to $46 million. That was the same growth rate it recorded in 2022, and management forecast that its growth would accelerate in 2024 and 2025. The midpoint of its 2024 revenue guidance stands at $70 million, which would be a 52% increase.\n\nEven better, SoundHound \"expects its growth to accelerate with revenue exceeding $100 million\" in 2025. That won't be surprising considering the company's revenue pipeline. SoundHound says that it has a cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog worth an impressive $661 million, a figure that doubled on a year-over-year basis in the previous quarter.\n\nWhen SoundHound speaks of \"bookings,\" it's referring to \"committed customer contracts,\" while the subscriptions backlog is indicative of the potential revenue it could generate from its existing customers. Its huge backlog shows why SoundHound is slated to deliver solid growth in 2024 and 2025. SOUN Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nFinally, there's Nvidia. It is easy to understand why its shares have rocketed nearly 500% higher since the beginning of 2023 when the AI craze started gripping the stock market. The company is a pick-and-shovel AI play, as its graphics cards have been the foundation upon which AI models are being trained. ChatGPT, for instance, was trained using a huge number of Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units). Subsequently, all the major cloud computing providers started queuing up to buy Nvidia's chips to power the development and rollout of AI applications.\n\nAs a result, it started ramping up the production of its flagship H100 processors, bringing down their waiting period from almost a year to three to four months. Even then, Nvidia management says that the demand for its GPUs will continue to exceed supply. That's not surprising considering Nvidia's monopoly-like position in the AI GPU market, which it is looking to strengthen further with the launch of its new Blackwell processors later this year. Nvidia predicts that these new processors will help it gain a bigger share of the $250 billion AI chip market. What's more, the company's foray into additional AI chip niches such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) could help it unlock new growth opportunities.\n\nAs such, Nvidia seems capable of growing at a healthy pace for a long time. In the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended Jan. 28), its revenue jumped 265% to $22.1 billion. Its non-GAAP earnings surged by 486% to $5.16 per share. Nvidia anticipates its revenue will jump 233% year over year in its fiscal 2025 first quarter to $24 billion. More importantly, it enjoys fat margins in the AI GPU market, which explains why its earnings are forecast to nearly double in the current fiscal year from last year's reading of $12.96 per share. NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSo, the bottom line is that all three AI stocks discussed here seem primed for outstanding growth.\n\nBut which ones should you buy?\n\nAll three companies now trade at expensive valuations. While Nvidia sports a trailing earnings multiple of 73, Supermicro is trading at 83 times earnings. SoundHound isn't profitable yet, but its price-to-sales ratio of 44 is much higher than Supermicro's ratio. Nvidia, for comparison, trades at 36 times sales. Also, Nvidia is growing faster than the other two, and its forward sales multiple is lower than SoundHound's. NVDA PS Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia is cheaper than Supermicro based on the forward earnings multiple metric. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nSo, we can conclude that SoundHound AI has become too expensive to buy right now. Supermicro, while cheap in terms of its sales multiple, is facing margin challenges. Its non-GAAP gross margin fell to 15.5% in the previous quarter from 18.8% in the prior-year period. Nvidia's adjusted gross margin, on the other hand, jumped 14.6 percentage points last quarter to 73.8%.\n\nThis tells us why Nvidia is cheaper when it comes to the forward P/E ratio. So investors looking to buy one of these three AI stocks would do well to buy Nvidia, considering its immense earnings power and dominant position in the AI chip market. Supermicro would also make a nice addition to their portfolios, considering its potential earnings growth, its ability to capitalize on the AI server market, and a cheap sales multiple.\n\nInvestors, however, would do well to stay away from SoundHound for now, as it is too expensive and has yet to become profitable. However, it would be a good idea to keep the stock on your watch list, considering the end-market opportunity it is sitting on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Top AI Stocks to Buy Beyond the \"Magnificent Seven\"",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla, get most of the AI hype. Their stocks have collectively smashed the broader market for the past 18 months.\n\nHowever, many of these names have floated higher to the point that they may not be the best buys on the market today. So, instead, consider broadening your horizons. There are AI stocks beyond the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThere's a good chance you can buy Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Duolingo(NASDAQ: DUOL) today and enjoy great long-term returns.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer have gone parabolic, soaring 850% over the past year. I'll admit, it feels odd saying that shares are still buyable, but I cannot deny the data. First things first: Why is Super Micro Computer up so much? The company has become an important role player in building AI data centers. The company sells turnkey modular server systems. Companies that don't want to waste the time, effort, or money to figure out how to build their systems are going to Super Micro.\n\nThe company's seeing growth take off as a result. Revenue grew 103% year over year in its most recent quarter and 73% quarter over quarter. Management expects revenue growth to accelerate to over 200% year over year next quarter. Triple-digit growth will move stock, and the industry is poised to continue growing. According to Grand View Research, the world's data center footprint could double by 2030 to support AI's growth.\n\nAnalysts believe Super Micro Computer will earn nearly $22 per share this year, pricing shares at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 49. Meanwhile, earnings growth is expected to average 55% annually over the next three to five years. A forward P/E ratio of 49 is reasonable for a business growing earnings at a 55% clip. At a PEG ratio under one, that's an outright bargain if the company lives up to expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Duolingo\n\nDuolingo has been a highflier over the past year. Shares are up an impressive 70%. However, I don't think the company or the stock is getting the recognition it deserves. Duolingo is an educational app that gamifies content to make learning engaging but effective. Its core content is languages, but it's shifting into new content categories like math. Students and users seem to love the app. The company's monthly active user base grew 46% year over year to 88.4 million, and daily users grew 65% to 26.9 million.\n\nThe app is free, so Duolingo makes money by selling premium subscriptions, testing, and data. Duolingo's growth is impressively consistent. Fourth-quarter revenue was up 45% year over year, bringing full-year 2023 revenue to $531 million, a 44% increase over the prior year. That 1% difference in Q4 growth means revenue growth is accelerating. Duolingo's bookings were even more impressive, growing 51% year over year in Q4 compared to 45% for the full year.\n\nManagement states that over 2 billion people worldwide are learning new languages, so the long-term market opportunity is tremendous. The cool thing about a product like Duolingo is that its digital footprint can quickly spread because the only barrier to using Duolingo is not having a smartphone to play it on. Duolingo just turned generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitable, so investors should look for rapid earnings growth moving forward. A good company and product can duplicate a winning formula for many years. Duolingo seems to have found its magic, which means the future could be bright for the company and its investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.89% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 1.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.25%.\n\nShares of the server technology company witnessed a gain of 15.67% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 3.77% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.56%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Super Micro Computer in its upcoming release. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $5.64, indicating a 246.01% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.9 billion, up 204.03% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $21.71 per share and revenue of $14.5 billion. These totals would mark changes of +83.83% and +103.51%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Super Micro Computer should also be noted by investors.

        "title": "10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside. To skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was the worst performer among the major market indices in 2022 and made a stellar comeback in 2023. The index was down 33% at the end of 2022 and recovered from its abysmal performance with a 43% gain in 2023. To put things in perspective, the Nasdaq Composite index hit its previous record in November 2021 with a little over 16,000 points, and it was still a thousand points behind it by the end of 2023, even after the outstanding performance during the year. However, the index has hit new highs and is at 16,275 at March 1 market close. The Nasdaq-100, which includes the 100 largest and most actively traded non-financial companies in the world, recorded its fourth-best performance since 1986, with a 53.81% gain in 2023.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s performance is attributed to the fact that it is mostly concentrated in tech stocks, which were the best performers of the year in 2023. The Magnificent 7 stocks remained in the limelight as several of the top performers of the index were a part of the group, which include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and they gained 239% and 194% in 2023, respectively. However, some other stocks made significant strides through the year as well. Some of them are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), and Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) gained nearly 128%, and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) was 110% higher by the end of 2023. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) performed even more spectacularly in 2023 and is still on a remarkable upward trajectory in the current year. As of March 18, the stock has gained more than 900% over the past 12 months.\n\nAlthough 5 of the magnificent 7 stocks are still performing well and their price charts are still in green on a year-to-date basis, as of March 18, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have declined significantly. Apple is down 4.61%, and Tesla has also fallen out of favor among many analysts and is down 32% year-to-date. However, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest still sees long-term growth for Tesla, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock due to its autonomous driving software. Last year, Wood said in an interview on CNBC that she believes that the company\u2019s stock price will hit the $2000 mark by 2027. In 2024, the investor is still bullish on the stock. Ark Invest bought $141 million worth of Tesla, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock in January, as reported by Bloomberg on January 29. The firm also bought over $35 million worth of company shares on March 14, as reported by Business Insider on the same day.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs There a Stop to the AI Rally?\n\nInvestors and analysts keep mixed reviews about the rising AI trend. While some believe that the AI surge could be a bubble and that tech stocks are now overvalued, others hold the opinion that AI is a revolutionary trend that will dominate the market for years to come. Looking at recent earnings of the tech stocks, the latter scenario is more likely.\n\nThe industry leader, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reported its Q4 earnings on February 21. It reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16, which was up 28% sequentially, and was 486% higher than last year. Furthermore, its revenue increased by 265% year-over-year (YoY) to $22.1 billion. The company's gross margin also increased by 10.6%, year over year, to 76.7% in the quarter. On March 18, Truist and HSBC raised NVIDIA\u2019s price target by $266 and $170, respectively. Truist has a price target of $1,177 for the stock, while HSBC\u2019s Frank Lee raised NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target to $1050. The stock is currently trading at around $885, as of March 18.\n\nAfter NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) first-rate earnings report, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also showed strength in its earnings in the fourth quarter due to a high demand for its artificial intelligence servers. The company reported an EPS of $2.20 and a revenue of $22.32 billion, which outperformed the market estimates by $0.48 and $150 million, respectively. The stock gained 31.5% in a day on March 1 and is up nearly 13% month-to-date as of March 18. Dell Technologies\u2019 (NYSE:DELL) also increased its quarterly dividend by 20%. The company\u2019s earnings revived investor belief in AI, and most of the industry-related stocks moved higher during the day. At Dell Technologies\u2019 (NYSE:DELL) Q4 2024 earnings call, COO and Vice Chairman of the company, Jeffrey Clark, highlighted the demand growth for AI-optimized servers. He said:\n\n\u201cAI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell. We are helping them get started and work through their use cases, data preparation, training, and infrastructure requirements.\u201d\n\nNow let us continue to our list of NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside potential, which includes Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN). You can also check out 11 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now and 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. 10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside\n\nPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 20 stocks listed on NASDAQ with the biggest upside potential through financial media websites including CNBC, Motley Fool, Kiplinger, and Business Insider. Next, we checked each stock\u2019s analyst ratings and price targets on TipRanks. We then chose the 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside at the time of writing on March 18 and listed the stocks in ascending order.\n\nWe also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of Q4, 2023. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside\n\n10. Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 22.99%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) is a Texas-based company that offers energy and industrial solutions. According to TipRanks, the stock has a consensus rating of Strong Buy as per the 14 Wall Street analysts that covered it over the past three months. The average price target of $39.85 implies an upside of 22.99% from the current levels at the time of writing on March 18.\n\nOn February 21, Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) announced that it won a significant and multi-year award for the provision of integrated well construction services for rigs in the Buzios pre-salt field offshore Brazil. The work on the three rigs is expected to begin in the first half of 2025.\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) was part of 47 hedge funds\u2019 portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2023 with a total stake value of $911.825 million. AQR Capital Management is the most prominent shareholder in the company and has a position worth nearly $137.851 million, as of Q4, 2023.\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) is one of the top NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside, along with Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN).\n\nClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPerformance was boosted in the quarter by the Strategy\u2019s more economically-sensitive holdings among steady compounders and evolving opportunities. Oilfield equipment and services provider Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR), meanwhile, benefited from a $20 rise in crude oil prices as well as disciplined execution.\u201d\n\n9. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 44.79%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nInsulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) is engaged in developing, manufacturing, and distributing insulin management systems for diabetic patients. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 50 hedge funds had stakes in Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) with total positions worth $1.197 billion. This is compared to 44 funds with positions worth $938.370 million in the preceding quarter. As of December 31, 2023, Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in the company with a stake worth $288.885 million.\n\nOn February 7, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) announced that its Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system with Abbott Laboratories\u2019 (NYSE:ABT) FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor received CE Mark approval.\n\nIn the past three months, 12 Wall Street analysts have covered Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), and 9 maintain a Buy rating on the stock. At the time of writing on March 18, the average price target of $238.33 has an upside of 44.79% from present levels.\n\nClearBridge Investments mentioned Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cResults were primarily impacted by weakness among two health care holdings, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) and Surgery Partners. Positive clinical studies for GLP-1 therapeutics showed substantial health benefits to diabetic and obese patients, boosting stock prices of pharmaceutical companies tied to the manufacturing of these drugs. The potential for improved patient outcomes raised the risk of lower utilization for Insulet, a maker of insulin patch pumps, and Surgery Partners, whose outpatient surgery centers conduct weight loss and many other types of outpatient procedures. Though the GLP-1 threat is weighing on the valuation multiple of Insulet, any negative effects would likely not meaningfully affect the business for many years, especially given how large and underpenetrated the Type 2 diabetes market is for the company currently. Additionally, this could require significant improvements in cost, availability, and adherence for GLP-1s. Furthermore, we are encouraged that the majority of Insulet\u2019s business today is still from Type 1 diabetes, where fundamentals remain strong and the company is gaining share.\u201d\n\n8. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 50.15%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nFirst Solar, Inc.

As of March 18, the stock\u2019s average price target of $220.72 implies an upside of 50.15% to its current price.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks 933 elite hedge funds, 47 funds had investments in First Solar, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:FSLR) stock in the fourth quarter of 2023 worth $1.106 billion. With 1.79 million shares worth $308.736 million, Robert Pohly\u2019s Samlyn Capital is the top investor in the company, as of Q4 2023.\n\nOn February 27, First Solar, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SHLS) announced its Q4 earnings result with a non-GAAP EPS of $0.12 and a revenue of $130.4 million, which grew by 37.8% YoY.\n\n6. Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 61.26%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is a New York-based media and entertainment company. The stock was held by 56 hedge funds in the fourth quarter of 2023. The total stakes of the funds amounted to $1.122 billion.

Discovery, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:WBD) stock to $16 from $18 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares.\n\nUltragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) are some of the NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside, in addition to Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD).\n\nLongleaf Partners stated the following regarding Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe rules have improved how we analyze existing holdings and influenced the price at which we will buy a new holding and/or trim or add to an existing one. This has resulted in a higher level of resizing positions in the portfolio and exiting some long-term holdings this year. A good example in the portfolio today is Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), a company that we bought too early but that remains a holding in the portfolio. Our average price for the initial WBD investment in 2021 was $26.48, or a P/V ratio in the mid-60s%. However, P/EV on the initial report was 79%. Under the new rules, we would not pay that price for the company today. We most likely would have waited for a mid-60s% P/EV, which would have equated to a $mid-teens entry price. In this case, we would have missed a too-large initial downturn in the stock price. The overweight rule dictated that we trimmed the position after the price ran up in the first half of 2023, which benefitted overall performance as the stock price subsequently fell again. However, even with the new rule lens, we remain confident in our case for the business and management\u2019s ability to deliver going forward.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n17 Worst Bachelor\u2019s Degrees for Student Loan Debt 13 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024 13 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency",
        "content": "Many of the market's top cryptocurrencies surged over the past 12 months. Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) price rose more than 180% as the first spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved and investors looked toward the next \"halving\" which will cut the rewards for Bitcoin mining in half this April. Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) price has also jumped nearly 130% as the Ethereum Network's big Dencun upgrade and hopes for fresh ETF approvals brought back the bulls.\n\nExpectations for stable or lower interest rates also drove more investors back toward cryptocurrencies. That shift might herald the end of the \"crypto winter\" that started in 2022, but cryptocurrencies are still riskier than most tech stocks -- since they're only trading on supply and demand instead of the growth of an underlying business. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo if you're looking for growth but can't stomach the crypto market's wild swings, you can buy some high-growth tech stocks, which might still have more upside potential than the top cryptocurrencies. I believe Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), and ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) check all the right boxes. Let's find out a bit more about these three tech stocks with so much potential.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia became the world's third-most-valuable company in early March. Its market cap hit $2.2 trillion as the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market drove more companies to purchase its data center GPUs to process their AI tasks.\n\nNvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), which greatly reduced its dependence on gaming and professional visualization GPUs for the PC market. The expansion of that business was driven by the soaring popularity of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 126% and 288%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as the AI market grew. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to soar another 81% and 89%, respectively, in fiscal 2025. Based on those bullish expectations, Nvidia's stock doesn't seem expensive at 36 times forward earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSupermicro (as the company is better known) produces high-performance servers for data centers. It controls a smaller slice of the enterprise server market than Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell, but its close relationship with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's top-tier data center GPUs before its larger competitors.\n\nThe partnership enabled Supermicro to carve out a niche in the rapidly growing market for dedicated AI servers. That's why its revenue and adjusted EPS rose 37% and 109%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June). Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise another 104% and 86%, respectively, in fiscal 2024.\n\nThose are astounding growth rates for a stock that trades at 34 times forward earnings. It's also been developing AI servers that use Advanced Micro Devices' new AI-oriented GPUs -- and that shift should reduce its long-term dependence on Nvidia.\n\n3. ASML\n\nASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems for optically etching circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems -- which leading foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing use to manufacture their smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.\n\nLike many other chipmakers, Nvidia outsources its manufacturing to TSMC -- but TSMC can't produce those high-end chips without ASML's machines. That's why ASML is an indispensable linchpin of the global semiconductor industry. That reputation, along with its lack of meaningful competitors, gives it unmatched pricing power.\n\nASML's revenue and EPS rose 30% and 41%, respectively, in 2023. But in 2024, analysts expect its revenue to rise less than 1% as its EPS dips 4%. That slowdown will be caused by tighter export curbs on its shipments to Chinese chipmakers and the excess inventory of chips in the PC and smartphone markets. However, it expects its growth to accelerate again in 2025 as it overcomes those challenges -- so I believe its stock deserves its higher valuation at 43 times forward earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer, Advanced Micro Devices, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Tumbled on Tuesday",
        "content": "After the market close on Monday, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) kicked off its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC), which some have dubbed the \"Woodstock of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\" Thousands of tech glitterati showed up in person to watch CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address, while millions more tuned in online.\n\nDuring the two-hour presentation, Huang expounded on the company's latest creations, collaborations, and partnerships, which will have a ripple effect across much of the tech world. This morning, investors are still digesting the impact of these announcements, which is causing something of a hangover in AI stocks -- likely following the old adage \"buy the rumor, sell the news.\"\n\nWith that as a backdrop, AI-centric server maker Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) tumbled 10.3%, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) slumped 5%, and chip designer Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) declined 2.8% as of 1:26 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\nA check of all the usual suspects -- regulatory filings, financial reports, and changes to analysts' price targets -- was mixed in terms of company-specific news (more on that in a bit), suggesting much of the move was tied to Nvidia's day in the spotlight. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe unveiling of Blackwell\n\nNvidia announced its long-awaited Blackwell architecture, the successor to the company's highly sought-after Hopper processors, which have become the gold standard for AI processing. Huang called the updated B200 graphics processing unit (GPU) the \"world's most powerful chip\" for AI.\n\nThe GB200 superchip combines two B200 processors and a Grace CPU on a single board. Nvidia also developed a new network switch chip -- the NVLink -- that facilitates speedier communication while reducing the burden on the main processors.\n\nThese next-generation processors are being packaged into full systems, including the GB200 NVL72, which contains 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs in a complete rack-scale design. The liquid-cooled system also contains a 72-GPU NVLink, which \"acts as a single massive GPU,\" delivering 30 times faster performance for the large language models (LLMs) that underlie generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Nvidia's chief rival in the AI chip space, AMD's stock price reaction isn't unexpected, as Nvidia raised the bar for AI performance expectations. Analysts from JPMorgan posit that Nvidia \"continues to be one to two steps ahead of its competitors,\" while analysts at Bank of America suggest Nvidia continues to \"widen its competitive moat.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Grace CPU in Nvidia's GB200 was designed by Arm Holdings, which means the company gets a cut of each sale, either in the form of royalties or licensing revenue.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, commonly referred to as Supermicro, partners with Nvidia on its own rack-scale, AI-centric servers to ensure optimal integration and performance from Nvidia's AI workhorse processors. Supermicro announced the expansion of its product portfolio to include these latest powerhouse AI chips.\n\nIt's easy to see how the ripples from Nvidia's announcements will impact each of these companies in both positive and negative ways.\n\nThere was one piece of company-specific news that may have fueled its downturn Tuesday. In a regulatory filing, Supermicro announced a secondary stock offering, with plans to sell 2 million shares of common stock, bringing the total share count to 58.55 million.\n\nCurrent shareholders are no doubt unhappy about the dilution, which amounts to about 3.5% -- far less than today's stock price drubbing. However, since the stock was recently sitting near an all-time high, it maximizes the amount of capital Supermicro will raise. At its current price of roughly $900 (as of this writing), the company could raise roughly $1.8 billion.\n\nAre any of these stocks a buy?\n\nMost market commentators believe that it's still very early days for the adoption of AI. If they're right -- and I believe they are -- each of these stocks has a vast opportunity ahead. For example:\n\nSupermicro has become the server of choice for many businesses looking to adopt AI. Furthermore, the company's building-block strategy allows companies to start small and easily expand their existing systems as the need arises. Arm Holdings controls a vast library of intellectual property (IP) and will continue to see its licensing and royalty revenue grow from the accelerating adoption of AI. AMD offers alternatives to Nvidia's AI processors, as well as CPUs of its own design to accompany them, so it will also benefit from the secular tailwind represented by AI.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Supermicro is the least expensive of the group, with a forward price-to-sales ratio of 2, while AMD and Arm Holdings are selling for 9 times and 33 times forward sales, respectively.\n\nHowever, for those with a long-term outlook and stomach for some increased volatility, each of these stocks represents an intriguing opportunity, especially since it's still early days for AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock lost substantial ground in Monday's trading. The company's share price closed out the daily session down 6.4% according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Notably, the pullback happened even as the S&P 500 index climbed roughly 0.8%.\n\nSupermicro stock was added to the S&P 500 today, replacing Whirlpool in the benchmark index. The move was announced on March 4, and the server specialist's stock posted explosive gains on the news. Even with today's pullback, Supermicro's share price is still up roughly 11% since it was announced that the company was being added to the index.\n\nBeing included in the S&P 500 index is often a bullish sign for a stock. Once a company becomes part of the S&P 500, investors who purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index will also effectively be buying shares of that company's stock. In turn, that tends to increase demand and send its share price higher. Being part of the S&P 500 is also a prestigious distinction, and it can bolster the appeal of a still relatively little-known company, such as Supermicro.\n\nBut in this case, it looks like some investors got overly excited about the short-term pricing impact that actually being added to the index would have. While the stock had actually been up as much as 7.4% early in the day's trading, many shareholders moved to take profits shortly after the market opened.\n\nIs Supermicro stock still a smart buy?\n\nEven with today's sell-off, Supermicro has been one of this year's best performing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. The company's share price has rocketed roughly 252% higher across 2024's trading thanks to AI-driven demand for its high-performance rack servers. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nSupermicro stock is now trading at roughly 46 times this year's expected earnings and a bit under 33.5 times next year's expected profits. Meanwhile, the company has a forward price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of roughly 0.5 and a one-year forward PEG of roughly 0.6. Typically, a PEG of less than one is viewed as an indication that a stock is undervalued.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on the company's recent sales and earnings growth and the emergence of AI-related tailwinds, it's not unreasonable to think that Supermicro stock can still deliver big wins over the long term. But investors should approach the stock with the understanding that near-term performance could be bumpy on the heels of such explosive growth. With that in mind, taking a dollar-cost-averaging approach to the stock looks like a sensible strategy for bulls right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) were all over the stock charts today as the artificial intelligence (AI) stock was officially added to the S&P 500 index.\n\nSupermicro, as the the maker of AI servers and storage equipment is known, initially jumped on the news, gaining as much as 7.4% at the open, but slid over the course of the morning, and was down 10% by 1:05 p.m. ET. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy Supermicro couldn't hold onto its gains\n\nSupermicro has been one of the biggest winners in the AI boom over the last year, but it's also been one of the most volatile as its recent gains seem to be driven as much by improving fundamentals as they are by momentum, with the stock up more than 200% year to date.\n\nToday's sell-off seemed to be a buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news type of event as investors took the opportunity to take profits after Super Micro Computer was added to the S&P 500. Shares of the AI hardware specialist jumped 19% two weeks ago when S&P Global said it would be added to the benchmark index.\n\nWhile trading volume in the stock was trending above its three-month average today, it was still lower than many of the stock's busiest days in recent weeks.\n\nToday's decline was also in contrast to most of the AI sector, which gained in anticipation of Nvidia's annual GTC conference, which begins today.\n\nWhere is Supermicro stock headed?\n\nAdmission to the S&P 500 is a positive for Super Micro Computer as it forces exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index to buy the stock and acts as a stamp of approval from S&P Global.\n\nOver the long term, Supermicro stock looks well positioned to be a winner if the AI boom continues given its strength in essential hardware, but investors should expect the volatility in the stock to continue in the near term as it swings on news and momentum in the AI sector and due to activity from short-term traders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), a fund largely composed of tech stocks, has soared 45% over the past year. And in some specific semiconductor and AI-related names, the gains have been parabolic. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has rocketed more than 1,000% over the past 12 months, to give one example.\n\nWhile the gains have been extraordinary, there\u2019s no guarantee that the good times will keep on rolling. For one thing, the Federal Reserve may back away from its plans to cut interest rates given a recent string of hot inflation readings. And for another, while AI is a technology with extraordinary promise, it is far less certain how the proliferation of AI tools will impact corporate earnings.\n\nParticularly within the tech stock space, there are some companies that have seen shares run-up with the AI wave but which may not actually see their businesses improve in the months and years to come. With valuations at lofty levels, it\u2019s time to sell these tech stocks before the inevitable correction arrives.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) finds itself in an interesting place, as it pertains to artificial intelligence. The graphics software company could find itself benefitting if AI enables faster workflows and broadens the addressable marketplace for its services.\n\nOn the other hand, artificial intelligence could cause many of Autodesk\u2019s current customers to abandon Autodesk\u2019s solutions entirely and outsource everything to AI.\n\nThis risk came to a head last week when another graphics software firm, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) saw shares fall 14% following a soft earnings report. Adobe already dipped in February following the debut of OpenAI\u2019s Sora text-to-video generator. And Adobe\u2019s underwhelming earnings report added to the concerns that AI could be a Trojan horse for the graphics software space.\n\nTurning to Autodesk, its shares have rallied 30% over the past year, in part due to hopes that AI will add to its bottom line. But, like Adobe, it faces the risk that nimble competitors will be able to use bespoke AI tools to whittle away at chunks of Autodesk\u2019s core design and digital prototyping market. With Autodesk selling at 32 times estimated fiscal year 2025 earnings, there is little room for error here if anything goes wrong for Autodesk on a business execution standpoint.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarvell Technologies (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technologies (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor company which is involved in a number of different chip businesses. It focuses on System-on-a-Chip architectures along with Ethernet solutions, electro-optical products and custom application specific integrated circuits among others.\n\nWhile Marvell is broadly diversified across chip types, its AI product offerings have garnered most of the attention in recent months. Marvell makes a point of highlighting its partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its focus on delivering AI infrastructure for the AI Era.\n\nShares of MRVL stock soared over the past year thanks to the hopes that Marvell\u2019s AI positioning would lead to robust profit growth. Alas, it wasn\u2019t to be.\n\nMarvell\u2019s recent Q4 results were a huge disappointment. The company grew revenues just 1% year-over-year. Making matters worse, Marvell reported a net loss for the quarter. And the weakness is expected to continue into fiscal year 2025; the company offered Q1 guidance far below Wall Street estimates and noted that its gross margin may fall sequentially. For all the hype around AI growth, for companies such as Marvell, it hasn\u2019t translated into meaningful results on the bottom line.\n\nAirship AI Holdings (AISP) Stock Photo ID: 1659535744 Industrial technology concept. Container terminal. Logistics. Communication network. Secured logistics. GFAI stock.\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirship AI Holdings (NASDAQ:AISP) offers a software platform for video, sensor, and data management surveillance focused on law enforcement and crime prevention solutions. With the focus on artificial intelligence, traders have taken an interest in AISP stock; shares have leapt fivefold in the month of March.\n\nTo put more context on that, Airship AI came public via a SPAC with BYTE Acquistion. Shares dropped from the initial $10 offering price down to less than $2, as the business didn\u2019t appear to be showing much initial momentum.\n\nEven based on the firm\u2019s SPAC investor presentation, it looked like revenues were only growing around 10-15% per year and the company was projected to generate just $14.5 million in revenues in 2022.\n\nShares are rocketing lately on a series of new project announcements. However, without much tangible in the way of revenues or profits, it\u2019s hard to forecast how much these contracts really add to the bottom line.\n\nIn any case, Airship AI has been in business since 2006 and is still generating quite limited revenues after 18 years. I\u2019m highly skeptical that the current AI wave will suddenly turn this struggling software firm\u2019s fortunes around. With the stock up fivefold virtually overnight, traders should head to the exits.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Super Micro Computer, which joins the S&P 500 on Monday, enjoys a rare advantage among server makers that are trying to tap the generative AI boom - close ties with Nvidia that help it launch products faster than rivals Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n\nThe company has historically been among the first to receive artificial intelligence chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices as it helps them check server prototypes, giving it a head start over rivals, analysts and industry experts said.\n\nThat has helped turn the company into a key supplier of servers essential for generative AI apps and sent Super Micro's shares up 289% so far this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome analysts estimate Super Micro, whose California headquarters are less than 10 miles away from those of Nvidia and AMD, can within just \"a few weeks\" manufacture, assemble, test and ship a server rack, if components are available.\n\n\"Super Micro has developed a model that is very, very quick to market. They usually have the widest portfolio of products when a new product comes out from Nvidia or AMD or Intel,\" said Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities.\n\nSuper Micro's revenue more than doubled in the last three months of 2023 and analysts polled by LSEG expect triple-digit percentage growth to continue till at least the September quarter of 2024.\n\nBank of America analysts estimate the company's share of the AI server market to grow to about 17% in 2026, from 10% in 2023.\n\nThat optimism is reflected in Super Micro's growing market value, which now stands at $60 billion, compared with some $5 billion before the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nThe AI demand has also lifted shares of Dell by 40% this year, including a gain about 32% earlier this month after an upbeat annual forecast. HP Enterprise shares are down about 1% in 2024.\n\nBoth Dell and HP Enterprise did not respond to requests for their go-to-market times for AI servers.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the massive rally also means that Super Micro is now trading at 40 times expected earnings, far higher than its PE of 15 last December, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe expensive PE valuation increases the risk of selloff if Super Micro fails to meet future earnings expectations.\n\nLIQUID COOLING\n\nSuper Micro is also riding on a rush of demand for liquid cooling tech from data center operators deploying much hotter and power-hungry AI chips, analysts and industry experts said.\n\nThey added that the heat produced by chips used in AI servers has more than doubled and is set to double again in the next 2 to 3 years.\n\nSuper Micro's tech, developed in-house, involves putting cold liquid over a plate placed on top of a chip and cuts power consumption by about 40% compared with air cooling.\n\nBy 2030, liquid cooling is projected to become the dominant method for cooling servers, said Ben Smith, product head at immersion cooling technology provider Green Revolution Cooling.\n\nHP Enterprise and Dell, however, expect the adoption of liquid cooling to be much lower.\n\nAnalysts also cautioned it could be tough for Super Micro to maintain its advantage in AI servers as larger rivals shift focus to the market, adding that the company has been offering its products at cheaper rates to gain market share.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)",

        "title": "3 Green Flags for Super Micro Computer's Future",
        "content": "Shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have skyrocketed over the past few years, up nearly 3,000% in three years, which means investors have made a stunning 30 times their money in that short amount of time.\n\nYet analysts continue to pour compliments on the company and raise their target prices even today, with the highest Wall Street target on the stock at $1,350 -- 26% higher than the current stock price.\n\nWhat continues to go right for Super Micro? A lot of things, which should enable strong growth over the next few years and keep the stock price up and to the right.\n\nThe outlook for AI servers is staggering\n\nEven though it's been 16 months since the debut of ChatGPT, we're still in the very early innings of the AI revolution. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said AI and accelerated computing will drive a doubling of the installed base of data centers in short order, from $1 trillion to $2 trillion. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su believes the AI chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027, with the majority of those chips going into AI servers.\n\nCorroborating Su's projection is Hon Hai Precision(OTC: HNHPF), better known as Foxconn. Foxconn's management believes the AI server industry, including hardware, software, and services, will grow at a stunning 42% annual growth rate between 2022 and 2032, rising from $40 billion in 2022 to $400 billion by 2027 and an eye-watering $1.3 trillion by 2032.\n\nIf these astonishing growth rates make you skeptical, consider these recent data points. According to an IDC study commissioned by Microsoft in November of last year, for every $1 a company spends on AI, it achieves an average $3.50 return on that investment, with the top 5% efficient companies achieving an $8 return for every dollar invested.\n\nAnd that's just today. Keep in mind, with every generation of chips, AI systems are going to get better and better with every passing year. On a recent podcast, noted futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that AI systems will surpass human intelligence by 2029, and also admitted that prediction may in fact be \"conservative.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the hypercompetitive nature of business today, it's no surprise that corporations are spending on AI hand over fist, and probably will for years to come. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSuper Micro is getting an outsize bite of the AI pie\n\nWhile a skyrocketing industry is good for Super Micro, Super Micro also is getting an extra bite of the apple by taking market share across the server industry amid the AI transition. One can point to a number of reasons for this, including Super Micro's \"Lego-like\" building-block server architecture, close ties to Silicon Valley chipmakers, and focus on energy efficiency and power-saving technologies such as liquid cooling.\n\nBut whichever way one slices it, Super Micro appears to be winning in AI servers. For the past few quarters, Super Micro has noted that it now gets over half of its revenue from AI/GPU server systems, leading to a stunning 73% quarter-over-quarter and 103% year-over-year growth rate last quarter.\n\nWhile competitor comparisons are somewhat imperfect, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) and HP Enterprise(NYSE: HPE), its main rivals, have each reported a lower percentage of their server revenue coming from AI systems. Dell's AI-optimized server revenue of $800 million equated to just 8.5% of its total infrastructure segment's revenues, or about 16.5% of its non-storage server revenue last quarter. Meanwhile, HPE noted that about 25% of its server orders since the beginning of last year were for accelerated computing/GPU systems. Those relatively low percentages meant Dell and HPE saw relatively lackluster overall growth, with their total server revenue actually falling last quarter, as the traditional server business is still in a downturn.\n\nSuper Micro's biggest competition may not come from these large branded OEMs at all, but rather the \"white label\" ODMs like Foxconn that sell parts directly to large cloud companies who make their own servers and even sell parts to other branded OEMs like Dell and HP. In its recent earnings call, Foxconn noted that only about 30% of its 2023 server revenue came from AI servers -- higher than Dell/HP but significantly lower than Super Micro. While some parts such as GPU modules are seeing 100% growth, Foxconn still projects only about 40% overall AI server growth growth this year, with AI servers growing to about 40% of its overall server revenue in 2024.\n\nSuper Micro garnered only about 5.3% share of the branded OEM server market last year, compared with 19.3% for Dell and 13% for HP, according to History-Computer. But its market share was even smaller when compared to the entire server market including ODMs, whose direct sales account for about 25% of the server market. Factoring that in, and Super Micro's current market share falls under 4%.\n\nWhen a small market-share company begins to take significant market share from larger players, it could signal a disruptive event. And industry disruption usually leads to eye-opening growth and stock market returns.\n\nWelcome to the big leagues\n\nValidation of Super Micro's recent ascent came from its recent acceptance into the S&P 500 index, which was announced earlier this month but is actually officially happening today. At a $60 billion market cap, both Super Micro and trendy footwear company Deckers Outdoor will be replacing Whirlpool and Zion's Bancorp in the vaunted index today.\n\nAside from the prestige that comes with officially cracking the top 500 U.S. companies, Super Micro may also benefit from the \"forced buying\" of shares from index funds which are designed to track this index. Unsurprisingly, the funds that track the most \"generic\" index is the most popular type of index fund in the world, so there should be significant buying of the stock beginning this week.\n\nWith the diversified mix of the largest, most liquid, and \"safest\" stocks, it's no wonder that S&P 500 index funds are a favorite of Warren Buffett, who recommends putting all of one's money into an S&P 500 index fund if one doesn't have the time to research individual stocks.\n\nIt's been an amazing journey to get to this point. In fact, five years ago, Super Micro wasn't even listed on a major exchange. Its stock had been kicked off the Nasdaq and was trading over-the-counter, after problems in the company's accounting controls weren't remedied in time for regulators back in 2018.\n\nBut with Super Micro's fixing its internal controls, its readmission to the Nasdaq in January 2020, and its harnessing the AI revolution, look how far it's come. With S&P 500 admittance, the stock seems set to become even more of a household name.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "We've already gotten a taste of artificial intelligence's (AI) potential thanks to various products and services -- from chatbot ChatGPT to AI-powered medical devices. But there's a lot more to discover and develop. And this is why now is the perfect time to get in on AI stocks: We've seen this technology's potential, but this growth story is just beginning. And that means AI stocks offer us the possibility of tremendous gains down the road.\n\nAnd AI stocks can be found in many industries, considering a broad range of companies are investing in this technology. That means an investment in AI stocks also could offer you a certain degree of diversification -- another plus for your portfolio. But where to start? Here are my top AI stocks to buy right now in March. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) plays a key behind-the-scenes role in AI, and this role has helped the company's earnings to take off in recent times. It just reported its first $3 billion quarter, which surpasses its revenue for the entire year back in 2021.\n\nSupermicro sells servers, workstations, full rack scale solutions, and more -- and these tools are essential for AI customers. The company's growth rate over the past year was five times faster than that of its industry, showing Supermicro stands out.\n\nThe company's building blocks architecture -- using common elements across products -- along with its close working relationships with top chipmakers help it bring products to market fast. For example, Supermicro knows when Nvidia will release the latest chip so that chip will immediately be available in Supermicro products.\n\nSupermicro recently was invited to join the S&P 500, proof this company is one to watch -- and add to your portfolio.\n\n2. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) helps its customers aggregate often disparate pieces of their data and use that data to improve operations. For years, the company's biggest customers have been governments. But with the AI boom, commercial customers now are turning more and more to Palantir -- and flocking to its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).\n\nStory continues\n\nAIP, using AI of course, allows customers to harness the power of their data, and the company has come up with a genius manner of bringing these customers on board. It holds AI Bootcamps meant to help the customer create a use case in just a few hours. The effort is working, and Palantir's earnings have taken off in recent times -- with commercial customer growth surging.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, U.S. commercial revenue soared 70%, and commercial customer count increased 55%. Palantir recently announced more than 20 new customers and partners at its recent AIPCon event.\n\nThe commercial customer is on track to become a big growth driver for Palantir, meaning now is a great time to get in on this AI growth stock and benefit as the story unfolds.\n\n3. Medtronic\n\nMedtronic(NYSE: MDT) is a medical device giant, so you may not immediately think of it as an AI company. But this player actually is among leaders in the AI in healthcare space. And in healthcare, AI could eventually become transformative for patients, healthcare providers, and companies. The companies that develop the best AI tools, ones that may greatly improve patient outcomes, could see earnings take off as customers flock to these devices.\n\nAnd Medtronic already is on the way. The company has received regulatory approval so far for five AI products, including the GI Genius for gastroenterology and an AI-based platform for spinal surgery planning. In the most recent quarter, Medtronic said it saw \"strong adoption\" of the spine surgery platform.\n\nThese programs could help Medtronic stand out from its rivals and dominate in areas where competition is high. The company recently said the spine industry has been disrupted by consolidation, but growth of Medtronic's spine platforms is keeping the company strong in this area.\n\nMedronic already has delivered earnings growth over time, as well as dividend payments -- and this is set to continue. The icing on the cake? Medtronic's focus on AI could offer it a new growth driver that may pay off for investors over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: SoundHound AI vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) represent two very different ways to invest in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market. SoundHound's namesake app is used to identify and discover songs, while its Houndify developer platform enables companies to create their own speech-recognition tools. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, is a leading producer of AI servers.\n\nBoth companies have close ties to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia was one of SoundHound's earliest backers prior to its public debut in 2022, and it recently made another investment in the company. Supermicro's partnership with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's top-tier data center graphics processing units (GPUs) before most of its competitors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThat's why both stocks soared alongside Nvidia's as the AI market expanded. Over the past 12 months, SoundHound's stock jumped 248% as Supermicro's stock rallied 1,150%. But should you invest in either of these high-flying AI stocks right now?\n\nSoundHound is a speculative stock\n\nSoundHound competes against Microsoft and Alphabet's Google in the audio and speech-recognition market, but its Houndify platform is an appealing option for companies that don't want to tether themselves to those tech giants.\n\nAutomakers like Hyundai and Stellantis, smart TV makers like Vizio, and fast-food chains like Church's Chicken all use Houndify to create custom voice-recognition services. That market should continue expanding as generative AI technologies become more sophisticated. It also recently acquired the restaurant-solutions provider SYNQ3 to expand its ecosystem.\n\nSoundHound went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2022. Its revenue rose 47% in both 2022 and 2023, and analysts expect its revenue to rise 51% to $69.5 million in 2024.\n\nBut based on those expectations and its enterprise value of $2.2 billion, SoundHound's stock still looks pricey at 32 times this year's sales. It's also unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, and it doesn't even expect its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to turn positive until 2025. Its high debt-to-equity ratio of 4.3 could also limit its ability to raise fresh cash.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose issues could limit its upside potential as long as interest rates stay elevated, but it could still carve out a defensible niche in the evolving voice-recognition market and attract some buyout interest from its bigger competitors.\n\nSupermicro is a foundational player in the AI market\n\nSupermicro isn't the world's largest producer of pre-built servers, but it differentiated itself from its larger competitors by building high-performance servers for tougher tasks. That focus made it an ideal partner for Nvidia, which worked with Supermicro to design AI servers which used its high-end data center GPUs. Nvidia's rival AMD has also been working with Supermicro to develop new AI servers for that booming market.\n\nWhen Supermicro went public back in 2007, it didn't initially gain much attention because the server market was already heavily commoditized. But over the past few years, it became one of the market's hottest growth stocks as the generative AI market exploded and data center operators ramped up their orders of AI servers.\n\nSupermicro's revenue soared 46% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022) and grew another 37% in fiscal 2023. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 104% in fiscal 2024 as the market's demand for new AI servers consistently outstrips its available supply. For fiscal 2025, they expect revenue to rise another 36% to $19.8 billion.\n\nSupermicro ended its latest quarter with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.8. It's profitable, and analysts expect its earnings per share (EPS) to soar 86% in 2024 and 35% in 2025. Its stock still looks reasonably valued relative to those expectations at 37 times forward earnings and 3 times next year's sales. But the AI market needs to keep expanding -- and Supermicro needs to consistently grow its share of the AI server market -- for the company to reach those targets and support its rising valuations.\n\nThe better buy: Super Micro Computer\n\nBoth of these AI companies are growing rapidly, but Supermicro is clearly a better buy than SoundHound AI. Supermicro has a more established business; it has a wider moat; it's more profitable; and its stock looks cheaper. SoundHound might have gained some fresh attention with Nvidia's investment, but it hasn't proven that its business model is sustainable yet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Company Has Returned Nearly 5,830% in Just Five Years and Is Headed for the S&amp;P 500. Is It Too Late to Buy?",
        "content": "Perhaps the biggest business powering the markets right now is artificial intelligence (AI). It seems that every software developer is eager to cash in on AI euphoria, and technology stocks are reaping the benefits.\n\nAs the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite trade at record levels, my eyes have been on one stock in particular. The best part? It's not in the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nShares of Super Micro Computing(NASDAQ: SMCI) have soared 5,830% in just five years. So far in 2024, they have risen over 300% as of market close on March 8. A lot of the momentum pushing the stock right now revolves around the company's latest milestone: inclusion in the S&P 500.\n\nThis company is playing an important role in the AI realm. Let's dig into Super Micro's business and get an understanding of why the stock is going parabolic.\n\nA superb run\u00a0to the top, but...\n\nSuper Micro plays a crucial role at the intersection of semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI). The company designs integrated systems for IT architecture, which could include storage clusters or server racks.\n\nGiven rising interest in graphics processing units (GPUs) from the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices over the last year, Supermicro's services have been in high demand in the background. SMCI revenue (quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nRevenue is growing over 100% annually, and AI tailwinds make for an encouraging long-term outlook. It's no wonder one Wall Street analyst has referred to Supermicro as a \"stealth Nvidia.\"\n\nAs with all businesses, there is more to the picture than sales acceleration -- as great as it is at the moment. Let's look at some other factors to hone the full investment thesis here.\n\n...there are some lingering concerns\n\nOne of the most important things for investors to understand is that Supermicro is very much a hardware operation, and its margin profile is much lower than you might think.\n\nFor the quarter ended Dec. 31, gross margin was 15.4%. This represented a decrease from the prior quarter and the same period in the previous year. Management addressed the margin deterioration during the earnings call, explaining that aggressive investments in new designs and market share acquisition were the culprits.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpending to grow is an argument that only goes so far. In the long run, Supermicro will have to prove that margin expansion and consistent cash flow are achievable. Image Source: Getty Images.\n\nValuation is becoming disconnected from fundamentals\n\nGiven the role of semiconductors in the AI revolution, it makes some sense that stocks such as Nvidia and AMD are garnering attention. However, Supermicro's close affiliation with these chipmakers has brought some momentum into the picture. This dynamic can carry a lot of risk, as investors might think they are buying into the next Nvidia.\n\nBut as noted above, Supermicro and Nvidia are very different businesses. At best, they are tangentially related. More appropriate comparisons include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Dell, and IBM. Its stock current trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 7, more than double that of IBM.\n\nNot only is Super Micro by far the most expensive stock among this cohort, but the other companies mentioned above have more prolific businesses all around. It is an extremely specialized operation and is not as diverse as IBM or Dell, for instance.\n\nI see it as an interesting way to invest in AI. The company operates in an important pocket in the AI landscape, albeit one that is under the radar.\n\nBut with low margins and an expanding valuation, the stock's premium appears to be increasingly less connected from fundamentals. While inclusion in the S&P 500 is a respectable milestone, it's not reason enough to chase the stock even though it may soar in the near term as ETFs and passive funds that mimic the index rebalance their portfolios to include the new stock in the index.\n\nFor now, I would sit on the sidelines and monitor the company's performance. If Super Micro Computer is going to be an influential component of the AI narrative in the long run, investors will have ample opportunities to buy at more appropriate valuations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Dropped Great News for Super Micro Computer Stock",
        "content": "Share prices of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) took off in the past year, gaining 1,180% as of this writing, and a big reason behind the stock's red-hot surge is the booming demand for Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI) graphics cards.\n\nSupermicro's modular server rack-scale systems are being used to mount AI-related graphics cards from Nvidia, as well as other chipmakers. As the demand for Nvidia's cards has increased, Supermicro has also witnessed a terrific jump in demand for its server solutions, leading to rapid growth in the company's top and bottom lines. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAnd now, a recent revelation from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggests that Supermicro's eye-popping growth will continue.\n\nNvidia's adoption of liquid-cooled systems should give Super Micro Computer a boost\n\nNvidia's current flagship AI graphics card, the H100, reportedly performs well under air cooling. What's more, the upcoming H200 processor is also anticipated to perform optimally while being air-cooled, according to Tom's Hardware. But at an economic summit at Stanford this week, Huang said that one of Nvidia's next-generation computers is going to be liquid-cooled.\n\nNvidia's next-generation AI graphics processing units (GPUs) based on the Blackwell architecture are expected to consume 40% more power than the existing offerings based on the Hopper architecture. According to some other claims, Nvidia's next-generation AI chips could even consume double the power of the current lineup. This is where liquid-cooled server systems are going to come into the picture.\n\nWhen launching what Supermicro claimed to be the first liquid-cooled server systems for Nvidia's H100 processors last year, the company said:\n\nSavings for a data center are estimated to be 40% for power when using Supermicro liquid cooling solutions compared to an air-cooled data center. In addition, up to 86% reduction in direct cooling costs compared to existing data centers may be realized.\n\nStory continues\n\nA look at third-party studies suggests something similar. Liquid cooling reportedly consumes just 20% of the energy required for air cooling. In other words, liquid cooling is known to reduce energy consumption in data centers significantly, while also helping reduce operating expenses by using less water than air-cooled data centers.\n\nSupermicro seems to have been ahead of the curve, as it took the initiative to launch liquid-cooling solutions for Nvidia's AI chips last year. The company is now working to boost the manufacturing capacity of liquid-cooled server racks. On its January earnings conference call, Supermicro management remarked: \"By this June quarter, we will have high-volume, dedicated capacity for manufacturing 100-kilowatt to 120-kilowatt racks with liquid-cooling capabilities, providing DLC, direct liquid cooling racks capacity, up to 1,500 racks per month, and our total rack production capacity will be up to 5,000 racks per month by then.\"\n\nThe company's focus on expanding its capacity of liquid-cooled servers will not only let it take advantage of Nvidia's power-hungry AI chips but also allow it to make a dent in the fast-growing market for liquid-cooled data centers as a whole. The liquid-cooled data center market is expected to generate annual revenue of $40 billion in 2033, compared with just $4.5 billion last year, clocking an annual growth rate of 24% over the next decade.\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see Supermicro maintaining its healthy pace of growth for a long time to come.\n\nThe stock's valuation makes buying it a no-brainer\n\nThough Supermicro has been on a tear on the stock market over the past year, its sales multiple stands at just 6.7. That's cheaper than the technology sector's price-to-sales ratio of 7.1. Moreover, Supermicro's forward earnings multiple of 36 points toward a big jump in its bottom line, considering its trailing earnings multiple of 84.\n\nAs the following chart suggests, Supermicro's earnings are set to take off big time from the previous fiscal year's reading of $11.81 per share. SMCI EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nIt's also worth noting that analysts have raised their earnings growth expectations from the company, and there's a good chance that they may keep raising those estimates considering added catalysts such as the growing demand for liquid-cooled systems. That's why now would be a good time for investors to buy this AI stock, as it seems capable of sustaining its stunning rally in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Beyond the \"Magnificent Seven\": 3 Brilliant Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks With Explosive Upside Potential",
        "content": "Last year was something of a coming-out party for artificial intelligence (AI), as Wall Street and Main Street alike were introduced to the capabilities of AI's next-generation algorithms. It didn't take investors long to realize that a number of the stock market's best-performing stocks had something in common -- they had AI in their DNA.\n\nBank of America analyst Michael Hartnett coined the term \"Magnificent Seven,\" from the 1960 film of the same name, to describe this group of high-growth stocks, listed in alphabetical order:\n\nAlphabet Amazon Apple Meta Platforms Microsoft Nvidia Tesla\n\nIt's easy to see how these market leaders were lumped together, but the intense focus on these stocks can be myopic, particularly if done to the exclusion of all others. Don't get me wrong: I own shares of all of the Magnificent Seven stocks and don't have plans to sell any of them. That said, I believe there are compelling opportunities outside this septet.\n\nLet's look at three AI stocks that have the potential to deliver explosive upside -- that are not part of the Magnificent Seven. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Arm Holdings\n\nArm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) is best known for creating the blueprints for many of the world's most widely used central processing units (CPUs). The company's designs are ubiquitous, reaching into every area of technology, most notably cloud computing, hyperscale computing, and data centers.\n\nThis positioning gave the company the inside track when generative AI emerged last year, as a great deal of AI processing will be done in the cloud and data centers. Arm's most recent (read: most lucrative) designs are all the rage as data center operators scramble to upgrade to more robust processors necessary to handle the rigors of AI. Take Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, for example. It combines accelerated CPU and GPU technology to meet that need,employing 144 of Arm's top-of-the-line version 9 (V9) CPU cores.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 third quarter, ended Dec. 31, Arm generated record revenue of $824 million, up 14% year over year. That performance was fueled by license revenue that grew 18% and record royalty revenue that jumped 11%. It also drove adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $0.29, a 32% increase. However, the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO), which provides a glimpse into sales trends, illustrates Arm's future potential. RPO climbed 38% year over year to $2.43 billion, suggesting its accelerating growth has just begun.\n\nArm stock might seem expensive using the most popular valuation metrics, which fail to factor in its growth trajectory. However, its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio clocks in at less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nWhile Arm handles the CPU part of the AI equation, Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, provides the specialty servers designed to handle the rigors of AI. Supermicro offers a variety of high-end servers that sport cutting-edge AI processors from the likes of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\n\nFurthermore, the company's focus on energy efficiency is the stuff of legend. Since AI systems require a deal of juice to process, Supermicro systems have enjoyed a commensurate spike in demand, which is evident in its recent financial results.\n\nFor the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended Dec. 31, Supermicro generated record revenue that surged 103% year over year to $3.66 billion, while diluted EPS soared 85% to $5.10.\n\nIf that weren't enough, management's forecast calls for its growth to accelerate, guiding for third-quarter revenue of $3.9 billion at the midpoint, representing 205% year-over-year growth.\n\nLike Arm, Supermicro's valuation looks stretched when using the price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratio, the two most commonly employed valuation metrics. Yet its forward PEG ratio, which factors in its accelerating growth, comes in at less than 1, suggesting it's a bargain.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is no stranger to AI. The company hung out its shingle more than two decades ago, with the initial goal of helping the U.S. government stop terrorists in their tracks. The company has since expanded its mandate, providing enterprise-level businesses with data mining and business analytics services fueled by AI.\n\nThat expertise in AI made Palantir the first stop for many companies looking to adopt generative AI, and the company pivoted to meet that need. The fruit of its efforts was the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a system designed to help businesses identify their most mission-critical needs and automate the solutions. By working side by side with Palantir's engineers, users build customized AI-powered tools to suit their needs. Furthermore, Palantir's intensive boot camp helps companies develop solutions in as little as one to five days.\n\nThe company's success was evident in its most recent results. In the fourth quarter, revenue of $608 million marked a 20% year-over-year jump, while its EPS of $0.04 quadrupled. However, U.S. commercial revenue, which includes AIP, grew 70% year over year, while the company's total contract value soared 107%. As a result, Palantir's forecast calls for U.S. commercial revenue to grow by at least 40% in 2024, though management's guidance tends to be conservative.\n\nLike Arm and Supermicro, Palantir sports a forward PEG ratio of less than 1, suggesting the stock is undervalued.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Insiders Sold US$27m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy",
        "content": "The fact that multiple Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Founder, Charles Liang, sold US$13m worth of shares at a price of US$252 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$1,069. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 0.9% of Charles Liang's holding.\n\nOver the last year we saw more insider selling of Super Micro Computer shares, than buying. The average sell price was around US$303. It's not too encouraging to see that insiders have sold at below the current price. But we wouldn't put too much weight on the insider selling. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsiders At Super Micro Computer Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nWe've seen more insider selling than insider buying at Super Micro Computer recently. In total, insiders sold US$6.6m worth of shares in that time. Meanwhile Independent Director Shiu Chan bought US$1.1m worth. The share price has moved a bit recently, but it's hard to argue that the selling is a positive.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Super Micro Computer\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Super Micro Computer insiders own 15% of the company, worth about US$8.9b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Super Micro Computer Tell Us?\n\nThe stark truth for Super Micro Computer is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Super Micro Computer makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Super Micro Computer (including 2 which are a bit unpleasant).\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "The area of artificial intelligence (AI) is hot right now, but that doesn't mean it's a short-term investment opportunity. You could score an even bigger win by choosing quality AI players and holding them for the long term as they take part in a potential AI revolution.\n\nThis technology could transform many industries. However, these changes won't happen overnight, which means AI players can benefit every step of the way.\n\nTwo companies, in particular, make great long-term AI buys because they're powering AI projects. Without these companies' products and services, many programs might not unfold as efficiently or successfully as they're unfolding today. These players provide the chips, servers, and other behind-the-scenes elements that are crucial to AI -- and their earnings have taken off in recent years.\n\nLet's take a closer look at these two AI powerhouses to buy and hold for the next decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) play an essential role in the realm of AI. They power the training and inference processes that are absolutely crucial if you want an AI model to carry out its job down the road of solving complex problems. Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest around, but the company isn't resting on its laurels. Instead, it's investing in research and development to remain ahead.\n\nThe efforts are working. Nvidia aims to launch its new H200 chip in the second quarter of this year and is readying a new chip architecture known as Blackwell, along with the B100 chip for launch possibly later this year.\u00a0Today, Nvidia holds 80% of the AI chip market, and this dominance is likely to continue due to the company's brand strength and will to keep innovating.\n\nEven better, Nvidia doesn't only sell chips -- the company offers a broad range of AI products and services that are available through the world's biggest cloud companies like Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Nvidia has built a complete platform and expertise in AI, making it the go-to provider for companies aiming to develop projects in this market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis expertise has helped Nvidia report record earnings in recent times, with sales and net income climbing in the triple digits. And even though Nvidia shares have taken off, they still trade at only 36x times forward earnings estimates, a reasonable price considering the company's strength in this high-growth market.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is another behind-the-scenes AI superstar. The company has been around for 30 years, but only in recent times has it seen earnings and share performance take off -- thanks to its AI business. Supermicro provides servers, workstations, full rack scale solutions, and more to customers in the AI space.\n\nA few things help Supermicro stand out. The company uses a building block architecture, meaning it uses common elements across platforms so it can quickly assemble products for clients. This also allows it to incorporate the latest technology into its products. Speaking of this, Supermicro works hand in hand with the world's top chipmakers, including Nvidia, so that it knows about upcoming chip launches and can immediately make the latest innovations available in its offerings.\n\nSupermicro also offers customers a vast selection of configurations in order to tailor their orders to their needs.\n\nAll of this has helped Supermicro score a huge victory in the AI market. Just recently, the company reported its first $3 billion quarter -- that's higher than revenue for the entire year back in 2021.\n\nChief Executive Officer Charles Liang said the company's numerous customer wins now are resulting in increasing demand. Liang says he expects AI growth to continue for many quarters and possibly many years. If he's right, earnings and share-price performance may just be getting started.\n\nSupermicro trades for 54x forward earnings estimates. This may not seem cheap but it's actually a fair price for a company playing a key role in a high-growth industry. Supermicro's standout strategy could help this player continue to win over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "There have never been more millionaires than today. In fact, according to Statista, there are more than 22 million millionaires in the U.S. alone. That's up from fewer than 8 million in 2000.\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the biggest reasons for the rising number of millionaires is the stock market.\n\nSo, what are some artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that might help push that figure even higher? I have my eye on three. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nFirst up is Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR). Up 239% in only 12 months, Palantir is well on its way to making plenty of shareholders wealthier.\n\nThe company operates a data analytics platform that serves two segments: government and commercial.\n\nIts government clients include the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.K. National Health Services, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Commercial clients include MorganStanley, Airbus, and Merck.\n\nBusiness is booming, as evidenced by the company's fourth-quarter earnings report. Highlights from that report included:\n\nOverall revenue growth of 20% year over year. U.S. commercial revenue growth of 70% year over year. U.S. commercial customer count growth of 55% year over year. Free cash flow of $731 million over the last 12 months.\n\nIn short, businesses (particularly American ones) are racing to sign up for Palantir's AI-driven data analysis. Many organizations -- and their leadership -- find it tough to cut through the haze of data they produce, making it difficult to spot trends and identify opportunities. Palantir offers a remedy -- making it a company worth remembering for long-term growth-oriented investors.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nArguably the hottest stock on Wall Street, SuperMicroComputer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has climbed an eye-popping 1,060% over the last 12 months -- meaning a $1,000 investment last March would have grown to nearly $12,000 today.\n\nThe company makes much of the physical hardware needed to store, cool, and operate cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs). This isn't as straightforward a process as you might imagine -- the H100 GPU, Nvidia's flagship product, is often bundled in groups of eight, with the entire unit weighing between 300 pounds and 400 pounds and generating about as much heat as a patio heater or a commercial convection oven.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's more, with a unit cost of around $40,000 per H100, it should go without saying that the owners of these high-priced GPUs want to get top performance from their new AI chips -- meaning they're willing to pay up for top-of-the-line server racks and accessories.\n\nAs a result, Super Micro Computer's sales are going through the roof.\n\nIn only three years, Super Micro Computer's annual revenue jumped from $3.4 billion to more than $9.2 billion. Moreover, sales are expected to rise to $14.5 billion in 2024 and $19.8 billion in 2025.\n\nGranted, the company's stock has gone parabolic, and it's not a wise choice for every investor. But for those wanting a high-octane growth stock that is riding the AI revolution like no other, Super Micro Computer is a name to consider.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nFinally, there's Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) -- a company that has made its share of millionaires, and even a few billionaires.\n\nCompared to many of the hottest AI stocks, Microsoft's 10% year-to-date return looks like small potatoes. But this is the world's largest company, with a market cap of $3 trillion. What's more, its track record since CEO Satya Nadella took the helm 10 years ago is fantastic. Under his leadership, Microsoft has grown its annual revenue from $83 billion to $228 billion as its focus shifted to the cloud. MSFT Revenue (TTM) ChartMSFT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nIn addition, the company continues to innovate. Its latest creation is Copilot for Microsoft 365. As the company puts it:\n\n\"Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with your organization's data -- all in the flow of work -- to turn your words into one of the most powerful productivity tools on the planet.\"\n\nIn practice, this means users will now be able to access real-time, AI-powered tools that are integrated into popular programs such as Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint. That should drive real-world productivity gains for individuals and businesses -- further cementing Microsoft 365's place as the must-have business software suite.\n\nTo sum up, Microsoft is the biggest company for a reason. Moreover, given its strong leadership, innovative products, and massive scale, its stock is likely to keep producing millionaires for a long time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "At a New All-Time High, Is Super Micro Computer Stock Still a Buy?",
        "content": "One of the crown jewels of the artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro. The stock generated blistering gains of 246% in 2023 but is already up an astonishing 301% so far this year, as of the market close on Friday, regularly notching new all-time highs.\n\nThe company, best known for its specialty servers used to facilitate AI processing, has emerged as an odds-on favorite in the movement, stealing market share from its larger rivals.\n\nThis leaves investors in a dilemma. After clocking 1,290% gains in roughly 14 months, is Supermicro stock still a buy? Let's dig in to see what the evidence suggests. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow Supermicro became the gold standard\n\nWhile Supermicro might seem like an overnight success, the company has been manufacturing servers for more than 30 years. The company has long delivered custom servers outfitted with the latest and greatest technology, but by focusing on energy efficiency, it lowers the total cost of ownership for its customers. Supermicro's rack-scale plug-and-play solutions and building block architecture allows customers to buy what they need and easily increase the size of their system as required.\n\nFurthermore, by offering free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air-cooling technology, Supermicro offers AI-centric server solutions for every budget and technology level.\n\nThe company is able to accomplish this feat by working closely with its suppliers, including Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices, to ensure its servers work seamlessly with the industry's most up-to-the-minute AI-centric processors. It also ensures the company has access to critical supply components.\n\nSupermicro isn't stopping there. The company has taken a number of steps to position itself for the future. The company is expanding its manufacturing facilities both here and abroad, which will increase its economies of scale and give Supermicro the capacity to serve a total addressable market of $25 billion -- well ahead of its trailing-12-month revenue of roughly $9.3 billion. Supermicro also just floated $1.5 billion in convertible notes to help fund and accelerate its manufacturing expansion to meet the growing demand for AI solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Supermicro has been using its expertise in the AI market to steal market share from its rivals. Barclays analyst George Wang suggests that Supermicro \"has 7% market share globally, implying further share gains ahead are likely.\" In his opinion, Supermicro is taking share from the likes of Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and that power shift is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nSupermicro's growth is off the charts\n\nThe aforementioned race to adopt AI has supercharged Supermicro's growth. For the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended Dec. 31, Supermicro generated record revenue that soared to $3.66 billion, up 103% year over year and 73% sequentially. At the same time, diluted earnings per share surged 85% to $5.10.\n\nManagement expects the company's growth spurt to accelerate. Supermicro is guiding third-quarter revenue to $3.9 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would represent 205% year-over-year growth.\n\nCEO Charles Liang went even further, saying, \"I feel very confident that this AI boom will continue for... many quarters, if not many years.\" If he's right, and I believe he is, there's a long runway for growth ahead for Supermicro.\n\nIs Supermicro stock expensive?\n\nSupermicro stock has been on fire since the beginning of 2023, so it stands to reason that the stock's valuation would have increased accordingly. And at first glance, that appears to be the case.\n\nBased on its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 89, the stock appears wildly expensive, more than triple the average valuation of the S&P 500 index. Furthermore, at 7 times sales, the stock still appears expensive, as a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is generally considered to be between 1 and 2. The two most commonly employed valuation metrics seem to suggest the stock is simply too expensive, but that view is myopic.\n\nWhy? Because both these metrics look to the past and fail to consider Supermicro's triple-digit growth story. For that, we turn to the more fitting price/earnings-to-growth ratio, which values Supermicro at less than 1, the benchmark for an undervalued stock.\n\nSince the market is forward looking, investors should endeavor to know not only where a stock has been in terms of valuation, but where it's going as well.\n\nA vast and growing opportunity\n\nIt's been just over a year since generative AI first burst on the scene, and adoption continues to accelerate thanks to the productivity gains AI has made possible. And novel use cases are still being discovered at a rapid clip.\n\nEstimates regarding the potential size of the AI market abound, but one moderate view suggests that generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nTo be clear, I think Supermicro's streak of triple-digit gains should end within the coming year, giving way to more moderate, though still impressive, growth. However, the breadth of Supermicro's AI-centric server offerings and ongoing market gains, combined with a massive opportunity and reasonable price tag, suggests investors should at least consider buying the stock and picking up shares on any weakness.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush is not over. Companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) are generating staggering returns on the back of excellent and ever-growing financial metrics. Yet, AI stocks are becoming increasingly crowded and expensive, with everyone clamoring to get a slice. Prudent investors are starting to look further afield for undervalued AI stocks\u2014which might be harder than it sounds since almost every tech company is moving into the AI space. That is why we\u2019ve collated the three most promising and undervalued AI stocks and laid out why you should consider them as your next buy.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCompanies that offer AI-powered supply chain management are in for a great year. Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) does that and more, offering robotic software and hardware platforms that map out storage or distribution facilities and automate packing, storage, and retrieval functions. The company aims to reduce delivery time from providers to end users through its Symbiotic platform, regardless of the scale of operations. SYM provides services to distribution centers for groceries, general merchandise, wholesale food, footwear, apparel, and food and beverage suppliers.\n\nSo, let me explain why SYM is a great undervalued AI stock. First, its stock currently trades at around $44, while analysts give it a strong buy recommendation and about a $20 upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSecond, the company is doing quite well financially. Their latest reports showcased an almost 80% increase in revenue YoY, from $206 million to $369 million. The company is still operating at a net loss\u2014$13 million, to be exact. However, it\u2019s already registered its second quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA, signaling a move toward profitability. In line with these positive results, management is confident that the trend will continue in Q2 2024. Revenue is expected to fall between $400 million and $420 million, and adjusted EBITDA is expected to end between $12 million and $15 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nUiPath Inc (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike with Symbiotic, UiPath (NYSE:PATH) is offering automation platforms. However, PATH is focused on the workforce and enterprise institutions. Its SaaS platform provides several resources, including \u201cDiscover\u201d (process, task, and communications mining, prioritizing data analysis for sales and KPI opportunities), \u201cAutomate\u201d (UI and API automation, generative AI, and process automation), and \u201cOperate\u201d (real-time analytics and unified management platforms).\n\nThe company\u2019s services cover various industries and specialties, including banking, healthcare, and insurance. It also provides department-specific automation services, like HR, IT, and customer service.\n\nWhat makes me bullish about PATH is its improving financials. Q3\u201924 reported a 24% YoY growth for both revenue and ARR. ARR, in particular, reached $1.38 billion. A closer look into its financials indicates a consistent ARR growth, with an estimated 35% CAGR going back to 2022.\n\nIts customer base is also growing, with the number of large customers spending $100k yearly reaching 1,947. Meanwhile, million-dollar customers have grown from 201 to 264 YoY. The company\u2019s guidance reflects this growth; revenue is anticipated to reach $381 million and $386 million next quarter, while ARR is expected to reach $1.455 billion on the high end.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia is the reigning king of AI stocks, and anything it touches turns to gold. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is one of the many companies Nvidia is invested in, potentially making it a great addition to your undervalued AI stocks list.\n\nSOUND offers an Only Voice AI platform to deliver more natural conversations to users. Its platform stands out, as it performs natural language processing and automatic speech recognition simultaneously, providing faster and more accurate answers. SOUN\u2019s platform can be used for restaurant order-taking, hospitality management, marketing, transcription, automatic content recognition, and more.\n\nIt also has a music app that can identify songs sung by the user. That music app might seem small in the grand scheme of things, but the underlying technology is impressive and showcases the platform\u2019s capability and potential applications.\n\nNow \u2013 it would be unfair to recommend SOUN solely because of its ties with Nvidia. The thing is, SoundHouse stands on its own two feet just fine. Revenue reached $17.15 million last quarter, signifying an impressive 80% growth YoY. Like with early startups, the company is still operating at a loss, yet we\u2019re seeing narrowing numbers that are getting closer to profitability.

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Super Micro Computer Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, has become a fan-favorite for artificial intelligence (AI) investors over the past year or so. Since Jan. 2023, the stock has surged 1,290%.\n\nThe company supplies high-end, energy-efficient servers designed to enable high-performance computing, hyperscale data centers, and AI. The advent of generative AI has resulted in accelerating demand as businesses race to profit from this paradigm shift. This, in turn, has translated into surging financial results and a skyrocketing share price for Supermicro.\n\nNow that the stage is set, let's look at four reasons to buy Supermicro stock like there's no tomorrow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Supermicro has gone parabolic over the past year, and growth is expected to accelerate\n\nSupermicro has long been a key player in the server market, but its growth over the past year has been unprecedented.\n\nA quick review of Supermicro's recent results paints a compelling picture. For the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), it generated record revenue that soared 103% year over year to $3.7 billion. At the same time, diluted earnings per share (EPS) surged 85% to $5.10.\n\nIf that weren't enough, management suggests demand will continue to accelerate. Supermicro is guiding for third-quarter revenue of $3.9 billion at the midpoint of its outlook, which would represent year-over-year growth of 205% -- and that could end up being conservative if history is any guide.\n\n2. Supermicro will benefit from a significant upgrade cycle\n\nThe advent of AI sparked the beginning of a massive data center upgrade cycle. Existing data center servers aren't equipped with the computational horsepower necessary to withstand the rigors of AI. Fearing they will be left behind, data center operators are spending at a breakneck pace to increase the capabilities of their operations.\n\nEstimates suggest this will result in more than $1 trillion in upgrades over the next several years. As one of the leading providers of AI-centric servers, Supermicro is well positioned to ride these secular tailwinds higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Bank of America analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya suggests that demand for AI servers will be much greater in the coming years than many believe. He believes this demand will grow at a compound annual rate of 50% over the next three years, while Supermicro's revenue could \"grow even faster.\"\n\n3. Supermicro is stealing market share from its rivals\n\nEven as overall demand for AI-centric servers is increasing, Supermicro is stealing share from the incumbents. Late last year, Barclays analyst George Wang noted that Supermicro's \"superior design capability and strong AI partnerships\" would help drive market share gains. \"[Supermicro] has 7% market share globally, implying further share gains ahead are likely,\" Wang said. He further suggested the company is taking share from larger competitors, including Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n\nRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann sees that trend accelerating too. \"We expect Supermicro to achieve significant market share gains, potentially reaching double digits in the next few years from its current mid-single digits with a special emphasis on enterprise solutions,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\n\n4. Supermicro has a surprisingly affordable valuation\n\nExcitement about the potential represented by AI has investors flocking to AI stocks, which has driven valuations on many popular companies higher than they've been in years. Supermicro hasn't been immune to this phenomenon, but the stock is still surprisingly cheap.\n\nThe stock is currently selling for about 3 times next year's sales (fiscal 2025). While that looks relatively inexpensive, even that figure doesn't take into account the company's surging profits. Using the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio shows a valuation of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this server technology company have returned +54%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, which Super Micro falls in, has gained 33.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nSuper Micro is expected to post earnings of $5.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +246%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $21.71 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +83.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.60 indicates a change of +31.7% from what Super Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +14.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Super Micro.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Super Micro, the consensus sales estimate of $3.9 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +204%. The $14.5 billion and $18.27 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +103.5% and +26%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nSuper Micro reported revenues of $3.66 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +103.3%. EPS of $5.59 for the same period compares with $3.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.21 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +14.02%. The EPS surprise was +2.01%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Super Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nSuper Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Super Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Must-Buy Soaring Tech Giants With More Upside in Near Term",
        "content": "The tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. This theme continues to dominate Wall Street\u2019s investment strategy in 2024. Year to date, out of the 11 sectors of the broad-market index the S&P 500 \u2013 technology, and its close resemblance, communication services \u2013 have rallied 7.7% and 9.5%, respectively.\n\nThe benchmark itself has advanced 7.4% year to date. Moreover, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has appreciated 8.9% in the same period. Grand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nOther Catalyst\n\nRecently Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his testimony before the Senate after appearing before the House of Representatives a day before. On Mar 6, Powell said the central bank is likely to initiate interest rate cuts this year but not any time soon. However, on Mar 7, he indicated that interest rate cuts may not be too far off if the inflation rate moves in line with the Fed\u2019s expectations in the near future.\n\nPer Powell, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting to become more confident that inflation is moving sustainably at 2%. When we do get that confidence, and we\u2019re not far from it, it\u2019ll be appropriate to begin to dial back the level of restriction.\u201d\n\nThe CME FedWatch currently shows a 74.6% probability of a 25-basis point rate cut in the June FOMC meeting. The interest rate derivative tool also shows at least two more rate cuts of 25-basis points before the end of 2024. A lower interest rate regime will be most beneficial for high-growth sectors like technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths with strong potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp.\u2019s NVDA Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA\u2019s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 68.1% and 79.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 15.3% over the last 30 days. The stock price of NVDA has jumped 76.7% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA\u2019s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 are likely to aid its growth. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 30 days. The stock price of META has surged 42.9% year to date.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. SMCI designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture. SMCI\u2019s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI emphasizes superior product design and uncompromising quality control to produce industry-leading serverboards, chassis and server systems.\n\nThese Server Building Block Solutions provide benefits across many environments, including data center deployment, high-performance computing, high-end workstations, storage networks and standalone server installations. SMCI sells its server systems and components primarily through distributors, which include value-added resellers and system integrators, and to a lesser extent, to original equipment manufacturers.\n\nSuper Micro Computer has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of more than 100% and 83.8%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days. The stock price of SMCI has soared 301% year to date.\n\nVeeva Systems Inc.\u2019s VEEV continued focus on research and development and a strong product portfolio buoy optimism. VEEV has also been witnessing robust customer adoption of its products, which is encouraging.\n\nVEEV has inked a few strategic alliances over the past few months. A strong liquidity position is an added plus. Per the Zacks Model, total revenues and adjusted earnings per share are likely to witness a CAGR of 12.8% and 11.7% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026, respectively.\n\nVeeva Systems has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.9% and 23.1%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.9% over the last seven days. The stock price of VEEV has advanced 18.3% year to date.\n\nAppLovin Corp. APP is engaged in building a software-based platform for mobile app developers to enhance the marketing and monetization of their apps in the United States and internationally. APP provides a technology platform that enables developers to market, monetize, analyze and publish their apps.\n\nAppLovin has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 23.2% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Super Micro Computer Stock?",
        "content": "It's an artificial intelligence (AI) market -- we're just living in it. Anything associated with AI has soared in the last year, along with any perceived \"winner\" from the AI revolution that we may or may not be currently experiencing.\n\nJust look at Nvidia. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is up over 250% in the past year, making it the third-largest company in the world by market cap.\n\nBut there is a hotter AI stock than even Nvidia. Enter Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). The stock of the data center builder and service provider is up 1,000% in the last 12 months and nearly 6,000% in the last five years as companies turn to it for AI infrastructure buildouts.\n\nIs it too late to buy Super Micro Computer stock? Let's take a look and find out.\n\nWhat the heck does Super Micro Computer do?\n\nSuper Micro Computer specializes in assembling customers' computer servers for data centers, cloud computing, AI, and edge computing. It also sells software services to help run these packaged systems.\n\nThis is valuable for two key reasons. First, assembling modern computing architecture is complex and requires engineering expertise. Not every company can do this on its own and therefore looks to outsource this to contractors like Super Micro.\n\nSecond, efficiency in computing can mean huge cost savings. There are hundreds of billions of dollars spent on computing infrastructure every year. If Super Micro can build products even slightly more efficiently than the competition, that could mean billions of dollars in customer savings.\n\nToday, that means taking computer chips from the likes of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and others to assemble fast and efficient data centers that power AI tools. The company is emerging as the clear leader in this category with projected revenue of about $14.5 billion for this fiscal year. Three years ago, Super Micro generated just $3.6 billion in revenue.\n\nFast growth, low margins, inconsistent cash flow\n\nWith such rapid growth, Super Micro has been declared an AI winner. Its stock is soaring and now boasts a market cap of $56.2 billion. With revenue growing at a triple-digit rate, you might be tempted to think the stock is not that expensive after this recent run-up.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut when you look under the hood, you'll realize revenue is not the best way to value Super Micro. For one, it has a very low gross margin, just 15.5% in its most recent quarter (excluding stock-based compensation).\n\nThis isn't the end of the world -- the company is still profitable -- but it shows that a lot of revenue is just passing along the costs of the computer chips it buys to its data center customers. Using revenue to value this stock will mislead investors.\n\nIt also has inconsistent cash flow generation. Free cash flow has jumped around the last few years and was in fact negative over the last 12 months even with operating income climbing higher.\n\nThis isn't the end of the world, but it will make it more difficult for the company to self-finance its growth ambitions. Compare this to an asset-light business like Nvidia that generates cash flow in line with earnings, and you can see that Super Micro has a less-than-ideal business model. This should not be ignored by investors. SMCI Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nDon't get caught up in the hype\n\nThere's a lot of hype around the company with the stock up 10-fold in just one year. A lot of this hype may be deserved, but don't get blinded by a rising stock: Super Micro is a bad bet right now.\n\nThe stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 88 -- or more than triple the S&P 500 average -- while already seeing a huge boost from the AI revolution. Buying today means you not only believe in the consensus growth from AI and how it will help Super Micro but that it will be significantly bigger than most people think. Is that a smart bet to make? I doubt it.\n\nThe stock today comes with a lot of risks and little potential reward. If the AI revolution is real and sustainable, a lot of this growth is already priced into the stock. And if it's a bubble? Watch out -- investors could be in for one rude awakening. Avoid Super Micro Computer at these prices.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "You're a very happy investor if you've owned Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) over the past year. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's stock is up 530%, while Supermicro's has risen an astounding 1,300%.\n\nIn other words, if you invested $10,000 in each company on Jan. 1, 2023, you'd have nearly $205,000. But after that kind of performance, many investors may wonder if they can still invest in these two AI leaders without the risk of losing serious capital in just a few months.\n\nSo, are either of these two stocks a buy right now? And if so, which is the better purchase?\n\nNvidia and Super Micro Computer are not competitors\n\nNvidia makes best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) that are perfect for training AI models. GPUs can process intense calculations efficiently, making them the best tool for the job. When a client wants to build a supercomputer capable of training AI models, it doesn't order a handful of GPUs; it orders thousands. With Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, costing an estimated $30,000 a piece, that's a massive growth driver for Nvidia.\n\nHowever, you can't just connect these GPUs together with a few cables and call it a day. You need a specialized server that properly networks these devices and combines them in clusters to maximize efficiency. That's where Super Micro Computer comes in.\n\nWhile some tech giants may have this expertise in-house, many do not, so they contract Supermicro to build their servers. Supermicro has many different server designs based on the application and expected workload size, so customers of all varieties can find what they need.\n\nThis highlights the first difference between these two investments: Nvidia is a company that nearly all AI-focused businesses work with, while only some work with Supermicro. This doesn't mean Supermicro is doomed to fail, but it is a risk factor investors should consider. Supermicro could be dethroned by a competitor undercutting pricing, while Nvidia might only be knocked off its pedestal by someone creating a more powerful GPU -- something competitors have been struggling to do for a long time.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen examining each company's financials, Nvidia also starts to pull away.\n\nNvidia's stock is cheaper than Supermicro's\n\nBoth companies are growing rapidly, and their projections for the next quarter are also quite strong. In Q4 of FY 2024 (ending Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue rose 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. It also gave guidance for Q1 revenue of $24 billion, indicating 234% growth.\n\nSupermicro also delivered strong results, with its Q2 FY 2024 (ending Dec. 31) revenue rising 103% to $3.67 billion. For its next quarter, Supermicro projects growth of 188% to 219%, placing it in the same realm as Nvidia.\n\nWhile Nvidia experienced the first wave of GPU demand, Supermicro's growth is just starting. However, the stock already responded with strong price appreciation because investors know what kind of growth to expect based on Nvidia's performance over the past year.\n\nAs a result, Supermicro's stock is much more expensive than Nvidia's on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) basis. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nUsing a forward P/E ratio when a company is undergoing a massive change is wise, as it uses analyst projections to value it. There is still room for error (as no one has a crystal ball), but it gives investors an idea of what they're paying for.\n\nBecause Nvidia is cheaper from this metric and has stronger growth and vital product positioning, I think it's a much better buy than Super Micro Computer.\n\nShould the strong AI demand persist for a few years, both stocks could be excellent picks, but Nvidia remains the king of AI investment opportunities right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has been on an incredible run over the last year, and it's attracting lots of attention on Wall Street. On Monday, Goldman Sachs analysts published a note initiating coverage on Supermicro. The investment firm assigned a \"neutral\" rating on the stock, indicating that it does not recommend buying or selling shares right now.\n\nGoldman's analysts also put a one-year price target of $941 per share on the stock. With the artificial intelligence (AI) stock priced at roughly $1,140 per share, that would imply potential downside of 17% over the next year. Has Supermicro stock become too risky?\n\nCan Supermicro stock keep rising or is it time to sell?\n\nIn Goldman's note on Supermicro, the analysts indicate that the massive run-up for the server specialist's valuation has been warranted. The analysts pointed to the company's strengths in the high-performance server market and status as an \"AI winner\" with valuable business relationships as legitimate catalysts for its incredible stock gains. Supermicro's share price is up more than 1,000% over the last year.\n\nOn the other hand, Goldman now thinks that most of the positive near-term growth catalysts are already priced into the stock. Given that Super Micro Computer stock is trading at roughly 52 times this year's expected earnings, the stage may be set for shares to see some volatility in the near term. Of course, the stock could go on to deliver stronger long-term performance, even if Goldman's team winds up being exactly correct with its pricing forecast.\n\nExplosive gains have pushed Supermicro stock to more speculative valuation levels, but the business's outlook is evolving in very favorable directions. I wouldn't recommend selling the stock right now.\n\nFor investors with high-risk tolerance, I think taking a buy-and-hold approach to the stock could still have substantial payoffs. But investors should take a balanced approach to constructing their portfolio of AI stocks and avoid betting too heavily on any single name or making huge investments all at once -- particularly in cases where valuations have seen dramatic run-ups.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "If you've been investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, then you're doubtless familiar with Nvidia. The chipmaker develops powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) that can be used to power accelerated computing, machine learning, and a variety of generative AI applications.\n\nAnother company that has been garnering much enthusiasm from investors is Nvidia's cohort, Super Micro Computing(NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nUnlike Nvidia, Supermicro does not design or manufacture chips. Instead, it designs integrated systems for IT architecture, including storage clusters and server racks. The boom in demand for GPUs over the last year has served as a tailwind for Supermicro -- its revenue is currently growing by over 100% annually.\n\nBut that's not all -- the good news just keeps on rolling in for Supermicro. After trading hours on Friday, news broke that Supermicro will be joining the S&P 500. Shares surged 12% post-market and are now nearing all-time highs.\n\nWhile this is quite an impressive achievement, does this make Supermicro stock a buy?\n\nSupermicro is growing exponentially, but...\n\nWhile estimates vary, some Wall Street research suggests that Nvidia in 2023 held 98% of the data center GPU market. Demand for its A100 and H100 GPUs is extraordinarily high. Given Supermicro's close ties to Nvidia, it's not surprising to see that it, too, experienced steep sales growth in recent quarters. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nIndeed, in light of its critical role in integrated data center services, George Tsilis of TD Ameritrade has labeled Supermicro a \"stealth Nvidia.\" However, there is much more to the investment case than just its top-line growth. Image Source: Getty Images\n\n...margins and competition could become problematic.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 second quarter, which ended Dec. 31, Supermicro reported a gross margin of 15.4%. That was a decline from both the prior quarter and the same period in the prior year. Moreover, the company's current margin profile is in line with its 10-year average -- not growing in tandem with revenue.\n\nStory continues SMCI Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nManagement attributed margin deterioration to more aggressive investments in IT design and market share acquisition. This approach should be OK for now. But in the long run, Supermicro needs to demonstrate that it can expand its margins and cash flows. Otherwise, a liquidity crunch could arise.\n\nOne threat that could continue putting strain on Supermicro's margin profile is competition in the semiconductor space. Other AI leaders, including Microsoft and Amazon, are entering the AI chip market. Nvidia's near-total dominance in the market could start eroding sooner than later.\n\nIt would behoove Supermicro to foster relationships with other chip designers, as its growth cannot hinge solely on demand for Nvidia's products in the long run.\n\nShould you invest in Super Micro Computer stock?\n\nOne of the things I've warned about regarding Supermicro is that the stock often trades in tandem with Nvidia. While this may seem like it makes sense, it could eventually become dangerous. They are entirely different businesses. Moreover, Nvidia's top line is growing at much faster rates than Supermicro's -- and the chipmaker is far more profitable.\n\nSupermicro as a business is not really comparable to Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices. Rather, it competes with the likes of Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, and even IBM to some degree. SMCI PS Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nAt a price-to-sales ratio of 5.6, Supermicro is trading at a noticeable premium to that of its peers. This is not to say that Supermicro is a poor investment choice, per se. Many investors have made a lot of money from the stock over the last year. But that doesn't mean you should follow the crowd at this point.\n\nGiven Supermicro's pending addition to the S&P 500 on March 18 (when S&P Global conducts its standard quarterly rebalance), I suspect the company will now get much more attention from institutional investors. This would be a good thing for shareholders in the long run, as a more diverse set of opinions will enter the discussion around Supermicro and its long-term prospects.\n\nI think it's going to take years to get a concrete idea of which companies will emerge as long-term winners in artificial intelligence. For this reason, I think a prudent strategy would be to keep an eye on Supermicro's operating performance and see if the company can maintain its momentum. But given the activity fueling its shares higher by the day, I think I'd wait this one out for now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Super Micro Computer Stock?",
        "content": "Spurred by surging demand for servers to support artificial intelligence (AI) applications, Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has become one of the market's hottest stocks. The high-performance server specialist's share price has rocketed nearly 300% higher across 2024's trading alone, and it's up a staggering 1000% over the past year. Most recently, the AI stock surged on news that it is being added to the S&P 500 index.\n\nWhile the company's business performance has ramped up dramatically, the stock's incredible gains naturally raise valuation questions. Is it too late to buy this explosive AI stock, or is it on track to serve up even bigger wins?\n\nWhat's powering Supermicro's massive stock gains?\n\nIt's no secret that AI stocks are red hot, and Supermicro (as it's commonly known) has benefited from the strong business results at Nvidia. Supermicro uses Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) in its high-performance rack servers, and excitement surrounding the GPU leader has helped lift the server specialist's valuation. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the valuation gains as being purely hype-driven.\n\nSupermicro has positioned itself as a one-stop shop for AI server solutions. That's a great niche to occupy right now. The company's technologies are used for processing and distributing information for software applications, and demand for its high-performance rack servers has surged in conjunction with the rapidly accelerating adoption of AI applications.\n\nThe company posted sales of $3.66 billion in its fiscal 2024's second quarter, which ended Dec. 31. Revenue in the period was up 103% year over year. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share rose 71.5% year over year to $5.59 per share.\n\nAI has pushed Supermicro into a new growth phase. The key question is how long this cycle will continue and whether or not the company's valuations have become unreasonably stretched.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong growth is poised to continue in the near term\n\nFor its current quarter, Supermicro is guiding for sales of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, which would equate to year-over-year growth of between 188% and 219%. On adjusted earnings per share, it's guiding for a range of $5.20 and $6.01. For comparison, the business posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 in fiscal 2023's third quarter. Hitting the midpoint of its guidance range would mean growing earnings per share by 244% year over year.\n\nGiven recent demand indicators, it actually wouldn't be surprising to see the company's fiscal Q3 sales and earnings exceed the high ends of those guidance ranges. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nTrading at roughly 50 times this year's expected earnings and 36 times next year's expected earnings, Supermicro is a growth-dependent stock. On the other hand, its current valuation actually looks cheap in the context of the business's recent momentum.\n\nNotably, Supermicro currently has a forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of roughly 0.55. Using next year's projected earnings growth rate, the company has a one-year forward PEG ratio of approximately 0.68. For reference, a PEG ratio of less than 1 is generally viewed as a sign that a stock is undervalued because earnings are growing at a rate that can support a higher valuation multiple.\n\nOf course, there is still some uncertainty about how the long-term demand trajectory for Supermicro's\u00a0 offerings will shape up. Investors should understand that its incredible run-up has made the stock a much riskier investment, and it's possible that the company's future performance will fail to live up to the current elevated expectations.\n\nEven so, the stars still seem to be aligning for Supermicro. While it's reasonable to expect that demand for its server technologies will see cyclical moderation at some point, market conditions suggest that the company is poised to enjoy years of strong sales and earnings growth.\n\nThe overall artificial intelligence server market looks poised to continue growing at a rapid clip, and Supermicro appears on track to continue gaining market share. While its stock could see some volatile swings, it still has the makings of a worthwhile portfolio addition for AI-focused investors with above-average risk tolerance.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock is up by a considerable 318% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Super Micro Computer's  ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Super Micro Computer is:\n\n24% = US$732m \u00f7 US$3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's Earnings Growth And 24% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Super Micro Computer has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 8.9% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, Super Micro Computer's considerable five year net income growth of 53% was to be expected.\n\nWe then compared Super Micro Computer's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 14% in the same 5-year period.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for SMCI? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Super Micro Computer Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nGiven that Super Micro Computer doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Super Micro Computer's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

        "title": "Forget the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Consider the \"Terrific Trio.\"",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" have been market leaders since 2023 but are not quite an artificial intelligence (AI)-focused group. While many within the cohort have AI products, they aren't pure plays.\n\nInstead, I'm proposing a new group of three that informs investors on how strong AI demand is. That group, consisting of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which is also a member of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), gives investors a look at the hardware side of AI.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a basket of stocks to track AI infrastructure buildout, this \"Terrific Trio\" is the way to go.\n\nThis trio has their hands in most AI products\n\nStarting at the base, computing hardware requires semiconductor chips, and Taiwan Semiconductor produces the vast majority of them. To produce more powerful chips, manufacturers place the conductive traces closer together, which allows more components to be packed onto a board. To describe these chips, chip manufacturers name them based on how far apart the traces are. Currently, the smallest TSMC can go is 3 nanometers (nm), but it's already working on its 2 nm technology as well.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor makes chips for some of the world's biggest companies and is one of Nvidia's key suppliers.\n\nNvidia gets the most attention of this trio, as its parabolic rise since early 2023 resulted in the stock increasing nearly 500%. This excitement is due to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are best-in-class for training AI models. GPUs are built to process complex calculations like training AI models.\n\nBut what benefits Nvidia is the number of GPUs purchased when a supercomputer is built. These devices require thousands of GPUs to provide users with top-end computing power, and with the rumored price of an H100 GPU coming in at around $30,000 a piece, that generates a lot of revenue for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly is Super Micro Computer. Haphazardly assembling a few hundred or thousand GPUs together without the networking or architecture experience is a recipe for disaster. Many companies without the experience necessary to get the most out of their GPUs go to Supermicro to build their servers.\n\nWith Super Micro Computer's highly modular system, it can spec in a server of just about any size and focus that a client could want.\n\nTogether, these three offer a great pulse on the AI movement, as their products are essential table stakes for getting into the AI game. But they've each had a strong 2024, so is this a good trio to buy right now?\n\nThe trio has had a strong 2024\n\nThis group has been a fantastic one to own in 2024. Supermicro's led the charge, rising more than 280%. NVDA Chart\n\nAfter those numbers, many investors may be worried about overpaying for any of the stocks in this group. However, that argument breaks down if you examine the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (which uses analyst projections over the next 12 months). NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe forward P/E ratio is important when the company you're assessing is going through a massive transformation, like these three are due to AI demand. Additionally, when comparing this metric to a more typical price-to-earnings ratio (which uses trailing earnings to value the company), it's best to take a few points off because these are only projections.\n\nWith that in mind, it's clear that Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are still within the realm of buying, although Supermicro has gotten quite expensive. However, Nvidia's stock also traded for more than 50 times forward earnings in 2023, so Supermicro could grow into its valuation through sustained outsize growth.\n\nSo, should you buy the \"Terrific Trio?\" I'd say yes if you want an absolute pulse on the AI market. But, if you're looking to maximize your portfolio returns, I'd only buy Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, as Supermicro might be due for a pullback after its stellar run to start the year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "How Soon Will Super Micro Computer Stock Hit $2,000?",
        "content": "The past year has been phenomenal for Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) investors; shares of the server manufacturer have shot up a stunning 1,090% over the past 52 weeks. Investors have been buying Supermicro stock hand over fist thanks to the booming demand for its solutions that are being deployed in artificial intelligence (AI) servers.\n\nSupermicro's impending inclusion in the S&P 500 index has further added to investors' enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an all-time high of just over $1,161 following eye-popping gains of 309% just in 2024. Given that Supermicro's share price has quadrupled just over the past two months or so, does it mean that it is a matter of time before it jumps another 72% and hits a stock price of $2,000? Let's find out.\n\nSupermicro's immense growth potential suggests the stock has room to run higher\n\nThough Supermicro (the name its business operates as) has shot up big-time in the past year, it is worth noting that the stock trades at just 5.6 times sales right now. That's surprisingly cheap when you consider that other companies that benefit from AI adoption, such as Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, trade at much higher sales multiples. What's more, Supermicro is currently cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's price-to-sales ratio of 8.45.\n\nThere is still room for the market to reward Supermicro stock with a higher valuation. That won't be surprising considering the company's accelerating growth. When the company released its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results (for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023), it raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion.\n\nInvestors should note that Supermicro originally announced fiscal 2024 revenue guidance of $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion in August last year when it released its fiscal 2023 results. So, the company has increased its full-year revenue guidance by 45% at the midpoint in a space of just two quarters. This also explains why analysts have significantly raised their revenue expectations from Supermicro for fiscal years 2024 and 2025.\n\nStory continues SMCI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAccording to the chart above, Supermicro could generate just over $20 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, which will begin in July this year and end in June 2025. Assuming it does hit that mark and maintains its current price-to-sales ratio after a year, its market cap could jump to $112 billion. That points toward an 87% jump based on Supermicro's current market cap of $60 billion, which is just what the stock needs to hit a price of $2,000.\n\nIn other words, Supermicro stock could hit the $2,000 stock price milestone in the space of just over a year. But don't be surprised to see it deliver even bigger gains as it seems capable of surpassing the $20 billion in annual revenue estimate that analysts have set for it for fiscal 2025.\n\nStronger production capacity could give its top line a big boost\n\nOn its January earnings conference call, Supermicro CEO Charles Liang pointed out that the company is adding new production facilities and warehouses near its headquarters in San Jose, California, which should be up and running in \"a few months.\" The CEO also added that its new facility in Malaysia will help it support an annual revenue capacity that tops $25 billion.\n\nThe Malaysian facility is expected to start production in the second half of Supermicro's current fiscal year, which will put it in a position to smash past analysts' expectations in the next fiscal year. The company can do that as its server rack solutions are in strong demand for deploying powerful AI chips from the likes of Nvidia.\n\nMore specifically, the company got more than half of its revenue from selling AI-related server solutions in the previous quarter. Supermicro management also provided a hint that AI will continue to be a key growth driver, pointing out on the earnings call that \"next-generation AI and CPU platforms continue to drive strong levels of design wins, orders and backlog.\"\n\nIt is also worth noting that Supermicro is working to significantly enhance its production capacity of liquid-cooled servers by June this year. The company seems to be doing the right thing by making this move as Nvidia's upcoming AI graphics cards will reportedly consume 40% more power as compared to the previous generation offerings. This could create a strong demand for liquid-cooled servers and help Supermicro fill out its enhanced production capacity.\n\nAll this indicates that Supermicro stock's red-hot momentum is here to stay. Considering its shares aren't all that expensive right now, investors looking to buy an AI stock would do well to buy Supermicro right away as it seems set to breach the $2,000 mark over the next year or so.\n\nEven then, Supermicro stock seems to have room for more upside. The AI server market is expected to generate $177 billion in annual revenue in 2032 as compared to $38 billion last year, according to Global Market Insights, indicating that Super Micro Computer could be at the beginning of a multiyear growth curve.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Coinbase, Super Micro Computer and Herbalife",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 8, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coinbase COIN, Super Micro Computer SMCI and Herbalife HLF.\n\nReal-World vs. Theoretical Investing, part 2\n\nReal World Investors Look for Subtle Clues\n\nBelow are two of my most relied-upon clues:\n\nThe Reaction to the News Supersedes the News Itself: In late 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase. Rather than succumbing to poor news, the stock rallied back to where it was pre-lawsuit announcement within days. Investors should focus on the reaction to news instead of the news itself.\n\nRelative Strength:Relative strength is a simple but effective measure of a stock\u2019s potential. Simply put, investors should look for stocks showing unusual divergence versus the general market (this works especially well in down markets because RS names are easier to identify). For example, when equities hit multi-year lows in 2022, Super Micro Computer knocked on the door of 52-week highs. Ask yourself: \u201cIf the stock is hitting new highs in a brutal bear market, what will happen when the market pressure is alleviated?\u201d SMCI went on to multi-bag over the next few months and hasn\u2019t turned back since.\n\nSuccessful Trading is About Having an Edge Over a Series of Trades\n\nPeter Brandt\u2019s motto is:\u201cStrong opinions, weakly held.\u201d\n\nNew investors are typically unconcerned with the investing process and want to focus on finding a \u201chot\u201d stock pick. Successful trading is not about any given trade but rather about having an edge over a series of trades (like a casino).\n\nIn an interview a few years ago, billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones explained his risk/reward framework:\n\n\u201cFive to one means I\u2019m risking one dollar to make five. What five to one does is allow you to have a hit rate of 20%. I can actually be a complete imbecile. I can be wrong 80% of the time, and I\u2019m still not going to lose.\u201d\n\nLesson: Investors can be wrong more than right and still make a fortune on Wall Street. Shoot for outsized winners and small losers, and the math will work over time. Pay attention to the simple math behind successful trading!\n\nInterpret vs. Predict\n\nLast year, nearly every Wall Street analyst was wrong in their predictions. Real-world investors understand the importance of flexibility and focus on interpreting the current market action rather than making grandiose and bold predictions about the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket Direction is Paramount\n\nMost investors feel genius in a bull market and dumb in a bear market. The cold, hard truth is that about 75% of stocks follow the market direction. What separates profitable investors from unprofitable investors is their ability to recognize and take advantage of trend change. The 200-day moving average is a simple but effective tool for monitoring the intermediate to long-term market trend.\n\nKnow Your Timeframe\n\nAmateur investors often do not know their time frames. Without a framework, it\u2019s impossible to understand the trend of the stock you are trading. Worse, many investors argue on social media about a specific stock. The truth is that one investor can be long while another investor is short, and they can both be correct (due to differing time frames)! Knowing and sticking to your time frame is critical to success!\n\nBeing Right vs Making Money\n\nYears ago, two billionaire adversaries got into a public dispute on CNBC and took opposite sides of a trade. Bill Ackman shortedHerbalife,citing that it was a pyramid scheme and he would hold his short \u201cuntil the end of the Earth\u201d if necessary. Meanwhile, Carl Icahn bought tons of HLF shares and forced a short squeeze. Ackman ultimately threw in the towel and lost nearly $1 billion on the HLF trade after Icahn forced a classic short squeeze.\n\nRecently, Ackman took to X (formerly Twitter) to point out that his fundamental thesis about HLF after stock cratered recently was correct. Nonetheless, discussing whether you\u2019re right on a trade you lost money on is futile. Successful trades have three characteristics:\n\n1. Correct on direction.\n\n2. Correct on timing.\n\n3. Profitable\n\nAckman was correct on the fundamental thesis, yet he lost money. Correct trades are trades that are profitable, full stop. Never let your ego tell you otherwise.\n\nThe Best Investors Are Even Keel\n\nIn studying my and others' investing histories, the biggest portfolio drawdowns occur after large upside moves in equity curves. The best investors never get overly-emotional about wins or losses. Furthermore, if you find yourself celebrating like you just won the Superbowl, you\u2019re probably trading a position size that is far too large.\n\nBottom Line: Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication (Focus on the Intangibles)\n\nInstead of overcomplicating investing, savvy and profitable investors keep things as simple as possible. They understand liquidity (never fight the Fed), the general market trend (75% of stocks follow it), and are hyper-focused on risk and sound money management above all else. Remember, profitability is more important than academic history, prestigious awards, or sounding intelligent.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Stock Is Rising Again Today. Is It Still a Good Buy?",
        "content": "The momentum driving Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) sharp rise is continuing Wednesday. Supermicro shares rose as much as 7% in morning trading and were still about 4% higher by mid-afternoon. Those gains came in the wake of an earnings report from cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike that impressed Wall Street and strengthened the notion that demand for computing power is continuing to increase.\n\nThe stock has delivered a remarkable 300% jump year to date, and Supermicro and its insiders are taking advantage. Other investors may want to do the same.\n\nCapitalizing on the SMCI stock jump\n\nSupermicro stock has been moving higher for good reason. Its artificial intelligence (AI) server products are in high demand as AI technologies transform how businesses operate. Sales more than doubled year over year in the most recently reported quarter, and the company sees that growth continuing.\n\nMuch of the anticipated growth is already priced into the stock, though. Even its forward price-to-earnings ratio is over 50. So growth will have to exceed estimates for some time to bring the stock's valuation more into line with historical market levels.\n\nThat may help explain why the company -- and some of its executives -- are making moves to take advantage of the stock's rise. On Feb. 27, Supermicro announced it had raised about $1.7 billion from the sale of convertible senior notes. That was a smart move, as the company was able to find a buyer of the bonds at a zero interest rate.\n\nAnother company filing from last week showed that one company director sold some shares. Director Daniel Fairfax has now sold more than 1,200 shares over the last year. Over the past year, there have been 29 insider stock sales, but only four insider buys.\n\nInsiders sell shares for many reasons, including personal ones, so these moves shouldn't raise any alarms for investors. But given that its current share price already factors in a meaningful amount of hoped-for future growth, retail investors who have Supermicro shares in their portfolio should also think about taking profits by selling at least a portion of them.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

If you had invested $1,000 in the S&P 500 index on Jan. 1, 2019, your investment would have grown annually at 15% (with dividends reinvested) to $2,034.90 at the end of January 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 index has attained multiple record highs so far in 2024, yet there are still attractive investment opportunities available for the persistent investor. With artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a hot investment theme of the decade, investors can consider picking a small stake in Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nHere's why these stocks are smart buys now.\n\nPalantir\n\nShares of leading data mining software and machine learning specialist Palantir have gained nearly 50% since the company came out with a stellar fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 5. Revenue surged by 20% year over year to $608.4 million, driven mainly by the 32% year-over-year increase in the company's commercial business revenue. The company's government revenue, however, was up by only 11% year over year to $324 million.\n\nWhile the government business currently accounts for 53% of Palantir's total revenue, this revenue mix will soon change in favor of the commercial clients. Since the latter business involves higher pricing flexibility and lower regulatory burdens, this shift may help boost Palantir's margins. Palantir also reported its fifth consecutive quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability in the fourth quarter.\n\nPalantir attributes the rapid increase in new customers as well as expansion within existing customers mainly to the increasing adoption of the recently launched AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform).\n\nAIP, a generative artificial intelligence-powered software suite, helps integrate contextually relevant data across multiple sources such as video conferences, incident response calls, slack rooms, PDFs, images, video, and audio and then uses large language models and ontology to extract valuable insights from this unstructured data.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis helps enhance enterprise decision-making by including new data in an operationally relevant context. AIP has been instrumental in enabling the company to close 103 deals with annual recurring revenue of over $1 million in the fourth quarter. Hence, AIP is resulting in a significant expansion of the company's target addressable market.\n\nPalantir's Bootcamp-based go-to-market strategy with current and prospective customers has also played a pivotal role in driving the adoption of AIP. By demonstrating the value and capabilities of AIP in its Bootcamps, the company has successfully compressed the sales cycles and acquired new customers -- rapidly converting engagements into paying customers.\n\nHence, considering the company's solid financials, the rapid pace of commercial customer acquisition, and the increasing adoption of AIP, long-term investors can benefit dramatically in the coming years.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a provider of AI-optimized high-end servers and rack-scale total IT solutions -- including services, networking, security, storage, and software features -- all delivered as a single unit. While competitors focus on mass-produced, highly commoditized low and midrange servers, Supermicro (as it's commonly known) has differentiated itself by providing a \"building block\" or modular architecture.\n\nThis has enabled the company to offer highly customizable and scalable solutions to customers of different sizes, across industry verticals. The modular architecture also ensures that the company can quickly integrate new technologies into its solutions -- enabling it to launch these cutting-edge solutions in the market ahead of the competition.\n\nAs a result, Supermicro's high-performance solutions are now used by over 1,000 clients across more than 100 countries in areas such as enterprise, cloud, 5G telecommunications, edge IT infrastructure, AI, and the metaverse.\n\nSupermicro's longstanding partnership with Nvidia has also been a solid positive for the company. By gaining early access to cutting-edge H100 AI chips, the company has been very successful in capitalizing on the generative AI market's explosive growth.\n\nThe company is also investing to more than double the number of its AI offerings using upcoming chips such as Nvidia's H200 and B100 GPUs and Grace Hopper Superchip as well as Advanced Micro Devices'\u00a0MI300X/MI300A accelerators and Intel's Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 accelerators.\n\nSupermicro's AI-optimized servers and total IT rack-scale solutions are being used extensively for accelerated computing in data centers. The company's enterprise liquid-cooling technology is also being adopted rapidly by data centers to improve the performance, reliability, and efficiency of their power-intensive AI platforms.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024's second quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), the company earned over half of its revenue, or more than $1.8 billion, from the sale of AI servers and rack-scale total IT solutions. According to Global Market Insights, the AI server market is expected to grow from $38.3 billion in 2023 to $177.4 billion in 2032. Being the third-largest server player in the world with a 5% market share, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning demand in the AI server market.\n\nLastly, S&P Global just announced that Supermicro will join the benchmark S&P 500. This news propelled the stock higher, bringing its total gains in the past year to 934%. Yet, despite that stunning performance, the stock's valuation still makes fairly good sense. The shares are trading at about 8 times trailing-12-month sales, which is still within reason for a company expected to grow its revenue by 103% year over year in fiscal 2024 (ending June 30, 2024). Considering all these factors, Supermicro remains an excellent buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "If you bought Nvidia stock years ago and held on to it, you are likely to be significantly wealthier today. This semiconductor stock benefitted greatly from the interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and generated millionaire-making returns, helping the company grow to be worth $2.1 trillion. However, it will be hard for new Nvidia investors to get the same kinds of returns going forward because it is already so large. Investors looking for similar return production will need to dig deeper and find rising stars small enough to multiply in size over the coming years.\n\nTo aid in that search, here are five AI stocks with the potential to make millionaires over the coming decade and beyond:\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nData analytics company Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) builds custom software and AI applications on its Gotham, Apollo, and AIP platforms. The company has a deep relationship with the U.S. government and has been scooping up commercial customers. U.S. commercial bookings grew over 100% year over year in Q4. The company is profitable and has a whopping $3.6 billion in cash against zero debt to keep investing to grow. PLTR Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company's market cap is $55 billion, small enough that the stock has room to grow multiple times its current size if Palantir becomes the eventual mega-cap technology business investors hope. Palantir still has just 497 customers, leaving lots of room for more over the next decade and beyond.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nModular computer systems company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is growing its business grow at triple-digit rates thanks to the surge in demand for data center systems for AI. Supermicro's modular system is popular; management has pointed out that its growth far exceeds that of the broader industry. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang projects there will be a need for up to a trillion dollars of data center spending to accommodate the resource needs of AI. SMCI Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nConsidering Supermicro is still doing under $10 billion in annual sales, that's a considerable pie the company will be able to take a bite of. While the stock has already appreciated so much over the past year, the company is only now being added to the S&P 500 and is still worth just $50 billion today. That leaves room for long-term growth.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Symbotic\n\nRobotics company Symbotic(NASDAQ: SYM) is a game-changer in retail and e-commerce. The company is building proprietary fulfillment systems that efficiently store merchandise and use robotics to pick and fill orders. The company has only deployed 35 systems for nine customers, but mega-retailers like Walmart and Target are among them. The company is also developing fulfillment-as-a-service: rentable systems for third-party customers. SYM Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nHaving customers like Walmart (who rely on efficiency to keep prices low) shows confidence in the performance of these fulfillment systems. Symbotic is a young company but is already generating free cash flow. The company's $23 billion market cap leaves room for investment upside if Symbotic's systems become commonplace in the global economy.\n\n4. CrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity company CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) has emerged as a leader in next-generation technology, using AI to identify and address threats proactively. The company has expanded beyond endpoint security to grow its addressable market to $100 billion. As you can see below, CrowdStrike is still theoretically very early in its growth journey at less than $3 billion in annual sales. CRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nCybersecurity is fragmented and competitive, a mix of next-generation players and older, legacy companies from the industry's early years. CrowdStrike's impressive growth over the past few years signals that the business could continue taking market share, and investors are poised to benefit. It's the most prominent company on this list at $75 billion, but decades of growth could be ahead.\n\n5. UiPath\n\nSoftware automation is still relatively foreign to most companies, but UiPath(NYSE: PATH) could change that. The company's software can observe, learn, and replicate simple computer tasks like filling out forms and organizing data. It's a real-world scenario of automating humans out of simple jobs. Importantly, UiPath is the widely recognized industry leader, according to Gartner. PATH Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company already generates a lot of cash flow, and the stock market cap is only $13 billion. Automating office work could appeal to many companies worldwide, giving the stock potentially lucrative long-term return potential from its currently modest size.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Amid the recent favorable price action within the market, many stocks are nearing or breaking 52-week highs, including several highly recognizable names such as Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, Super Micro Computer SMCI, Coinbase COIN, and American Eagle Outfitters AEO.\n\nIn addition to recent momentum, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting upward earnings estimate revisions among analysts. Stocks making new highs tend to make even higher highs, particularly when positive earnings estimate revisions are present.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon shares have benefited nicely from an operational turnaround, with the company exceeding our consensus EPS expectations by an average of 50% across its last four releases. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings expectations moving higher across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon\u2019s growth profile is considerably bright, with current consensus expectations for its FY24 suggesting 40% earnings growth on 12% higher sales. Peeking ahead to FY25, estimates allude to an additional 30% of earnings growth paired with an 11% sales increase.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer shares have been unbelievably hot over the last year, gaining more than 1000% and reflecting one of the top performers overall. The bullish move has been driven by the AI frenzy, with expectations melting higher over the last several months and landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares are undoubtedly expensive when compared to historical levels, reflective of its current high-growth nature. The current forward 12-month earnings multiple presently sits at 40.7X, well above the 18.6X five-year median. Super Micro Computer is forecasted to witness 83% earnings growth on 100% higher sales in its current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms shares have also benefited in a big way from robust quarterly results, with META exceeding our consensus EPS estimates by an average of 20% across its last four releases. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with its earnings outlook notably bright. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIncome-focused investors seeking technology exposure could soon be interested \u2013 Meta unveiled its first-ever dividend following its latest print.\n\nCoinbase\n\nA renowned interest in crypto has had Coinbase shares hot, with analysts revising their expectations in a big way and pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company crushed our consensus EPS estimate by 1200% in its latest release. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings are forecasted to soar 170% on 30% higher revenues in its current fiscal year.\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters shares have been on a tear thanks to a better operating environment that has led to better-than-expected quarterly prints. The stock sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

        "title": "Seize the Surge: Why Investors Can\u2019t Ignore Small Caps, AI and Consumer Confidence Right Now",
        "content": "In a previous column, published on Feb. 28, I predicted that medium-cap and small-cap stocks would surge, powered by their \u201cfavorable fundamentals and low valuations.\u201d Last week, the latter process did indeed occur to a very large extent. Meanwhile, boding well for the tech sector. the artificial intelligence boom is spreading to many more stocks. And in a phenomenon that\u2019s lifting many consumer discretionary equities, investors\u2019 confidence in the economy appears to be rapidly improving. All in all, it does appear that investors are becoming much more optimistic, in line with the view that the well-known stock picker, Ken Fisher, has shared about the market\u2019s current status.\n\nFinally but importantly, it appears that the Federal Reserve remains open to cutting interest rates later this year. This is an important consideration for investors who invest in small-cap stocks.\n\nSmall-Cap and Medium-Cap Stocks Rallied\n\nThe Russell 2000, which is made up of small and medium names, jumped by an impressive total of nearly 3% last week. The huge increase shows that my thesis about those names is indeed playing out. The surge also indicates that many more investors, per my long-held thesis, are realizing that elevated interest rates do not constitute certain for the vast majority of small and medium companies. Indeed, even the most currently unprofitable firms with powerful competitive advantages can overcome high rates. That\u2019s because, as former FDIC head Sheila Bair has said, \u201cTruly promising innovations will (always) attract capital,\u201d even when interest rates are relatively high.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs more investors internalize the latter points, the demand for the shares of medium and small companies will surge, causing many of the bears who believed in the ill-fated \u201crates are everything for these companies\u201d thesis to cover their positions. Consequently, I continue to believe that a high proportion of these stocks will indeed undergo huge short-covering rallies in the medium-to-long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Tech Sector Is Getting Big Boosts\n\nMany investors are starting to realize that the positive AI boom will not be limited to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a few other chip makers.\n\nFurthering this revelation, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), previously seen as an unexciting tech \u201cdinosaur,\u201d delivered much better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on March 1. The firm\u2019s strong report was driven by \u201chigh demand for its artificial intelligence-optimized servers,\u201d Seeking Alpha explained. In the wake of Dell\u2019s strong numbers, its shares catapulted a huge 31.6% higher on March 1.\n\nFollowing Dell\u2019s results, other, old-time tech hardware makers rose meaningfully, with HP (NYSE:HPQ) advancing 3.8%, Hewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) climbing 3.5% (including after-hours action), and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) advancing 8%.\n\nAlso causing investors to look more positively on hardware makers was S&P Global\u2019s decision, announced after the market closed on March 1, to invite another server maker, Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI), to join the S&P 500. After jumping 4.5% during the regular session, SMCI stock climbed another 12.5% on the news of its accession to the index.\n\nFinally, Nvidia\u2019s investments in two startups that utilize AI in healthcare should boost the share prices of many other start-ups that are using AI in major fields. And NVDA\u2019s investment in SoundHoundAI (NASDAQ:SOUN), a relatively small company whose technology allows AI systems to more quickly respond to human voices, should increase investors\u2019 faith in small firms developing AI technology. This bodes well for small-cap stocks.\n\nConsumer Discretionary Names, the State of the Market, and the Fed\u2019s Outlook\n\nWith the labor market and consumer spending staying strong, fears of a recession are rapidly dissipating among investors while most consumer discretionary firms have been reporting strong quarterly results. The latter trends, in turn, are benefiting many stocks within the sector. As evidence of that assertion, consider that the Vanguard Discretionary ETF (NYSEARCA:VCR) rose nearly 10% between Jan 31 and March 1. As investors\u2019 attitudes about the economy continue to improve, consumer discretionary stocks should keep performing very well going forward.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock market as a whole keeps delivering outstanding returns. Over the month that ended in March, for example, the S&P 500 rose 3.6%, while the index advanced 11.8% in the three months that terminated on the same data. As a result, I continue to agree with Ken Fisher\u2019s recent assertion that we\u2019re in the early stages of the \u201coptimism\u201d part of John Templeton\u2019s famous description of the progression of bull markets. Specifically, Templeton said, \u201cBull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die of euphoria.\u201d\n\nFinally, the Fed looks poised to feed that optimism, as two Fed members, Tom Barkin and Austan Goolsbee, remained open to cutting rates later this year. Barkin said \u201cI\u2019m still hopeful inflation is going to come down and if inflation normalizes then it makes the case for why you want to normalize rates.\u201d\n\nGoolsbee was more optimistic, stating that inflation looks poised to fall further, while \u201crates are pretty restrictive\u201d already. Given these comments, it\u2019s clear that Goolsbee expects to support considerable rate cuts later this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in SMCI.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Is Falling Today",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock is slipping in Tuesday's trading. The server-technology specialist's share price was down 5.5% as of 12:15 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nWhile there isn't any business-specific news pulling Supermicro stock lower today, the company's share price is slipping as investors weigh risks in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. In particular, investors are feeling a bit more cautious about companies in the category after reports emerged today that Advanced Micro Devices will need to secure a special export license for some of its AI processors.\n\nThe red-hot AI stock takes a breather\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock has been on an incredible run, and it's not surprising to see investors pumping the breaks a bit. Yesterday, the server specialist's stock registered explosive gains and closed out the daily trading session up roughly 19% after it was announced that the company would become part of the S&P 500 index later this month. Today, investors have been left to weigh another ripple in the increasingly complex relationship between the U.S. and China -- and what it means for the rapidly evolving AI space.\n\nCompanies including AMD and Nvidia are currently blocked from selling their most advanced AI processors to China. In turn, AMD specifically tailored processors that can be sold in the Chinese market.\n\nNow, it looks like AMD and other advanced processor designers may have another hoop to jump through if they want to do business in the Middle Kingdom. In response, investors are taking a slightly more cautious approach to Supermicro and other high-profile AI stocks today.\n\nWhat do the politics of AI mean for Supermicro stock?\n\nAccess to advanced artificial intelligence technologies has emerged as a vital national security issue. It's also a central point driving rising tensions between the U.S. and China. The U.S. and other Western allies have made moves to limit China's access to advanced processors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's possible that these developments could limit Supermicro's growth potential in China and some other markets. The company uses Nvidia's processors in its high-performance rack servers, and there is a risk that new regulations could curb some of its business opportunities.\n\nOn the other hand, the company generates the large majority of its revenue from U.S.-based customers. Geopolitical relations between the U.S. and China present a broad-based risk for the stock market right now, but Supermicro's business actually looks fairly insulated at the moment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro to Join S&amp;P 500, Shares Rally: ETFs to Buy",
        "content": "One of the hottest trades - Super Micro Computer SMCI \u2013 is set to enter the S&P 500 Index on quarterly rebalance, replacing Whirlpool. The move came on the back of its historic rally as the stock soared more than twentyfold over the past two years and over 200% just since the start of 2024. Super Micro jumped 19% to a new all-time high following the news, propelling its market cap to $60 billion (read: Time to Buy Super Micro (SMCI) Heavy ETFs as It Joins S&P 500?).\r\n\r\nSuper Micro\u2019s inclusion in the S&P 500 is good news for its shareholders as well as the stock. It will attract new investors to the company, who would indirectly purchase the company through financial products invested in the S&P 500. Given this, investors could tap the opportune moment with the help of the ETFs having a substantial allocation to this server maker. These include iShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF IDGT, Invesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF XMMO, and Invesco S&P MidCap 400 Pure Growth ETF RFG.\n\nSolid Growth Prospects\n\nThe addition in the S&P 500 will fuel substantial growth in the Super Micro as money managers are on the hunt for other companies that are capitalizing on the AI boom after bellwether Nvidia's NVDA stunning rally, which made it the third most valuable U.S. company (read: Nvidia Drives AI and Semiconductor Stocks: ETFs to Gain).\r\n\r\nSuper Micro's success can be largely attributed to the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom within the technology sector. As a leading provider of servers and computer infrastructure essential for AI developments, Super Micro has become a key player in supporting the deployment and training of AI models, especially those based on Nvidia technology.\r\n\r\nThe stock also got a boost from its robust earnings reported in late January. Super Micro has demonstrated impressive performance, with its revenue doubling to $3.66 billion in the quarter ended December. Market analysts project that the company's sales will more than triple in the current quarter. Such optimistic forecasts are bolstered by Super Micro's strategic partnerships and its ability to tailor server solutions to meet the specific needs of its customers, further establishing its prominence in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts are Bullish\n\nWall Street is bullish on the stock. Super Micro currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by nine brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.86 a month ago based on seven recommendations.\r\n\r\nOf the nine recommendations deriving the current ABR, six are Strong Buy, representing 66.67% of all recommendations.\r\n\r\nBased on short-term price targets offered by eight analysts, the average price target for Super Micro Computer comes to $717.38. The forecasts range from a low of $250.00 to a high of $1,300.00.\n\nSolid Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuper Micro saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past month for the fiscal year (ending June 2024), with an estimated earnings growth of 83.8%. This compares favorably with the industry\u2019s growth projection of 14.29%.\r\n\r\nSMCI has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 6%), suggesting good tidings for the stock.\n\nETFs to Buy\n\niShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF (IDGT)\r\n\r\niShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF offers exposure to U.S.-listed companies involved in the storage, processing, transmission and/or access of digital data and services. It follows the S&P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index and holds 28 stocks in its basket, with Super Micro occupying the top position at 11.5% share.\r\n\r\niShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF has accumulated $46 million in its asset base and charges 41 bps in annual fees. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #1.\r\n\r\nInvesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF (XMMO)\r\n\r\nInvesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF offers exposure to mid-cap firms having the highest momentum scores by tracking the S&P Midcap 400 Momentum Index. It holds 74 stocks in its basket, with Super Micro taking the top spot at 10.6%. XMMO has key holdings in industrials, consumer discretionary, information technology and financials (read: 5 Top-Ranked ETFs at New Highs Set to Soar Further).\r\n\r\nInvesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF has AUM of $1.6 billion and charges 34 bps in annual fees. It trades in an average daily volume of 184,000 shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nInvesco S&P MidCap 400 Pure Growth ETF (RFG)\r\n\r\nInvesco S&P MidCap 400 Pure Growth ETF follows the S&P MidCap 400 Pure Growth Index, which measures the performance of securities that exhibit strong growth characteristics in the S&P MidCap 400 Index.

        "title": "Here's Why We Think Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) Is Well Worth Watching",
        "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nView our latest analysis for Super Micro Computer\n\nHow Fast Is Super Micro Computer Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nSuper Micro Computer has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Super Micro Computer's EPS has risen over the last 12 months, growing from US$11.06 to US$13.09. There's little doubt shareholders would be happy with that 18% gain.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for Super Micro Computer remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 39% to US$9.3b. That's progress.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this freeinteractive visualization of Super Micro Computer's forecast profits?\n\nStory continues\n\nAre Super Micro Computer Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Super Micro Computer has a market capitalisation of US$60b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$9.0b. Coming in at 15% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.\n\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Super Micro Computer, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.\n\nThe CEO of Super Micro Computer was paid just US$1.0 in total compensation for the year ending June 2023. This could be considered a token amount, and indicates that the company does not need to use payment to motivate the CEO - that is often a good sign. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\n\nShould You Add Super Micro Computer To Your Watchlist?\n\nOne important encouraging feature of Super Micro Computer is that it is growing profits. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Super Micro Computer, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. It is worth noting though that we have found 4 warning signs for Super Micro Computer (2 are potentially serious!) that you need to take into consideration.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were climbing again today even though there was no company-specific news on the artificial intelligence (AI) stock juggernaut. However, AI stocks have a tendency to move in unison, and good news from fellow traveler Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) seemed to lift Nvidia stock as well.\n\nSuper Micro shares jumped after the S&P Global said that the maker of servers and storage equipment that are especially valued for AI applications would join the S&P 500 on March 18. The news acts as a broader stamp of approval for Super Micro and the rest of the AI sector and seemed to spark a new round of euphoria as investors piled into these stocks again.\n\nNvidia closed at 3.6% after trading up as high as 6.6% earlier in the session, while Super Micro Computer had gained 25.3%. Among the other winners in the AI space were Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which both finished up more than 3%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA rising AI tide lifts all boats\n\nAfter having a banner year in 2023, Nvidia has gotten out to a breakneck start in 2024 as the stock is now up roughly 75% year to date.\n\nNvidia's own strong fourth-quarter results have helped drive those gains, but it's also surged nearly every time there's been good news out on a peer. For example, last Friday the stock gained when Dell Technologies said it was seeing surging demand for AI servers, and earlier in February, it rose on strong quarterly results from Arm Holdings, a close partner in chip design.\n\nBoth Super Micro and Nvidia are experiencing massive revenue growth from AI-related demand, and they have been two of the biggest winners from the AI boom. Therefore, it's not surprising to see Nvidia responding to good news for Super Micro.\n\nWhat's next for Nvidia\n\nUpdates from companies in recent weeks have shown that the AI boom is only picking up steam as cloud-computing companies and others build out their AI infrastructure and products like Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) remain in high demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nLater this week, we'll get an update from Broadcom, known for its strength in networking chips which are expected to play a role in AI, and next week Arm Holdings' initial public offering (IPO) lock-up period will expire, which could lead to volatility in that stock.\n\nEither of those events could move Nvidia stock as well. Expect Nvidia to continue to be volatile on broader AI news, though the surge in demand for AI products makes the stock more likely to go up than down.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Momentum is carrying the market and positive thinking is carrying the market.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 97.55 points, or 0.25%, to 38,989.83, the S&P 500 lost 6.13 points, or 0.12%, to 5,130.95 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 67.43 points, or 0.41%, to 16,207.51.\n\nThe S&P 500's communications services index was the benchmark's weakest sector, ending down 1.5%, while defensive utilities, which added 1.6%, was its biggest gainer for the day.\n\nThe Nasdaq had kicked off March by hitting an intraday record high on Friday, also closing at its highest level for two straight days, as the artificial intelligence-driven tech rally continues to steal the spotlight on Wall Street.\n\nThe S&P 500 has also been on a winning streak recently, jumping over 21% with four straight months of gains through February. BofA Global Research lifted its year-end target for the benchmark index to 5,400, from 5,000, representing a 5% upside from current levels.\n\nAlong with economic data, investors are also waiting for comments from Fed chair Powell, who is due to testify before lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nAI server maker Super Micro Computer finished up 18.6% and shoe maker Deckers Outdoor rose 2.6% ahead of their inclusion in the S&P 500 index.\n\nShares in Macy's jumped 13.5% after real-estate-focused investing firm Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management raised their offer for the department store chain.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 106 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 194 new highs and 99 new lows.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges 12.69 billion shares changed hands, ahead of the 11.87 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.\n\n(Reporting by Sin\u00e9ad Carew in New York, Ankika Biswas and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Aurora Ellis)",

        "content": "Super Micro Computer SMCI saw a 12.7% surge in its shares during after-hours trading on Mar 1, 2024 just after the announcement that the provider of AI-optimized servers would be included in the S&P 500 index.\n\nThe news puts focus on Super Micro-heavy ETFs like Invesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF XMMO (SMCI\u2019s exposure is 10.22%), iShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF IDGT (SMCI\u2019s exposure is 9.91%), Pacer Lunt MidCap Multi-Factor Alternator ETF PAMC (SMCI\u2019s exposure is 8.22%) and Amplify Global Cloud Technology ETF IVES (SMCI\u2019s exposure is 7.56%).\n\nThis decision, disclosed by S&P Dow Jones Indices, is part of the quarterly rebalance scheduled to take effect before the market opens on Monday, March 18. Super Micro and Deckers Outdoor Corp DECK will replace Whirlpool Corp and Zion Bancorporation in the index.\n\nThe addition of Super Micro and Deckers to the S&P 500 index will necessitate purchases of their shares by index funds that mirror the composition of the benchmark, which collectively manage approximately $7.8 trillion in assets, as reported by Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, per Reuters.\n\nWhy to Buy Super Micro-Heavy ETFs?\n\nSuper Micro's remarkable performance stems from its sales of high-end servers incorporating Nvidia's cutting-edge AI processors, contributing to its stock more than tripling in value this year. The stock has jumped 217.2% this year (as of Mar 1, 2024). With the company's market capitalization surpassing $50 billion, market watchers started speculating its inclusion in the S&P 500.\n\nFriday saw substantial trading activity in Super Micro's shares, with nearly $10 billion worth exchanged, surpassing trading volumes of industry giants like Microsoft and Amazon. This after-hours surge complements the 4.5% increase observed during Friday's regular trading session.\n\nMagnitude - Consensus Estimate Trend\n\nIts earnings estimate for the upcoming quarter rose to $5.64 from $5.62 in the past seven days. Earnings growth for the March quarter is expected to be 246% over 204% revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Target\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by eight analysts, the average price target for Super Micro Computer comes to $717.38. The forecasts range from a low of $250.00 to a high of $1,300.00. The average price target represents a decline of 17.17% from the last closing price of $866.12.\n\nBroker Rating\n\nSuper Micro Computer currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by nine brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.86 a month ago based on seven recommendations. Of the nine recommendations deriving the current ABR, six are Strong Buy, representing 66.67% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy represented 71.43%.\n\nAre ETFs Better Bets?\n\nWhile Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) SMCI has more room to run, the stock lacks on value. Its value score is downbeat at \u201cF\u201d and growth score is also low at \u201cD.\u201d The stock has a moderate momentum score of \u201cC.\u201d Hence, the basket approach gives better protection against any kind of downside as the ETF lessens the company-specific risks.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. could soon be dethroned as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 by another artificial intelligence-linked firm with staggering returns in the past year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Rules Trump Can Appear on Presidential Ballots Wall Street\u2019s DEI Retreat Has Officially Begun China Scraps Premier Li's Briefing, Breaking Years of Convention America Blew Almost $2 Trillion. Make It Stop. What to Remember If the Stock Market Takes a Dive\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer Inc. are up as much as 28% in intraday trading Monday and on track to close at an all-time high following news that the company is set to be added to the S&P 500 Index later this month. The move extended gains for the server and software provider to more than 1,000% in the past twelve months, dwarfing Nvidia\u2019s nearly 260% rally during the same period.\n\nThe gain this year alone has added about $48 billion to Super Micro\u2019s market capitalization, pushing its total value to nearly $64 billion.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense for it to be included in the S&P,\u201d said Shana Sissel, CEO at Banrion Capital Management LLC. \u201cIt could actually drive the S&P higher, because now you have a name other than Nvidia that will be driving returns.\u201d\n\nSuper Micro\u2019s addition to the S&P 500 Index means that the benchmark will have even more AI representation outside of the top technology companies that have lead the broader market higher this year. Deckers Outdoor Corp. will also be added to the index, replacing Whirlpool Corp. and Zions Bancorp.\n\nThe San Jose, California-based company\u2019s surge received an additional boost in January when it reported preliminary results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and signaled strong demand for AI.\n\n\u201cIn just over a year, its stock price soared from around $102 to over $1,000, attributed to increased demand for AI\u2014related products and positive growth forecasts,\u201d Rosenblatt Securities Inc. analyst Hans Mosesmann wrote in a note dated March 4. Mosesmann has a buy rating and the Street-high price target of $1,300 for shares of Super Micro.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be sure, the stock has experienced some volatility in recent weeks. At the end of February, short sellers betting on declines in the stock notched paper gains of $1.2 billion when shares tumbled 20% in one day. Since then, the shares have traded even higher, putting year-to-date paper losses for the group at more than $3.2 billion, according to data from S3 Partners LLC.\n\nRead more: Super Micro Short Sellers Notch $1.2 Billion as Shares Fall (1)\n\nAnd, while stocks generally leap on the news that they\u2019ll be joining the S&P 500 Index, gains are usually muted once they\u2019re added, Sissel said.\n\n\u201cFor people who think this means that all of a sudden this pushes Super Micro Computer up even more, I\u2019d temper that,\u201d she said. \u201cFollowing the completion of the inclusion, you usually see the stock sell off a little bit.\u201d\n\nStill, Wall Street is overall bullish on the company. Super Micro has 11 buy ratings, four holds and only one sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The current average price target of $819 implies a roughly 28% downside for shares, but analyst targets often lag rallies like the one that Super Micro has seen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Private Equity\u2019s Green Star Started It All With a Database The Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation Into Monaco\u2019s Royal Family\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "After more than tripling just so far in 2024, the rally in shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) continued Monday. Supermicro, as it's known, will be added to the S&P 500 index before the opening of trading on March 18.\n\nThat's just the latest catalyst for the stock of the maker of servers for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And it shouldn't be unexpected since the stock's market cap has now soared to about $60 billion. What investors need to know now is whether the company is worth that valuation and whether the stock's meteoric rise will continue.\n\nRiding the AI boom\n\nSupermicro's rally comes as investors continue to see more and more companies reporting massive sales growth for AI-related equipment. Nvidia is perhaps the most well-known beneficiary of the AI boom, but even Dell Technologies' shares surged more than 30% last week after it reported robust demand for its AI servers. Supermicro shares have been riding that same AI demand wave.\n\nBut Supermicro's valuation only makes sense if its sales and profits are set to continue soaring higher. As demand for computing power for AI applications grows, sales of Supermicro's server solutions should also grow. In fact, sales soared by more than 70% over the last two sequential quarterly periods. The company sees its net sales continuing to increase in the current quarter, though not as quickly.\n\nBut it's not just about sales. And profits aren't going to grow as fast as they have for Nvidia. Supermicro's gross profit margin averaged just 16% over the last six months. By comparison, Nvidia's is nearly 5 times that.\n\nThe frenzy to own anything AI has driven Supermicro stock to such lofty heights more than the business itself. At some point investors are likely to take profits and reprice Supermicro stock lower.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

Apple fell 2.6% following a $2-billion EU antitrust fine for preventing Spotify and other music streaming services from informing users of payment options outside its App Store.\n\nOutperforming peers, Nvidia jumped 3.5% after its market value closed above $2 trillion for the first time on Friday.\n\nThe Nasdaq kicked off March by hitting an intraday all-time high on Friday, also closing at its highest level for the second day, as the artificial intelligence-driven tech rally continues to steal the spotlight on Wall Street.\n\nThe S&P 500 has also been on a record-breaking rally, jumping over 21% in four straight months of gains through February.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Blasted Higher on Monday Morning",
        "content": "Shares of server and storage-solution specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, resumed their relentless rise Monday, surging as much as 21.1%. As of 10:43 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 18.4%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the artificial intelligence (AI) stock higher was an announcement it would be joining a major trading index.\n\nJoining the S&P 500\n\nAn announcement released after market close on Friday revealed that Supermicro would be joining the S&P 500. The stock will be replacing home appliance specialist Whirlpool when the market opens on March 18. In a press release marking the occasion, S&P Global noted, \"the changes ensure that each index is more representative of its market capitalization rage.\"\n\nTo be eligible to join the S&P 500, a company must be based in the U.S. and have a market cap of at least $8.2 billion. Additionally, at least 50% of its shares must be publicly traded, and the company must have been profitable in each of the previous four quarters.\n\nStocks often rally when they're added to the benchmark index because funds and institutional investors that track the major indexes must buy shares to duplicate their holdings. However, the rally usually subsides once the benchmark-related buying is done.\n\nReason to buy the stock?\n\nJust because a stock is joining a particular index is no reason to buy the stock. Rather, investors should look to the company's underlying operating and financial results to determine whether it's worth owning.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro produced net sales that soared 103% year over year to $3.66 billion. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that surged 71% to $5.59. Management was clear that the record revenue was the result of strong demand for rack-scale servers used for AI. These impressive results were likely the catalyst that prompted its inclusion in the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also factor in the valuation of a company when making their buying decisions. Supermicro is currently selling for just 2x forward sales, which is the standard for an undervalued stock. This suggests that despite the stock's 1,000% rise over the past year, there's still additional upside ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Shares of Zions Bancorporation ZION lost 2.2% in the after-market trading on Friday after it came to light that the bank will lose its spot in the S&P 500 Index.\r\n\r\nThe S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI and Deckers Outdoor Corporation DECK will join the S&P 500 Index, replacing ZION and Whirlpool Corporation WHR, effective Mar 18.\r\n\r\nZION and WHR will be joining the S&P Midcap 400 Index.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro is a maker of high-end servers that are used in artificial intelligence applications, whereas Deckers is a footwear manufacturer.\r\n\r\nAfter an almost 240% rally in 2023, shares of SMCI have gained more than 200% so far this year as the ecstasy for disruptive technologies has fueled the demand for its servers. Also, the Deckers Outdoor stock has rallied more than 35% this year.\r\n\r\nWith the inclusion of SMCI and DECK in the S&P 500 Index, more importance will be given to the technology and consumer discretionary sectors, with less weight given to the industrial and financial sectors.\r\n\r\nNotably, the S&P 500 Index is a market-cap-weighted index, which means that with bigger market capitalization, a company will have more influence on the index.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Super Micro\u2019s market cap is approximately $51 billion, which is much above the combined market caps of Whirlpool and ZION.\r\n\r\nThe S&P Dow Jones Indices stated, \u201cThe changes ensure each index is more representative of its market capitalization range. All companies being added to the S&P 500 are more representative of the large-cap market space, while all companies being added to the S&P MidCap 400 are more representative of the mid-cap market space.\u201d\r\n\r\nLooking at ZION, the company, like most of its regional banking peers, has been suffering because of its sizeable exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) loans. As of Dec 31, 2023, ZION\u2019s exposure to commercial loans was 76.1%.\r\n\r\nAnd, since the demand for such loans is gradually waning amid a challenging operating backdrop, the asset quality of these loan categories will likely deteriorate in case of an economic slowdown. This is expected to hurt ZION\u2019s profitability.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, shares of ZION lost 10.8%. The stock has declined 11.6% so far in 2024.\r\n\r\nAmid the rapidly increasing interest rate environment, defaults on CRE loans climbed to 14-year highs last year. Weakness in the CRE lending industry has added to the woes of regional banks like ZION (as these have relatively more exposure to bad loans than their bigger rivals), which have already been struggling with unrealized losses.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that following the regional bank failures, Zions\u2019 long-term issuer rating has been lowered to Baa2 from Baa1 by Moody\u2019s as high level of unrealized losses in available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios, and a relatively low level of capitalization pose major headwinds.\r\n\r\nOver the past six months, ZION shares have gained 7.3% compared with the industry\u2019s 9.7% growth.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, ZION carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 4, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights BigBear.ai BBAI, Palantir PLTR, Super Micro Computer SMCI, SoundHound AI SOUN and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nWhat Are Some of the Lesser-Known A.I. Plays?\n\nBy now, the AI revolution is no secret to Wall Street. However, two under-the-radar, pure play AI stocks offer asymmetric reward-to-risk. In addition, these two up-and-comers have recently inked deals with AI juggernauts, offering a massive catalyst. Below are the two highest-impact AI partnerships:\n\nBigBear.ai & Palantir\n\nBigBear.ai and Palantir both offer decision intelligence solutions spanning national security, digital identity, supply chains and logistics, enterprise operations, and integration of manned-unmanned teaming within autonomous systems. On February 28th, BBAI and PLTR announced a strategic partnership combining AI-powered products with a next-generation operating platform. The partnership is a big deal for BBAI for two reasons:\n\n1.) BBAI has a market cap of just $600 million, while PLTR has a market cap of $54 billion. With PLTR as a partner, BBAI has an opportunity to throw gasoline on their growth.\n\n2.) PLTR is the undisputed leader in this niche space. If PLTR finds value in BBAI\u2019s offering, it proves the quality of BBAI\u2019s product suite. Also, PLTR may look to acquire the company down the line, should it be necessary.\n\nSwing to Profitably\n\nNvidia and Super Micro Computer have proven how much demand there is for the AI industry. However, few pure plays exist, and even fewer profitable ones. Last quarter, BBAI posted its first profitable quarter as a public company.\n\nWall Street is Bullish\n\nZacks Consensus Estimates suggest healthy EPS growth of 64.21% in 20223.\n\nBBAI is also gaining momentum from an EPS expectations perspective. Last quarter, BBAI beat analysts\u2019 expectations by 142.86%.\n\nAccumulation Patterns\n\nOn February 27, shares jumped 38% on volume 10x the norm! The news was not apparent, but such heavy volume and price momentum indicate massive accumulation. The stock also forms a bullish and potentially explosive high-tight flag pattern.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound AI & Nvidia\n\nSOUN Overview\n\nSoundHound is a technology company that specializes in audio and voice recognition. One of its prominent products is the SoundHound app, which allows users to identify songs by listening to a snippet of music. Users can hum, sing, or type lyrics into the app, and it provides information about the song title, artist, and album. SOUN\u2019s technology extends beyond music identification, incorporating voice-enabled AI solutions for various applications, including voice-controlled virtual assistants and integration into smart devices.\n\nWhy is the NVDA Investment Impactful?\n\nUntil now, NVDA has been selling the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d to the AI revolution. However, NVDA\u2019s first 13F filing shows the company stepped out of its wheelhouse to purchase nearly $4 million worth of SOUN, showing the company also has ambitions for AI pure plays. Also, now that NVDA has the third largest market cap in the U.S., the company has plenty of cash to add exposure to their investment down the line \u2013 likely to keep a bid under SOUN shares.\n\nBullish EPS Surprise History\n\nThough SOUN has only been public since early 2022, the company has exhibited a strong tendency to beat Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations. SOUN has bested Zacks EPS Estimates in six of its first eight quarters.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 4, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Russell 2000 Index ETF IWM and Super Micro Computer SMCI.\n\nSmall but Mighty: Is the Russell 2000 Signaling a Comeback?\n\nSmall Caps and the Russell 2000 Index ETF have lagged behind their large-cap counterparts for years. However, signs are emerging that that is likely to change. Below are the reasons why:\n\nInflation & Interest Rate Concerns are Subsiding\n\nDue to their inherent characteristics, small-cap stocks are often more sensitive to inflation and interest rates. Smaller companies usually have limited resources, making them more vulnerable to rising operating costs during inflationary periods. Additionally, these firms face challenges adjusting product prices quickly to offset inflationary pressures.\n\nWhen inflation increases, the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to deal with it. Rising interest rates can adversely impact small caps as borrowing costs increase, squeezing their profit margins and making it more challenging for them to access capital. The combination of increased operating costs, perceived risk, and higher borrowing expenses has weighed on small caps over the past few years, but that appears to be changing.\n\nYesterday morning, Core PCE (the U.S. Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation) decreased to 2.8% in January, the lowest inflation rate since March 2021. Markets are now pricing in three interest rate cuts in 2024. A lower Fed Funds Rate is a bullish catalyst for small-cap stocks.\n\nEarnings are Turning the Corner\n\nUntil the back half of 2023, the Russell 2000\u2019s earnings growth declined for four straight quarters. However, in Q3 and Q4 2024, they rebounded strongly, and Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimates suggest that the positive momentum will continue. The Russell\u2019s year-over-year earnings are expected to grow a healthy 10% in 2024 and a robust 41% in 2025! Remember, markets tend to discount future earnings growth in advance.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Action\n\nMulti-time frame analysis\n\nMutti-timeframe analysis is an investment approach technicians use to simultaneously examine an asset across different time intervals. The idea behind MTFA is that the more timeframes you combine, the more well-rounded the technical assessment of an asset\u2019s price action is and the higher the odds the trade works. Below is a daily and weekly comparison of the Russell 2000 Index ETF as an example. The index also threatens to break out on the quarterly and yearly timeframes \u2013 a bullish sign.\n\nChange of Character\n\nThe 10-week moving average is the best proxy for the intermediate trend in stocks and ETFs. Unlike 2023, IWM is finding buying support at its 10-week moving average.\n\nThe Longer the Base, The Higher in Space?\n\nSuper Micro Computer and several other stocks proved that long base breakouts produce some of the most robust uptrends. IWM is attempting to break out of a base structure that dates all the way back to April 2022.\n\nCash Rich\n\nDespite the tumultuous performance over the past few years, small caps are cash-rich.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Jumped 64% in February",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) was a big winner last month. The maker of storage and server systems that are highly valued for artificial-intelligence applications continued to climb after reporting a blowout earnings report late January and benefited from strong quarterly results from Nvidia, a key supplier. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock gained 63% in February.\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro has emerged as something of a bellwether in the AI stock sector, and the stock has been highly volatile, swinging in response to broader sentiment on AI stocks. SMCI Chart\n\nThe AI boom is still heating up\n\nIt's unusual to see a stock soar this much in a single month without any major company-specific news, but Supermicro's gains show how much it's benefiting from excitement over AI.\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro is seeing its revenue growth soar. Sales were up 103% in its quarterly report, released at the end of January, and investors see it as a big winner in the AI boom.\n\nIn addition to momentum from that earnings report, the stock benefited from a bullish note from Goldman Sachs on Nvidia, citing robust demand for AI servers. That pushed Supermicro stock up 14% on Feb. 5. At the end of that week, on Feb. 9, the stock jumped after Arm Holdings delivered a blowout earnings report, citing rising AI demand.\n\nFinally, the stock briefly topped $1,000 a share the following week, on Feb. 15, after Bank of America initiated coverage with a buy rating, saying the market for AI servers is much larger than Wall Street believes.\n\nHowever, the following day, the stock came crashing down after Wells Fargo rated the stock \"equal weight\" and said the high expectations were largely priced in.\n\nFollowing a brief swoon, the stock skyrocketed on Feb. 22, after Nvidia delivered another blowout earnings report. Then it cooled off for the rest of the month. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWill Supermicro keep gaining?\n\nSupermicro started off March with a bang, jumping 4.5% on March 1, after rival Dell Technologies said it was seeing demand for AI servers jump. After hours on Friday, Supermicro shares soared again when the company gained admission into the S&P 500, a key milestone that acts as a stamp of approval from the broad market index. Its inclusion means that ETFs that track the S&P 500 will have to buy the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro shares have already tripled this year, but those gains seem warranted, given its strong performance and soaring demand for AI hardware. The stock is likely to remain volatile, given the hype in the AI sector, but it still looks like a good bet to move higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Be the Next Nvidia",
        "content": "Finding the next great stock, like an Amazon or, more recently, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), is the dream -- one stock that can generate portfolio- and life-changing returns, sometimes very quickly. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has given investors its best Nvidia impression. The stock is up a whopping 750% over the past year.\n\nNow, a stock rarely goes up that much, that quickly. That's why it might seem wild that I'm predicting it will continue. Of course, success may not be a straight line. Still, I believe Supermicro, as it is better known these days, could easily mimic Nvidia's epic multiyear run and soar upward over the coming years.\n\nSupermicro is becoming the market leader in its field\n\nThe recipe for Supermicro's success is simple. Dominant leadership in a rapidly growing industry equals outperformance. Investors are already seeing the equation play out, which helps explain the stock's remarkable success. My prediction is based on the simple theory that artificial intelligence (AI) spending will continue well into the future.\n\nFirst, the basics. Supermicro is a computing hardware innovator. It began with motherboards in the early 1990s but today sells turn-key modular server systems to corporations. Do you know how to build a computer from scratch? Neither do many companies. So, like most would do, they turn to an expert like Supermicro.\n\nSupermicro's modular system can be easily scaled to the size a company needs and can be built upon in the future if needs grow. Like Nvidia's AI chips, customers are flocking to Supermicro for their AI needs: Image source: Super Micro Computer.\n\nManagement is basing this on its internal data and industry data from Gartner. Supermicro's revenue grew 103% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), and guidance is for up to 218% year-over-year growth in the current quarter.\n\nA rapidly growing industry\n\nThe million-dollar question, of course, is whether this can last. According to the people most connected to AI, it can and will. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently made headlines for his call to expand global chip capacity, claiming a need to invest trillions of dollars for the cause. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted an additional $1 trillion in data center spending over the next several years.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf these predictions are remotely accurate, Supermicro, which just did $3.7 billion in revenue in Q2, is poised to have more opportunities than it can shake a stick at. Ultimately, this has to play out, and an inability to support demand could send business to Supermicro's competitors. However, it's hard to see how Super Micro Computer doesn't have every opportunity to fulfill these skyrocketing expectations for long-term growth.\n\nA surprisingly reasonable valuation\n\nGiven the abovementioned situation, it's reasonable to expect growth estimates to rise. That's happened already. Analysts are looking for earnings growth averaging 48% annually over the long term. This seems realistic for a company now growing at a triple-digit rate.\n\nAt a forward P/E ratio of just 40, Supermicro's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is less than 1, signaling that the stock is still a bargain for its expected future growth potential. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThere's a fascinating psychological phenomenon called anchoring bias, in which the mind sticks to the first number it sees. In other words, investors see how much Supermicro has climbed over the past year and assume that the stock must be expensive. To be fair, most stocks are overpriced if they rise that much in a year.\n\nHowever, data shows that Supermicro could be the exception. Now, there are investment risks because you are projecting things in the future. Nothing is guaranteed in life. However, the data and recent financial performance indicate a bright future for Super Micro Computer and its shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock to Buy Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Let's cut to the chase: The ability of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to automate certain tasks and increase productivity has captured the attention of businesses everywhere. Generative AI can draft original documents, summarize existing data, create presentations, and even write and debug computer code -- and new use cases are being discovered regularly.\n\nCathie Wood, the enigmatic founder of Ark Investment Management, has long focused on disruptive innovation, and her view on the potential of generative AI is eye-opening. \"AI is going to enable the most massive productivity increase in our history,\" she said. \"The productivity gains are going to be astounding and shocking.\"\n\nOne company at the heart of this secular tailwind is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro. The stock has ridden the wave of AI higher over the past year, but there could be much more to come. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nServers of the stars\n\nWhile it may not be a household name, Supermicro has burst on the scene over the past year or so as one of the leading providers of servers used in enterprise data centers, cloud computing, and AI systems. The company offers a broad selection of servers and storage systems, from full plug-and-play systems to modular components. Supermicro also provides a helping hand to customers to install and upgrade their computing infrastructure.\n\nThe company has been developing cutting-edge server and storage systems for more than three decades. So when the opportunity represented by generative AI came knocking, Supermicro was there to answer the call.\n\nSupermicro works closely with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others, to ensure its servers have a steady supply of -- and work seamlessly with -- the latest and greatest AI-centric processors.\n\nA vast and growing opportunity\n\nWhile AI has been around for decades, generative AI is the next giant leap forward in the technology. The previously mentioned potential to vastly increase productivity sets the technology apart from its predecessors. Businesses are also looking to gain an edge, and the ability to save time and money has companies of all types looking to get a slice of the pie.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile estimates are a dime a dozen, no one can offer a definitive value of the size of the market. Generative AI could represent a $1.3 trillion market by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. A more bullish take can be found in Ark Invest's Big Ideas 2024 report, where Cathie Wood suggests that the AI software market alone could generate incremental spending of $13 trillion by the end of the decade. While the size of the market is still elusive, one thing is clear: The opportunity is sizable.\n\nBlockbuster results\n\nSupermicro's results help illustrate the opportunity. For the company's fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro generated net sales of $3.66 billion, which soared 103% year over year and 73% sequentially. At the same time, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.59 represented a 71% surge. The company noted its record growth was driven by demand for rack-scale systems used for AI.\n\nManagement expects the company's growth spurt to continue. Supermicro is forecasting third-quarter revenue in a range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, representing 205% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of its guidance. Profit is also expected to surge, with adjusted EPS of roughly $5.61, up 244%. The company also raised its full fiscal-year revenue guidance to a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion, an increase of at least 100%.\n\nCEO Charles Liang addressed the ongoing demand, noting, \"Overall, I feel very confident that this AI boom will continue for another many quarters, if not many years.\"\n\nSupermicro is chasing a total addressable market it estimates at $25 billion. To meet the strong and growing demand, management has broken ground on two new production facilities near its Silicon Valley headquarters, in addition to the manufacturing facility already slated to come online in Malaysia.\n\nA compelling opportunity\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock has been growing like wildfire, up 766% over the past year as of this writing. With gains of that magnitude, you'd be tempted to believe the stock has gotten quite pricey, but nothing could be further from the truth. Despite its parabolic ascent, the stock still trades for just 2 times next year's sales -- the benchmark for an affordable stock.\n\nThe bargain-basement price, strong and growing demand for its products, and the secular tailwinds represented by AI illustrate why Supermicro is well positioned to benefit from this once-in-a-generation opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Will Super Micro Computer Be Worth More Than Intel by 2027?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) have been in the limelight over the past year or so thanks to the ability of both companies to capitalize on the booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. But a closer look at the stock price performance of both companies tells us that investors are heavily favoring one of them over the other.\n\nWhile share prices of Super Micro Computer (doing business as Supermicro) have jumped a stunning 776% in the past year, Intel has recorded relatively modest but solid gains of 71%, outpacing the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index's 57% gains. Supermicro stock's outstanding surge has brought its market cap from $5 billion a year ago to more than $48 billion as of this writing.\n\nIntel's market cap, on the other hand, has increased from $104 billion a year ago to $181 billion as of this writing. Supermicro, therefore, has enjoyed a much bigger surge in its market cap in the past year. But can it continue to outpace Intel on the stock market and become a bigger company in terms of market cap by 2027? Let's find out.\n\nSuper Micro Computer expects to grow at a faster pace than Intel\n\nA big reason why the market has rewarded Supermicro stock with eye-popping gains is because of the terrific growth in the company's revenue and earnings. A closer look at the chart below shows that Supermicro significantly outpaced Intel's top- and bottom-line performance. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nA closer look at the latest financial results of both companies shows why investors have been piling into Supermicro stock. The booming demand for AI chips turned out to be a bigger tailwind for Supermicro when compared to Intel. That's because Supermicro's server rack solutions allow data center operators to economically deploy AI accelerators in a way that they can reduce cooling and electricity costs while keeping performance at optimal levels.\n\nIt is worth noting that Supermicro's AI server solutions are used for mounting AI chips from Intel, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices. So, it doesn't matter which of these chipmakers is selling more AI chips because data center operators are quite likely to turn to Supermicro for its modular server solutions. The company therefore sees robust growth in its revenue but also must aggressively invest in capacity expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended on Dec. 31, 2023) more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $3.66 billion. The company anticipates $3.9 billion in revenue in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be three times its revenue from a year ago.\n\nSo, Supermicro's growth is all set to step on the gas in the current quarter. Additionally, the company expects to finish the year with $14.5 billion in revenue as compared to revenue of $7.1 billion in fiscal 2023. That would be a significant increase over the $7.1 billion in revenue it generated in the previous fiscal year.\n\nIntel, on the other hand, hasn't been able to capitalize on the AI chip boom yet because this market is currently being dominated by Nvidia. Intel's revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was up 10% year over year to $15.4 billion, while its full-year revenue fell 14% to $54.2 billion thanks to the weakness in the personal computer (PC) market.\n\nIt is worth noting that Intel's AI-related revenue pipeline stands at over $2 billion, according to management's comments on the January earnings conference call. Supermicro, meanwhile, gets more than half its revenue from selling AI server solutions. So, AI is driving growth in a more meaningful way for Supermicro, and its business is growing at a much faster pace as a result.\n\nMore importantly, Supermicro is increasing its manufacturing capacity and believes that its efforts could help increase its annual revenue capacity to $25 billion. That would be nearly double the company's revenue forecast in the current fiscal year. It won't be surprising to see Supermicro hitting that target over the next three years as the demand for AI servers is expected to increase fivefold between 2023 and 2027.\n\nAssuming Supermicro achieves $25 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, its three-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) would stand at 52%, using the fiscal 2023 revenue of $7.1 billion as the base. Intel's revenue, on the other hand, is anticipated to increase at a much slower pace of 6% in the current fiscal year to $57 billion, followed by double-digit increases in 2025 and 2026. INTC Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nHowever, will Supermicro's faster growth help it become a bigger company than Intel?\n\nCan Chipzilla be overtaken by Supermicro?\n\nAssuming Supermicro indeed generates $25 billion in annual revenue within the next three years and maintains its current price-to-sales ratio of 5.4 at that time, its market cap could increase to $135 billion. That would be almost three times the company's current market cap. Intel, meanwhile, is currently trading at 3.4 times sales. A similar sales multiple after three years would bring its market cap to $242 billion, a jump of 33% from current levels.\n\nSo, Intel is likely to remain the bigger company after three years, but it is worth noting that Supermicro has the potential to deliver a much stronger upside to investors. Supermicro isn't all that expensive when compared to Intel as far as the sales multiple is concerned, especially considering the eye-popping growth it is delivering. So it may be a good idea for investors to buy Supermicro because it has the potential to sustain its rally and remain a red-hot growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla --\u00a0always seem to find their names in the headlines.\n\nAmong this small group, perhaps Nvidia is the most closely followed. The company manufactures high-end semiconductor chips called graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are used in a variety of generative AI applications, including the training of large language models and machine learning.\n\nOne of Nvidia's closest allies is a much smaller company called Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). While Nvidia creates the technology powering semiconductors, Super Micro Computer plays an integral role behind the scenes related to how these chips fit into IT architecture such as server racks and storage clusters.\n\nInvestors have taken note of Super Micro's important role within the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape and have eagerly bought up the stock. Over the last year, shares of Super Micro are up almost 800%. Given such a magical run, some investors may be thinking it's too late to invest in this \"stealth Nvidia\" business.\n\nLet's dig into Super Micro's operation and understand why the stock has enjoyed so much investor enthusiasm. More importantly, by taking a look at the long-term outlook, investors may come to understand that Super Micro's run could just be getting started.\n\nSales are soaring, but there's more to the picture\n\nThe chart below makes one thing overwhelmingly obvious: Super Micro's revenue is off the charts (almost literally!). One of the clearest indicators of this revenue growth is the company's strong ties to Nvidia. Since demand for Nvidia's GPUs is high, the need for Super Micro's IT architecture designs is more important than ever. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWhile it is easy to become enamored by Super Micro's potential, there is much more to the picture than just robust sales growth. The company is actually a low-margin business. For the second quarter of its fiscal 2024, ended Dec. 31, 2023, Super Micro reported a gross margin of 15.4%. By comparison, its gross margin was 18.7% in the same period last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement attributed the margin deterioration to hefty investments in growth. More specifically, as GPUs become more sophisticated, optimal design architecture also becomes increasingly complex -- this is a costly undertaking as Super Micro is firing on all cylinders to acquire more market share.\n\nI understand the need to invest today to achieve sustained growth in the long run. However, if demand for AI chips begins to wane, Super Micro's profitability profile could experience a more pronounced dip. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat goes up, must come down\n\nFollowing its blowout earnings report in January, Super Micro shares continued to soar. While shares are up over 200% so far in 2024, trading activity has actually started to cool down after briefly eclipsing $1,000 per share earlier this month. SMCI Chart\n\nI see a couple of items at play here. First, nearly all of the megacap tech companies have reported earnings at this point. Investors now have a lot of data points to digest and sift through. It's going to take some time to assess which companies are best positioned to continue riding the AI wave. And there could be some problems for Super Micro specifically.\n\nFor starters, Nvidia recently shed some light on its supply chain woes -- a problem it's had for quite some time. There's a risk that this problem could have a domino effect on Super Micro.\n\nAnother one of Super Micro's strong relationships is with Nvidia's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices. After it reported mixed earnings earlier this year, some investors have legitimate concerns about AMD's long-term growth prospects. Again, should demand for AI chips plateau, both Nvidia and AMD will suffer, and that will affect Super Micro.\n\nThe valuation is tough to decipher SMCI PS Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates the forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of Super Micro Computer against a cohort of other IT architecture designers. At a forward P/S of 2.5, Super Micro is valued in line with International Business Machines. This is peculiar because IBM is a much larger, more prolific business that sells software and consulting services in addition to hardware.\n\nWall Street's expectations for Super Micro vary greatly. The consensus price target of $652 implies that Super Micro stock is currently overvalued -- and considerably so. However, Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities is calling for 48% upside from current levels and has a Street-high price target of $1,300.\n\nI think Super Micro still has a lot of room to run, but I would also not be surprised to see a pullback in demand at some point. For this reason, I'd be cautious about scooping up shares in Super Micro right now.\n\nIt could represent a hedge to other AI stocks in your portfolio, and I see the company as a winner in the long run. However, valuation is a legitimate concern, and buying into momentum stocks can come with a lot of risk. The most prudent thing to do right now may be to assess the company's ongoing earnings reports and keep a close eye on other businesses involved in the AI chip market as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Buying and holding great companies for the long run is a tried-and-tested way of making money in the stock market, as investors can not only benefit from secular growth opportunities by following this philosophy but also take advantage of the power of compounding.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the next big growth opportunity for investors. Bloomberg estimates that the generative AI market, which was worth $40 billion in 2022, could generate a whopping $1.3 trillion of annual revenue in 2032. The AI market is set to clock a compound annual growth rate of 42% during this period.\n\nAs such, now would be a good time for investors to invest in companies that could gain a lot from this lucrative opportunity in the long run. Buying AI stocks as a part of a diversified portfolio could even help investors become millionaires. For instance, a $10,000 investment made in Nvidia -- a pioneer in AI hardware -- a decade ago is now worth $1.68 million.\n\nOf course, expecting other AI stocks to replicate Nvidia's stunning gains isn't logical. However, buying shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) with $10,000 in investible cash could be a smart long-term move.\n\nAssuming you have $10,000 at your disposal after settling your bills, clearing expensive debt, and having saved enough for an emergency fund, putting that money into TSMC and Super Micro could help you construct a million-dollar portfolio. Let's see why.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nThe demand for semiconductors is booming thanks to AI. The global semiconductor market generated $315 billion in revenue in 2013, according to Gartner, a number that increased to $533 billion last year. So the global semiconductor market added $218 billion in revenue during the past decade. AI is set to drive much stronger growth for the global semiconductor market over the next decade.\n\nAllied Market Research estimates that AI chip revenue could hit nearly $384 billion a year in 2032, posting a CAGR of 38%. TSMC gives investors a solid way to capitalize on this huge end-market opportunity. That's because the Taiwan-based company is the world's leading foundry, with an estimated market share of 58%, according to TrendForce. It enjoys a massive lead over second-place Samsung, which has a market share of just over 12%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe foundry business model means TSMC manufactures chips for other companies. Its customers include\u00a0 Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices, among others. The big surge in the demand for AI chips has started driving solid growth for TSMC. Sales of the company's advanced chips made on a 5-nanometer (nm) process node have gained impressive traction in recent quarters.\n\nWhat's more, TSMC is now anticipating its 3nm process node, which will be deployed to make more powerful AI chips, to contribute $12.7 billion in revenue this year.\n\nIn December 2022, TSMC management said that its 3nm process node will be used by chipmakers to make end products worth $1.5 trillion within five years of starting volume production. Now that this process node is gaining traction and anticipated to account for 15% of TSMC's revenue this year, it seems set to move the needle in a bigger way for the company.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts are anticipating TSMC's bottom-line growth to jump significantly compared to last year's reading of $5.18 per share. TSM EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nIf TSMC is able to achieve $8.90 per share in earnings in 2026 and trades at 31 times forward earnings at that time (using the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple as a proxy for tech stocks), its share price could jump to $276. That points toward a 115% jump in three years, suggesting that TSMC could more than double investors' money.\n\nBut if you can continue to hold the stock for a much longer time, let's say 10 or 15 years, it could deliver much more upside and contribute nicely to a million-dollar portfolio.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer went public in 2007, and a $10,000 investment in the stock during its initial public offering (IPO) is now worth more than $970,000. SMCI Chart\n\nThe stock tripled in 2024 as AI has supercharged its growth. The company is expecting to finish its current fiscal year with revenue of $14.5 billion, a massive jump compared to the $7.1 billion revenue it generated in the preceding fiscal year. Super Micro's growth took off as its server solutions were being deployed for mounting AI chips. The good news is that Super Micro's end-market opportunity is set to expand significantly in the long run.\n\nAccording to a third-party estimate, the global AI server market could generate $177 billion in annual revenue in 2032, up from $38 billion last year. Super Micro's full-year revenue forecast for fiscal 2024 suggests that it is at the beginning of a terrific growth curve, especially considering that it is expected to corner a bigger share of this market.\n\nAccording to Barclays, the company was sitting on a 7% share of the overall server market last year. However, its efforts to bump its manufacturing capacity are expected to help it take share away from rivals. As such, it is easy to see why analysts are forecasting a 48% annual jump in the company's earnings for the next five years.\n\nBased on its fiscal 2023 earnings of $11.81 per share, Super Micro's bottom line could increase to almost $84 per share after five years. Multiplying the projected earnings with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 31 could send its stock price to $2,600. That would be triple its current stock price.\n\nOf course, the long-term opportunity in AI servers means that Super Micro could deliver even bigger gains over the next decade, which is why investors looking to build a million-dollar portfolio would do well to buy this AI stock with their investible cash.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Shares of Super Micro Computer rallied 13.5% in extended trade on Friday after it was announced the seller of AI-optimized servers will join the S&P 500.\n\nSuper Micro and Deckers Outdoor Corp will be added to the S&P 500 prior to the start of trading on Monday, March 18, coinciding with a quarterly rebalance of Wall Street's most widely followed stock benchmark, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a news release.\n\nThose two companies will replace Whirlpool Corp and Zion Bancorporation, S&P Dow Jones Indices said.\n\nIndex funds that track the S&P 500 are among the most popular investment tools on Wall Street, and those funds will have to purchase shares of Super Micro and Deckers in order to stay aligned with the benchmark's composition.\n\nSuch S&P 500 index funds have assets of about $7.8 trillion, according to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nSuper Micro sells high-end servers made with Nvidia's top-of-the-line AI processors, and its stock has more than tripled this year.\n\nWith Super Micro's stock market value reaching over $50 billion, investors had speculated the company would be added to the S&P 500.\n\nOn Friday, investors exchanged almost $10 billion worth of Super Micro's shares, eclipsing trading in Wall Street heavyweights including Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nIts jump in after-hours trading adds to a 4.5% surge during Friday's trading session.\n\nShares of Deckers rose 2.7% in extended trade, while Whirlpool dipped 1.7% and Zion Bancorporation fell 2%.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by Diane Craft)",

Shares of Super Micro and Deckers Outdoor were up 1% and 2%, respectively, in after-hours trading.\n\nTo qualify for the S&P 500, companies must be highly liquid US firms with a market capitalization of at least $15.8 billion, and meet profitability, liquidity and share-float standards.

        "title": "5 Tech Giants to Buy for Long-Term Gains as Nasdaq Thrives",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4%, recording its best year since 2020. The index\u2019s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle in January, although finally, it closed the first month of 2024 on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\n\nHowever, the tech-laden index regained momentum in February finishing the month with a 6.1% rally. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 9% compared with a 7.5% gain of the S&P 500 and 3.4% of the Dow. Notably, all three major stock indexes saw the fourth consecutive month of positive ending.\n\nMeanwhile, on Feb 29, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% to close at 16,091.92, marking its first closing record since November 2021. Its peers the Dow and the S&P 500 posted several all-time highs on both an intraday and a closing basis in the first two months of this year. Now, the tech-heavy index has joined the bandwagon.\n\nExplosion of Generative AI\n\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\n\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA Corp. NVDA \u2014 the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets \u2014 along with a solid outlook provided by management, raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\n\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. (TSM) \u2014 the world's largest contract chipmaker \u2014 has projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (\u201cWSTS\u201d) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales will reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\n\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite-listed technology behemoths namely NVIDIA, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days.\n\nMoreover, each stock\u2019s long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate is well above the market\u2019s benchmark S&P 500\u2019s current long-term growth rate of 11.6%. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA reported blockbuster fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The strong results of NVIDIA in the recently reported quarter confirm this trend. Quarterly adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 and exceeded the year-ago period earnings of $0.88.\n\nNVIDIA posted revenues of $22.1 billion for the quarter, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%. This compares favorably with the year-ago revenues of $6.1 billion. NVIDIA reported these robust financial numbers despite a stiff decline in its business in the key market of China. The U.S. government has banned exports of high-end AI-based NVIDIA chips in China for security reasons.\n\nWhat is most important is the guidance issued by management. Even after executing this tremendous success, management provided a rosy revenue guidance of $24 billion for the current quarter, implying an appreciation of 233.8% year over year.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 68.1% and 79.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 29.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.1% over the last seven days.\n\nAmazon.com has benefited from the Prime and AWS\u2019s momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers also favored the company. AMZN\u2019s robust advertising business contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positives. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.5% and 40%, respectively, for the current year. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 28.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days.\n\nMeta Platforms is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA\u2019s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid its growth. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms reported fourth-quarter 2023 earnings of $5.33 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.35%. The company reported earnings of $1.76 per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $40.11 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.87% and jumped 24.7% year over year. META expects total revenues between $34.5 billion and $37 billion for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 19.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 13% over the last 30 days.\n\nMicrosoft has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT were driven by the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 16.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.

(29:25) - Breaking Down Magnificent 7 Stocks Using The Earnings (35:30) - Episode Roundup: NVDA, SMCI, AAPL, VRT, MSFT Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss how the Zacks Rank stock ranking system got it right on NVIDIA and the other hot AI and datacenter stocks over the last year. The Rank was signaling something was going on in the datacenter and chip industries as the Rank moved to the highest level, the Strong Buy, last year and has mostly stayed at that level.\n\nCurrently, NVIDIA, Super Micro Computer and Vertiv, all three involved in AI and datacenters, remain Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks after their recent earnings reports.\n\nWere you noticing the Rank on these stocks? It was signaling something \"good\" was going on at these companies.\n\nWhat is the Zacks Rank?\n\nThe Zacks Rank is Zacks stock ranking system which ranks stocks into 5 categories with Strong Buys being the top category, and Strong Sells the bottom category. However, most stocks will be ranked in the middle, as Holds.\n\nZacks ranks over 4400 stocks. The top ranked stocks are rare. There are currently just 244 Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Rank is based on analyst earnings estimate revisions and can change daily. It is just a 1 to 3-month recommendation.\n\nHow to Get a Strong Buy Rank\n\nIn order to get the #1 Strong Buy rank, the analysts have to be in agreement and raising earnings estimates.\n\nWhen a company reports earnings, beats, and then raises guidance, that's the perfect conditions for the company to achieve the top rank. After a beat and raise, the analysts usually end up revising their own estimates higher.\n\nMany AI and datacenter companies have been beating, and raising, for several quarters. The Zacks Rank has been signaling for months that something \"good\" was going on.\n\nHow the Zacks Rank Got It Right on NVIDIA and Other Datacenter Stocks\n\n1. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nNVIDIA first became a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the second quarter of 2023, after it reported earnings and beat and raised.\n\nNVIDIA actually fell to a #2 (Buy) late in 2023 but it jumped back up to a #1 (Strong Buy) again in 2024 after the recent earnings beat and raise. Shares of NVIDIA are up 73% since May 30, 2023, which is a few days after earnings to the present.\n\nNVIDIA analysts are still raising estimates. Fourteen earnings estimates are higher for fiscal 2025 in the last week and none have been cut.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about NVIDIA?\n\n2. Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI\n\nSuper Micro Computer was a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as early as the fourth quarter of 2021. It also fell to a #2 (Buy) during that period before busting out to #1 (Strong Buy) rank again in the third quarter of 2023, after earnings.\n\nZacks only has 3 analyst estimates on Super Micro Computer for the full year, as it's not as highly followed on the Street as NVIDIA.\n\nBut those analysts are still bullish. 2 estimates have been revised higher on Super Micro Computer in the last month for both Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about Super Micro Computer?\n\n3. Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT\n\nVertiv, like NVIDIA, has been beating and raising every quarter for the last year. Vertiv became a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the same time as NVIDIA, in the second quarter of 2023. It has briefly fallen to a #2 (Buy) stock but has now reclaimed the Strong Buy rank.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Vertiv as well. 2 earnings estimates have been revised higher in the last week for both 2024 and 2025. Even though it's a large cap company, Zacks has just 3 estimates on the company for both years. It is not heavily covered on the Street.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about Vertiv?\n\nWhat Does the Zacks Rank Signal About Mega Cap AI?\n\n4. Alphabet Inc. GOOGL\n\nAlphabet has not been a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since the fourth quarter of 2021. It was briefly a #2 (Buy) in the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAlphabet is currently a Zacks #3 (Hold), which is where most stocks end up. The analysts are mixed on Alphabet for 2024. 10 estimates were raised for the full year in the last 30 days, but 7 were also cut during that time.\n\nIs the stock reflecting the uncertainty in Alphabet's earnings outlook?\n\n5. Microsoft Corp. MSFT\n\nMicrosoft hasn't been a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since the first quarter of 2020. It has, however, recently been a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. It was a Buy stock in the fourth quarter of 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. It remains a #2 (Buy) stock.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Microsoft for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. 17 earnings estimates are higher for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 in the last 30 days, with no analyst estimate cuts.\n\nWith all that bullishness, why isn't Microsoft a #1 (Strong Buy) instead of a #2?\n\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Using the Zacks Rank?\n\nTune into this week's podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT, MSFT and GOOGL in her own personal portfolio. SMCI is in Zacks Insider Trader portfolio and VRT is in Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "The stock of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is rallying in Thursday's trading. The share price was up 5.9% as of 12:30 p.m. ET today, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nSuper Micro is gaining ground today thanks to bullish news for Nvidia. In addition to positive coverage for the chipmaker from an analyst, it was also announced that a new partner had joined Nvidia's machine-vision platform.\n\nNvidia gives Super Micro another boost\n\nMovements for Nvidia's share price often have ripple effects for other companies in artificial intelligence (AI). Shares of the leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) were up 1.7% as of 12:30 p.m. today, and the bullish momentum was lifting Super Micro and other high-profile AI stocks.\n\nIn a research note by Tigress Financial's Ivan Feinseth yesterday, the analyst maintained a buy rating on Nvidia and raised his one-year price target from $790 per share to $985. And Rail Vision announced that it's joining Nvidia's Metropolis machine-vision platform to advance the safety and efficiency of rail travel.\n\nWhat's next for Super Micro Computer stock?\n\nAt least in the short term, Super Micro stock will likely continue to make moves in conjunction with shifts for Nvidia. Super Micro uses Nvidia's GPUs for its high-performance rack servers.\n\nSuper Micro's long-term stock performance will mostly be shaped by its own business results. The good news for investors is that the company is serving up great results and looks poised to benefit from sustained demand tailwinds.\n\nIf Super Micro hits the midpoint of management's guidance target for revenue of approximately $14.5 billion this year, sales will be up roughly 104% annually, and there's a good chance rapid expansion will continue from there.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Will Super Micro Computer's Stock Reach $1,500?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has been the best stock to own in 2024, with few exceptions. So far, it has essentially tripled just two months into the year.\n\nThis rise has caused it to cross the $1,000 threshold a few times, but with how pricey the stock is, it has become a bit volatile. But could it cross $1,500 sometime soon? Let's find out.\n\nSupermicro's growth has been impressive\n\nSuper Micro Computer (often called Supermicro) is capitalizing on the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race. It is a popular choice for companies looking to source a highly customizable data center server. Because it works closely with GPU maker Nvidia, Supermicro can help squeeze out every ounce of performance from Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro is starting to see unreal growth. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue rose 103% year over year to $3.67 billion. But its guidance for the next quarter is what got investors excited.\n\nIn the third quarter, it expects revenue from $3.7 to $4.1 billion, indicating 188% to 219% growth. This catalyst was like dumping gas on an already roaring fire, and Supermicro's stock has risen nearly 75% since these results were announced.\n\nBut could these projections support a $1,500 stock price?\n\nSupermicro's stock is already priced at a premium\n\nUsing trailing earnings to value a company isn't wise for a quickly changing company. Instead, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which includes analyst projections, is a better choice.\n\nSince the calendar flipped to 2024, Supermicro's valuation skyrocketed. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhen the company entered the year valued at 15 times forward earnings, it was a steal. But at 40 times forward earnings, it no longer holds that designation.\n\nWhile Supermicro is at the top of its industry, there isn't much difference between its products and those offered by Hewlett-Packard or IBM. But because Supermicro is focused on the server business, it's a pure-play investment, unlike the others. This makes it a more popular stock pick than the other two, which are bogged down by legacy businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also worth noting that Supermicro trades at a higher price than Nvidia (32 times forward earnings).\n\nWith that kind of valuation, I'd pass on buying Supermicro's stock right now, but that's only a one-year view. Management aims to achieve $25 billion a year in recurring revenue, which changes this analysis completely.\n\nIf Supermicro can maintain its 8% profit margin and achieve $25 billion in revenue, that would give it $2 billion in earnings each year. With the stock trading at a $48 billion market cap right now, the company would be at a hypothetical P/E ratio of 24.\n\nFor a hardware company, that's either about right or a bit pricey, which is a big red flag for me.\n\nIf a company must hit its long-term targets to achieve a reasonable valuation, then it's probably not the best stock pick in the world.\n\nSo, could Supermicro's stock hit $1,500? Maybe. But if it does, it will be because market hype pushed it that high or management reassessed their long-term revenue targets. But right now, Super Micro Computer doesn't look attractive, especially when Nvidia can be purchased at a cheaper price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Has Been Hailed as a \"Stealth Nvidia.\" Time to Buy?",
        "content": "Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are playing a major role in overall market dynamics right now. Last year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared more than 40% thanks in large part to euphoria surrounding the AI narrative.\n\nSpecifically, the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Nvidia -- have had a major influence on the record-setting performance by the S&P 500 so far in 2024.\n\nBut there are many opportunities beyond those seven. One company that has experienced quite a bit of volatility over the last year is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), which works extremely closely with semiconductor leaders Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nGiven that Super Micro Computer stock has surged 812% over the last year, it's no surprise that one Wall Street pundit has hailed the company as a \"stealth Nvidia.\"\n\nCould Super Micro have prospects as lucrative as Nvidia stock? Maybe. But a more thorough understanding of the company's business, underlying market trends, and valuation compared to peers should help determine if it is a buy right now.\n\nWhy is Super Micro affiliated with Nvidia?\n\nBoth Nvidia and AMD manufacture a series of high-end chips called graphics processing units (GPUs), which play an instrumental role in quantum computing, especially as it relates to generative AI. Super Micro does not produce semiconductors itself, but it plays an important role in how they are deployed.\n\nThe company specializes in designing IT architecture including server racks and storage clusters. Given the unprecedented demand for GPUs, it's not surprising that its business has been a major beneficiary. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nI'll concede that the slope of the revenue line above is impressive. However, there are some important things to consider before pouring into Super Micro. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBe wary of the stock's movement\n\nThe chart below illustrates the stock movements of Nvidia and Super Micro over the last year.\n\nStory continues SMCI Chart\n\nNot only are both stocks up significantly, but they have also demonstrated eerily similar ebbs and flows throughout the last 12 months. As I wrote in a prior article, Super Micro's stock seems to trade almost in parallel with that of Nvidia. While some investors have undoubtedly profited from this theme, this dynamic does not come without significant risk.\n\nFor example, Arm Holdings is a smaller and somewhat troubled semiconductor company. But an encouraging earnings report earlier this year coupled with a newly revealed ownership stake from Nvidia sent Arm stock soaring, with its market cap nearly doubling in just a matter of days.\n\nWhile Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings each have some investment merit, the overlapping feature between the two companies is that both have witnessed abnormally high buying activity thanks in large part to their relationships with Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest in Super Micro?\n\nAs long as demand for GPUs remain high, Super Micro should remain a beneficiary one way or another. But the primary risk I see is the company's heavy reliance on Nvidia in particular. SMCI PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe chart above benchmarks Super Micro stock against a cohort of other IT-systems integrators on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. The analysis clearly illustrates that Super Micro's P/S of 5.3 is essentially double that of its next closest competitor, International Business Machines. Of note, IBM is a much more diversified conglomerate that even sells its own AI-powered software in addition to its many other businesses.\n\nThe other important thing to drive home here is that many other IT architecture companies trade at a P/S of less than 1. While it could be argued that Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell Technologies, and Lenovo have lacked innovation in recent years, the disparity among legacy players and Super Micro is tough to brush aside.\n\nTo me, Super Micro will need to generate market-leading revenue and profit growth in order to justify its premium valuation. But I see this as unlikely as demand for GPUs will eventually normalize, which will affect Super Micro's long-term performance. Moreover, it's paramount that the company foster and nurture relationships outside of Nvidia and AMD, since the GPU market will begin to see other players emerge -- potentially from big tech stalwarts like Amazon.\n\nWhile I understand Wall Street's metaphorical comparison to Nvidia, investors should understand that Super Micro and chipmakers are very different businesses. The former could represent a unique stock to own outside of traditional AI opportunities.\n\nBut it's important to realize that the long-term investment prospects between Super Micro and other semiconductor leaders like Nvidia are not the same and carry much different risk profiles.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "You may be short-sighted if you think generative artificial intelligence is the best thing happening to technology stocks this decade. There also are great opportunities right now in A-rated quantum computing stocks.\n\nQuantum computing will surely change the computer industry as we know it. It will be the next great breakthrough in technology. Quantum computing uses computer hardware and algorithms to use quantum mechanics to solve problems that classic computers can\u2019t touch.\n\nSimply put, classic computers operate on chips that use bits for computations. The bits can show either a value of zero or one and a combination of zeros and ones used to complete tasks in modern computers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut quantum computers operate at subatomic particles, such as electrons or photons. Quantum bits allow these particles to exist in more than one state (zero or one) simultaneously, greatly increasing processing speeds.\n\nQuantum hardware is relatively new (roughly three decades) but we\u2019re just now starting to see some inroads in everyday computing. According to a Zapata survey, more than two-thirds of companies with revenues of $250 million and computing budgets of at least $1 million are spending more than $1 million yearly to develop quantum computing applications.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader analyzed quantum computing stocks with the best fundamentals, earnings performance and momentum today. These are the best of the best A-rated quantum computing stocks to buy.\n\nHere are seven that all get \u201cA\u201d ratings in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is perhaps the most established of the quantum computing companies.\n\nIn 2016 it put the first quantum processor on the cloud, which made it possible for anyone to run experiments. In 2019, it launched the first circuit-based commercial quantum computer, the Quantum System One.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe innovations keep coming. Its first universal quantum computer with over 1,000 qubits rolled out in 2023, as well as new modular quantum processors.\n\nIn December it announced Quantum System Two, its first modular quantum computer that it calls \u201cthe cornerstone of IBM\u2019s quantum-centric supercomputing architecture.\u201d\n\nIBM has deep pockets for this research, which will surely continue to pay off down the road. The company has a market cap of nearly $170 billion and more than $13 billion of cash on hand to pour into research. And the stock is doing well, up 42% in the last year on the strength of $17.4 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago.\n\nIBM stock gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gets a lot of publicity and credit for its work in generative AI and its investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. But its work with quantum computing is equally impressive.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure Quantum is a cloud service that allows users to build and refine quantum algorithms. It includes tools to accelerate scientific discovery, as well as to use natural language to work through chemistry and materials sciences problems.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s advanced work with AI is notable when you consider the potential of quantum computing. As Forbes writes, \u201cQuantum computing, an entirely new way of processing information, when combined with AI, has the potential, without exaggeration, to bring about a new computing revolution. Transformation may be an understatement.\u201d\n\nMSFT stock is up 60% in the last 12 months and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) already is staking its claim as the most influential stock of the decade. NVDA stock is up 238% in the last year as the company closes in on the $2 trillion mark in market capitalization.\n\nWhile Nvidia is known for its powerful graphics processing units that make generative AI possible, the company also has its Cuda Quantum platform, a first-of-its-kind open-source platform that allows developers to integrate and program quantum processing units, GPUs, and central processing units (CPUs) into a single system.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to ignore Nvidia\u2019s efforts in quantum computing when you consider its massive success in creating the technology to power generative AI. Nvidia\u2019s revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter was $22.1 billion, up 265% from a year ago, and the company brought in $60.9 billion in revenue for the full year.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is making some impressive gains this year up 20% so far in 2024 and 128% in the last 12 months as it finally starts competing with Nvidia in the generative AI market.\n\nIt partnered with the quantum computing company Riverlane, which is using AMD\u2019s Zinq UltraScale+ RFSoC as a platform to act as an interface between Riverlane\u2019s control software and the high-speed pulse lasers that are fired to control qubits.\n\nAMD\u2019s revenue in the fourth quarter was $6.16 billion, up 10% from a year ago. Net income jumped more than 3,000% to $667 million, and earnings per share rose from 1 cent a year ago to 41 cents per share in the most recent quarter.\n\nAMD stock gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nQuickLogic (QUIK) AI.

        "content": "(1:00) - Using The Zacks Rank And Earnings Reports To Your Advantage (11:35) - Learning From Nvidia\u2019s Parabolic Stock Performance (18:00) - Super Micro Computers Strong Performance: What Are The Analysts Saying? (29:25) - Breaking Down Magnificent 7 Stocks Using The Earnings (35:30) - Episode Roundup: NVDA, SMCI, AAPL, VRT, MSFT Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #392 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss how the Zacks Rank stock ranking system got it right on NVIDIA and the other hot AI and datacenter stocks over the last year. The Rank was signaling something was going on in the datacenter and chip industries as the Rank moved to the highest level, the Strong Buy, last year and has mostly stayed at that level.\n\nCurrently, NVIDIA, Super Micro Computer and Vertiv, all three involved in AI and datacenters, remain Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks after their recent earnings reports.\n\nWere you noticing the Rank on these stocks? It was signaling something \u201cgood\u201d was going on at these companies.\n\nWhat is the Zacks Rank?\n\nThe Zacks Rank is Zacks stock ranking system which ranks stocks into 5 categories with Strong Buys being the top category, and Strong Sells the bottom category. However, most stocks will be ranked in the middle, as Holds.\n\nZacks ranks over 4400 stocks. The top ranked stocks are rare. There are currently just 244 Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is based on analyst earnings estimate revisions and can change daily. It is just a 1 to 3-month recommendation.\n\nHow to Get a Strong Buy Rank\n\nIn order to get the #1 Strong Buy rank, the analysts have to be in agreement and raising earnings estimates.\n\nWhen a company reports earnings, beats, and then raises guidance, that\u2019s the perfect conditions for the company to achieve the top rank. After a beat and raise, the analysts usually end up revising their own estimates higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany AI and datacenter companies have been beating, and raising, for several quarters. The Zacks Rank has been signaling for months that something \u201cgood\u201d was going on.\n\nHow the Zacks Rank Got it Right on NVIDIA and other Datacenter Stocks\n\n1. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA first became a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the second quarter of 2023, after it reported earnings and beat and raised.\n\nNVIDIA actually fell to a #2 (Buy) late in 2023 but it jumped back up to a #1 (Strong Buy) again in 2024 after the recent earnings beat and raise. Shares of NVIDIA are up 73% since May 30, 2023, which is a few days after earnings to the present.\n\nNVIDIA analysts are still raising estimates. Fourteen earnings estimates are higher for fiscal 2025 in the last week and none have been cut.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about NVIDIA?\n\n2. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer was a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as early as the fourth quarter of 2021. It also fell to a #2 (Buy) during that period before busting out to #1 (Strong Buy) rank again in the third quarter of 2023, after earnings.\n\nZacks only has 3 analyst estimates on Super Micro Computer for the full year, as it\u2019s not as highly followed on the Street as NVIDIA.\n\nBut those analysts are still bullish. 2 estimates have been revised higher on Super Micro Computer in the last month for both Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about Super Micro Computer?\n\n3. Vertiv Holdings Co. (VRT)\n\nVertiv, like NVIDIA, has been beating and raising every quarter for the last year. Vertiv became a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the same time as NVIDIA, in the second quarter of 2023. It has briefly fallen to a #2 (Buy) stock but has now reclaimed the Strong Buy rank.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Vertiv as well. 2 earnings estimates have been revised higher in the last week for both 2024 and 2025. Even though it\u2019s a large cap company, Zacks has just 3 estimates on the company for both years. It is not heavily covered on the Street.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about Vertiv?\n\nWhat\u2019s Does the Zacks Rank Signal About Mega Cap AI?\n\n4. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet has not been a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since the fourth quarter of 2021. It was briefly a #2 (Buy) in the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAlphabet is currently a Zacks #3 (Hold), which is where most stocks end up. The analysts are mixed on Alphabet for 2024. 10 estimates were raised for the full year in the last 30 days, but 7 were also cut during that time.\n\nIs the stock reflecting the uncertainty in Alphabet\u2019s earnings outlook?\n\n5. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t been a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since the first quarter of 2020. It has, however, recently been a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. It was a Buy stock in the fourth quarter of 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. It remains a #2 (Buy) stock.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Microsoft for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. 17 earnings estimates are higher for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 in the last 30 days, with no analyst estimate cuts.\n\nWith all that bullishness, why isn\u2019t Microsoft a #1 (Strong Buy) instead of a #2?\n\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Using the Zacks Rank?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT, MSFT and GOOGL in her own personal portfolio.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer's (NASDAQ: SMCI) share price slipped in Wednesday's trading. The artificial intelligence (AI) stock ended the daily session down 4.1%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nTop AI stocks lost ground in today's trading, and Supermicro got caught up in the pullback. Recent filings published through the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed that members of Nvidia's board of directors had recently sold roughly $80 million worth of company stock.\n\nIn addition to news that Nvidia insiders had recently unloaded shares, an analyst's recent coverage of SoundHound AI stock likely impacted Supermicro's share price today. Citing valuation concerns, a Northland analyst lowered the firm's rating on SoundHound from outperform to market perform in a note published today. As a result of these catalysts, investors became more cautious about Super Micro Computer Stock today.\n\nCan Super Micro Computer stock still deliver huge gains?\n\nNvidia, SoundHound AI, and Super Micro Computer have emerged as some of the market's most visible and most explosive artificial intelligence stocks. When major players in the space see significant valuation pullbacks, it tends to have ripple effects for other companies in the otherwise red-hot tech category.\n\nEven with today's pullback, Supermicro stock has seen incredible gains in conjunction with rising demand for its rack-server technologies. The company's share price is still up 187% year to date, despite today's sell-off.\n\nDemand for Super Micro Computer's server and storage solutions has skyrocketed as leading tech companies have made moves to ramp up their AI processing and data transmission capabilities. It looks like these performance catalysts will continue to be quite strong in the near term.\n\nFor Supermicro's current fiscal year, which ends June 30, the company's midpoint guidance calls for sales of roughly $14.5 billion. If performance were to come in at that level, revenue would more than double, compared to the $7.12 billion in sales the business posted in its last fiscal year.\n\nStory continues SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWith Supermicro stock trading at roughly 37.7 times this year's expected earnings and roughly 27.5 times next year's expected profits, the company has a growth-dependent valuation, even on the heels of today's valuation pullback. On the other hand, recent momentum for the business has been nothing short of incredible.\n\nThere are good reasons to think that growth will continue at very high rates over the next few years and beyond. Supermicro isn't a low-risk stock, but there are signs that it could surge above current pricing levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 26, 2024\n\nKeith Noonan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Is Falling Due to Nvidia and SoundHound AI News Today",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock is pulling back in Wednesday's trading. The company's share price was down 2.9% as of 3 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The otherwise red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) stock had been down as much as 4.6% earlier in the day's trading.\n\nWhile there isn't any business-specific news driving Supermicro's stock lower today, the company's valuation is dipping due to developments for other high-profile AI companies. In particular, news surrounding Nvidia stock and SoundHoundAI stock appears to be driving sell-offs for Supermicro today.\n\nNvidia's dip is impacting Supermicro stock\n\nWhen it comes to shaping valuation moves in the broader artificial intelligence space, no company is more influential than Nvidia. The AI leader posted fourth-quarter results last week that crushed the market's expectations; the report powered big gains for its own stock and also had the effect of boosting share prices for other top AI players. On the heels of explosive gains, investors now appear to be cooling on Nvidia stock a bit.\n\nYesterday, Nvidia published filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealing that two members of the company's board of directors had sold shares last week. Per the public filings, board members Harvey Jones and Mark Perry sold shares worth $53 million and $11.9 million, respectively.\n\nWhile the stock sales don't necessarily say much about Nvidia's long-term performance outlook, they arrive at a time when investors may be wondering what the next major near-term performance catalyst for the stock will be. Nvidia's share price was down roughly 0.6% as of 3 p.m. ET and had been down roughly 2% earlier in the day. The sell-off dampened enthusiasm for Super Micro Computer and other high-profile AI names.\n\nAnalyst coverage on SoundHound AI weighs on Supermicro\n\nFollowing explosive gains for Nvidia and Supermicro, SoundHound AI has recently emerged as the market's latest red-hot artificial intelligence stock. The company's share price has rocketed 247% higher over the last month, but recent coverage from a Northland analyst suggested that it may be time to pump the brakes a bit.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a note released today, Northland's lead analyst on the company downgraded his rating on the stock from \"outperform\" to \"market perform.\" SoundHound AI stock was down 6.3% as of 3 p.m. ET and had been down as much as 14% earlier in the day, and the bearish momentum is having some mild spillover effects for Supermicro stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 28, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are W.W. Grainger GWW, Super Micro Computer SMCI, Casey's General Stores CASY, AllianceBernstein AB and Sprouts Farmers Market SFM.\n\nBet on Winning DuPont Analysis with These 5 Stocks\n\nReturn on equity (ROE) is one of the most favored metrics of investors. It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.\n\nHowever, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements \u2013 operating management, management of assets and the capital structure \u2013 related to the financial condition of a company. Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:\n\nROE = Net Income/Equity\n\nNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)\n\nROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity Multiplier\n\nThe screener yields winning stocks like W.W. Grainger,Super Micro Computer, Casey's General Stores, AllianceBernstein and Sprouts Farmers Market.\n\nWhy Use DuPont?\n\nAlthough one can't play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn't always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.\n\nIn fact, it also sheds light on the company's leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.\n\nInvestors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company's financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.\n\nHere are five out of six stocks that made it through the screen:\n\nSuper Micro Computer: The Zacks Rank #1 company designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.
