        "content": "Investors with an interest in Food - Miscellaneous stocks have likely encountered both BRF (BRFS) and Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, BRF has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Celsius Holdings Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that BRFS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nBRFS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.39, while CELH has a forward P/E of 44.40. We also note that BRFS has a PEG ratio of 0.31. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 1.43.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for BRFS is its P/B ratio of 1.24. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CELH has a P/B of 31.69.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to BRFS's Value grade of A and CELH's Value grade of F.\n\nBRFS is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that BRFS is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) Rises As Market Takes a Dip: Key Facts",
        "content": "In the latest market close, Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) reached $46.40, with a +1.65% movement compared to the previous day. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.51%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.93%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the company had lost 19.31% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 0.13% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.26% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Celsius Holdings Inc. will be of great interest to investors. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $0.23, showcasing a 35.29% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $388.87 million, up 19.33% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.05 per share and a revenue of $1.61 billion, representing changes of +36.36% and +22.48%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Celsius Holdings Inc. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 2.11% lower. Celsius Holdings Inc. is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nWith respect to valuation, Celsius Holdings Inc. is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 43.67. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 16.66.\n\nWe can also see that CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 1.41. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Food - Miscellaneous was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.06 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Food - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 175, finds itself in the bottom 31% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "1 Growth Stock Down 54% to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Temperatures are heating up. Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) is cooling down. Shares of the sparkling sports drink company have plummeted 54% since hitting an all-time high of $99.62 in March. It's a stark reversal in fortune for the once high-flying stock that was breathing new life into the functional beverage market with its scintillating top-line growth.\n\nCelsius stock is still roughly where it was a year ago, more than doubling over the last three years. It's also a wealth-altering 25-bagger for anyone who owned it through the last five years. The starting lines are irrelevant beyond the taxable cost basis, though. Losing more than half of your money in four months in an otherwise bubbly market is enough to turn any stomach.\n\nAnd it's not just stomachs that are turning. Tailwinds have turned to headwinds. Bulls have turned to bears. Let's take a closer look at how things fell apart for the Celsius story, but also why now could be a good time to approach the discarded beverage stock from a contrarian perspective.\n\nPutting the \"sell\" in Celsius\n\nThe most common reason given for the dramatic slide in Celsius stock is the equally dramatic slide in its once jaw-dropping revenue growth. Annual sales have more than doubled for Celsius in the last three years. This year has been a different story. Revenue went from soaring 95% in the fourth quarter of last year to a mere human 37% year-over-year jump in the first quarter of this year. This would seem to be the obvious culprit, but it's an incomplete picture.\n\nThe shares did inch lower on May 7 after the company posted its first-quarter results, but the pessimism didn't last. Revenue may have fallen short of Wall Street pro targets, but the rare miss was explained away as inventory adjustments by distributor and minority shareholder PepsiCo. On the other end of the income statement, Celsius actually came through with another double-digit percentage beat.\n\nQuarter EPS Estimate EPS Actual Beat Q1 2023 $0.07 $0.13 86% Q2 2023 $0.09 $0.17 89% Q3 2023 $0.16 $0.30 88% Q4 2023 $0.15 $0.17 13% Q1 2024 $0.27 $0.19 42%\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. EPS = earnings per share.\n\nTwo weeks after the initially poorly received report, Celsius stock was less than a dollar away from hitting another all-time high. In short, the stock has been cut in half since well after its last financial update.\n\nOne can turn to blaming the growing overall negative sentiment for the massive drop over the last two months, but that's not fair either. More than 16% of the outstanding shares were being sold short in March when the shares were peaking. The bearish wagers on the stock have fallen to less than 9% of the share count. A short squeeze should've sent the stock higher, not lower.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe swoon over the last two months draws us closer to the real problem here. Reports began to surface in late May of third-party retail channel checks showing a slowdown in Celsius sales. Rising temperatures could be doing more damage to your Celsius stock than your A/C bill. Even PepsiCo has recently noted that many people are coping with this hot summer by replacing sparkling beverages with more conventional hydration options. This could be just the tip of the watery iceberg, but since then several analysts have been slashing their price targets on Celsius stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFinding liquidity in the liquid\n\nThere's no denying that the last couple of months have been brutal if you're a Celsius shareholder -- like me. Optimism may not seem fashionable, but let's size up the opportunity here. The stock has been cut in half over just the last two months, but the same can't be said about its fundamentals. In the last 60 days analysts have gone from expecting $1.09 in earnings per share this year to $1.07. Looking out to next year, analyst estimates have fallen from $1.45 per share to $1.38 per share. The numbers are going in the wrong direction, but it's not as if profit expectations have mirrored the stock's decline.\n\nCelsius -- which analysts feel can continue to grow revenue at a 25% clip for the next couple of years -- is trading at a reasonable 33 times earnings. The second quarter that it will report early next month may potentially be painful, but what if that's already been more than discounted by now? How silly will today's sellers be if sales start to pick back up again as temperatures start to come down? What happens once we lap the PepsiCo inventory adjustments?\n\nIf one can argue that Celsius stock was priced for perfection in the springtime, the argument can be even louder that the shares are priced for imperfection now. A whiff of bad news sent the stock reeling. What happens at the first whiff of a positive development? Celsius may be out of favor as an investment, but its product isn't exactly out of favor. There's no point in trying to nail the bottom in any cascading stock, but there seems to be more upside than downside for investors at today's price point.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "The Nasdaq 100 is a list of the 100 most valuable companies traded on the Nasdaq index as measured by market capitalization. The Nasdaq index is generally associated with the technology sector. However, the Nasdaq 100 spans all industries and sectors. And, like all other indexes, the Nasdaq 100 includes many undervalued stocks that are not to be ignored.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide diversity of sectors represented in this article including everything from tech to healthcare to utilities and more. The firms discussed here are undervalued and offer a lot of\u00a0 upside to investors.\n\nIdentifying undervalued opportunities is primarily about understanding why a company is currently undervalued and why it should rise moving forward. All of the stocks discussed below exhibit positive factors suggesting that they are strong investments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are not get-rich quick opportunities for the most part. Instead, these stocks represent firms with what look to be sustainable competitive advantages.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) sign on the front of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) is clearly undervalued at the moment. A cursory look at the target prices assigned to its shares shows as much. This source indicates that KDP shares are underpriced by approximately 10% and this one indicates potential returns are closer to 30%. Neither of those scenarios includes the positive effects of the dividend that KDP shares provide. It boosts returns by 2.6% at the moment.\n\nSome readers may be with Keurig Dr Pepper as an investment because it is getting a lot of attention lately. Some analysts are even beginning to compare it favorably to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). The thrust of that argument hinges on the notion that KDP shares are undervalued and thus have more upside. Although KO outperforms KDP in multiple key metrics KDP remains underpriced. I also like the argument that Keurig Dr Pepper benefits from a strong coffee business that somewhat shields it from the negative potential of declining carbonated drink consumption.\n\nBeyond all of those generalities is the fact that KDP\u2019s earnings are steadily rising and its business rock solid overall. It\u2019s undervalued and steady which is a combination most any investor can appreciate.\n\nWorkday (WDAY) Workday Layoffs. A close-up view of a Workday (WDAY Stock) sign in Pleasanton, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorkday (NASDAQ:WDAY) CEO Carl Eschenbach offered a succinct summary of why its stock is highly attractive when he stated that:\n\n\u201cWith the emergence of Generative AI, the shifting talent landscape, and pressure to realize operational efficiencies, Workday has never been more relevant. Our strong value proposition, investments in key growth initiatives, and leadership in AI are paying off as more organizations turn to Workday to manage their two most important assets \u2013 their people and money.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe application of generative AI to enterprise scale software is one of the biggest growth opportunities today. Companies like Workday are well positioned to grow rapidly as AI transforms operational efficiency both within the firm itself and for its external clients.\n\nThat\u2019s the high level catalyst investors should consider overall. Drill down into current financials and there\u2019s plenty to like otherwise. Revenues are growing at approximately 18% and Workday has dozens of AI use cases in development. The company should be able to upsell those AI applications into its recurring revenue base and find new partners as well. Workday is particularly attractive based on its high gross margins in a software sector already known for particularly high margins. That will remain a key driver of its business and a prime reason to invest.\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nMonster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) stock represents a company that is easy to appreciate: The company sells an in-demand product that has become a household name while maintaining strong business fundamentals.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with investing in a company that projects roughly 10-12% top line growth annually into the near future with moderately quicker earnings growth. Yet Monster Beverage remains undervalued nonetheless. I think the reasons for that are easy to understand. For one, MNST shares don\u2019t include a dividend unlike other popular beverage stocks like KO and KDP. So, there\u2019s no income potential, only upside appreciation potential. Second, other energy drink stocks like Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) are arguably more exciting with their early growth narratives. Neither of those arguments invalidates Monster Beverage\u2019s steady fundamentals, though.\n\nThat\u2019s where it shines and will continue to shine.\u00a0 Monster Beverage has a strong history of creating highly positive cash flows from its investments. I personally am a big fan of companies that can create profit over the long term and Monster Beverage is one of them.\n\nAnalog Devices (ADI) Analog Devices (ADI) sign outside of building\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany AI stock plays like Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) can simultaneously appear overvalued and undervalued. Analysts either believe that the continued emergence of AI provides a catalyst for substantial upside or that prices are too high relative to historical multiples. Analog Devices is far from the only AI stock currently being viewed in that light.\n\nThe company managed to deliver results above the midpoint of guidance during the most recent quarter. Analog Devices did so even as inventory issues continue to work against it. The company managed to produce $3.1 billion in free cash flows and returned $675 million to shareholders during the quarter. So, while the markets continue to be concerned that AI is overblown, ADI continues to outperform.\n\nThe biggest positive sign for Analog Devices is that inventory levels are stabilizing after the massive buying frenzy over the past few years. The company expects a return to sequential growth in Q3. That suggests investors who buy now will be rewarded near the end of the year. That should create a profit taking opportunity or provide reason to hold on and await further growth.\n\nGE Healthcare Technologies (GEHC) GE Healthcare (GEHC) sign. GE Healthcare is an American company founded in 2014 and spun off from GE in 2023.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nGE Healthcare Technologies (NASDAQ:GEHC) is a young stock spun off from its parent company in early 2023. GE wanted to concentrate on the industrial businesses that make up its core. That meant spinning off a healthcare unit that produces complex imaging machinery while focusing on aviation and power production.\n\nThat\u2019s where the company stands today: An independent business and stock that has appeal investors should understand. GEHC shares are undervalued at the moment. Those shares currently trade for $82 which is near the low analyst target price. The consensus price target sits at $94 and GEHC includes a very modest dividend yielding 0.15%.\u00a0 There\u2019s obvious upside for investors willing to risk it.\n\nThose investors should remain confident because per share earnings are expected to boom by more than 43% in 2024. GE Healthcare is still finding its way following the spin off but there\u2019s plenty to like fundamentally. None of that mentions the fact that AI is highly applicable to healthcare imaging providing a real growth opportunity to GE Healthcare to consider.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) stock represents a company that is part Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), part Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and part Visa (NYSE:V). It has emerged as the eCommerce and fintech leader for a maturing Latin American economy that it dominates.\n\nWhether LATAM customers are ordering goods online, paying for those goods, or simply becoming banked, there\u2019s a good chance MercadoLibre is involved. The company\u2019s Q1 earnings report is pretty much par for the course: 36% revenue growth combined with similar payment volume growth.\n\nTopline growth is expected to fall to approximately 20% in 2025 and level out thereafter for several years. However, EPS growth is going to approach 40% during that period and that alone will continue to make MELI shares highly sought after.\n\nMercadoLibre is undervalued by approximately 20% based on analyst opinion from this metrics-based site. The company continues to Garner favorable comparisons to Amazon with the caveat that it is much more profitable earlier and also has distinct fintech advantages.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a cloud application security platform software stock that offers a lot to investors at present. The shares also have between 12 and 30% upside depending on whether you consider the consensus price or the high target price.\n\nDatadog may very well reach that latter growth rate if AI security software takes off in the same way that hardware has in 2023 and 2024. That\u2019s what some analysts anticipate will happen. Those same analysts expect that the importance of security at the enterprise scale will drive sales for firms including Datadog.\n\nThe application of AI to security software at the Enterprise level is a huge untapped opportunity. The point here is relatively simple: Hardware firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) represent the greatest AI investments so far. The implementation of that hardware will create new opportunities for software as AI matures. Datadog is well positioned in that sense.\n\nThe company is also growing rapidly and is expected to experience massive EPS growth during this fiscal year. In short, there\u2019s a lot to like about Datadog.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Good morning. More CFOs are stepping into the CEO role. But it\u2019s not always a direct path. And sometimes, CFOs may even have to pitch themselves as fit for the chief executive seat.\n\nThat was the case for John Fieldly, CEO, and chairman of Celsius Holdings, an energy drink company founded in 2004. \u201cWhen I took over Celsius as the CEO, we did $36 million in total revenue for the year,\u201d Fieldly told Fortune\u2019s Audience Team in a recent video interview. \u201cAnd just now in 2023, we did $1.3 billion.\u201d\n\nCelsius is a caffeine-fueled energy drink that is said to burn calories\u2014up to 140 calories per bottle consumed, the company claims. Celsius has over a 10% share of the energy-drink category and is growing, Fieldly said. Over just the past year-and-a-half, the business has doubled in size. And in the past five years, shares are up 6,290%.\n\nHe joined Celsius as CFO in 2012 to work with Gerry David, CEO at the time. \u201cIt was risky to get a job as a CFO when I was 32 years old,\u201d Fieldly recalled. \u201cI had to go for it. Those opportunities only come once in a blue moon.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, when David decided to retire, Fieldly began serving in the dual role of interim CEO and CFO. While working in both roles, Celsius went public on NASDAQ under the ticker CELH.\n\n\u201cThe company was looking for a CEO at the time,\u201d Fieldly explained. \u201cThey actually went through a variety of interviews. I was, I guess, younger than who they were looking for. But with hard work, drive and passion, I really rallied around the team and continued to grow the business.\u201d\n\nAfter the company\u2019s third attempt for a CEO hire, \u201cI told Gerry I wanted in on the interview process, and I could run this company,\u201d he said. The board included Fieldly in the interview process, and he was ultimately selected as CEO in 2018.\n\nFieldly shared his pitch to be considered for the CEO role: \u201cPerformance, drive, passion, execution. Look at what was accomplished over a year and a half\u2014it was pretty much flawless execution. You couldn\u2019t deny what was built when I was CEO and CFO. Uplisted in NASDAQ. Made all the investors whole, on the original thesis that I joined the company on. And I knew I could take this company even further.\u201d\n\nWhat did his CEO job interview look like? He told Fortune: \u201cI did a whole presentation on PowerPoint. I talked about the targeted consumer, and how we\u2019re going to tactically approach them to create daily loyalty and connect with them throughout their daily lifestyle.\u201d\n\nFieldly advises that if you\u2019re a CFO with goals for the CEO seat, you have to be proactive. \u201cI think you\u2019ve always got to be selling yourself, each and every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe opportunity was there. I had to jump on it.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy With $1,000 or You\u2019ll Be Kicking Yourself in 2025",
        "content": "The broader market rally has left many investors wondering if there are any growth stocks to buy before a correction. I believe that there absolutely are. Despite the run-up, a number of high-potential growth stocks remain undervalued. Their fundamentals have only gotten stronger.\n\nI believe these stocks are poised for a major bounce-back over the next 12 months. Several have already begun to recover. Now may be the time to establish a position before they really take off.\n\nInvesting just $1,000 across these picks could generate market-beating returns. A few even have the potential to become multi-baggers. That means a relatively small investment today might lead to very sizable gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are seven to look into:\n\nBombardier (BDRBF) BOMBARDIER sign is seen during the 12th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, also known as Airshow China 2018. BDRBD stock\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nBombardier (OTCMKTS:BDRBF) designs and manufactures business jets for corporations, governments, and wealthy individuals. The Canadian aerospace company has been on a roll lately, with its stock price surging over 78% so far in 2024. I believe Bombardier is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing boom in private aviation and increased defense spending.\n\nIn the first quarter, Bombardier grew its order backlog to $14.9 billion. The company also expanded margins and is on track to deliver 150-155 aircraft this year, up from 138 in 2023. Bombardier\u2019s high-margin aftermarket service revenues jumped 13% year-over-year in Q1.\n\nAnalysts are quite bullish on the stock, with 8 out of 11 rating it a \u201cBuy.\u201d I personally believe that this stock could cross $100.\n\nLast week, Bombardier reached a new 3-year labor deal with its union, ending an 18-day strike. The company is also doing its part for the environment, installing thousands of solar panels to slash emissions at its London service center. Thus, the company looks poised to hit its 2025 targets of $9 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion in EBITDA, making it among the best growth stocks to buy.\n\nPaysign (PAYS) An image of two cellphones with coins flying from one screen into the other. Fintech Growth Stocks\n\nSource: kentoh/Shutterstock\n\nPaysign (NASDAQ:PAYS) is a leading provider of prepaid card programs and integrated payment processing solutions. The company has been making waves lately with impressive financial results and a promising growth trajectory. In the first quarter of 2024, Paysign\u2019s revenue surged 30% year-over-year to $13.2 million, beating analyst estimates. Net income turned positive at $309,000, a significant improvement from the net loss in the same period last year.\n\nI believe Paysign is well-positioned to capitalize on the megatrend of digital payments and the tailwinds of increasing healthcare spending. The company\u2019s focus on the healthcare industry, particularly its rapidly expanding patient affordability business, sets it apart. It has a pipeline of new programs and partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies. As such, I\u2019m not surprised to see that Paysign\u2019s patient affordability revenue skyrocketed by 305% in Q1 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Paysign\u2019s prospects. The stock is rated a strong buy with a 21% upside potential. As interest rate cuts take effect and transaction volumes rise, I expect Paysign\u2019s growth to accelerate further.\n\nIAC (IAC) The logo for IAC is seen at the top of an office building.\n\nSource: Black Pebble / Shutterstock.com\n\nIAC (NASDAQ:IAC) is a media and internet company that owns brands like Dotdash Meredith, Care.com, and Angi. It also just inked a deal with OpenAI to license Dotdash Meredith\u2019s trusted content like People, Food & Wine, and Better Homes & Gardens. This partnership should translate into high-margin profits as OpenAI pays IAC for the rights to enhance its AI models with this premium content.\n\nIn Q1 2024, IAC beat earnings estimates with earnings per share of -34 cents vs the -76 cents expected, though revenue of $929.68 million slightly missed estimates. Analysts seem to agree that IAC is on the right track, with TD Cowen reiterating a buy rating and a $78 price target, viewing IAC as significantly undervalued. Improving EPS should send the stock higher, even if revenue stays sluggish. Growth Stocks: IAC financial estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe upside potential looks compelling if IAC can deliver on the promise of its OpenAI deal and other initiatives. Count me optimistic on IAC\u2019s prospects to ride the AI megatrend to new heights in the category of growth stocks to buy.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) sells functional energy drinks and liquid supplements. The stock has plummeted nearly 50% from its 2024 highs amid concerns about slowing growth and high valuation.\n\nI believe this selloff is overdone and presents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors. Celsius is well-positioned to capitalize on the megatrends of health and wellness, functional beverages, and fitness. The company reported record Q1 revenue of $355.7 million, up 37% year-over-year, and expects to benefit from expanded distribution through its PepsiCo partnership.\n\nAnalysts forecast Celsius\u2019 earnings per share to double over the next two years, with sales projected to increase around 30% annually through 2026. If Celsius can execute on these growth targets while riding the tailwinds of its key market trends, I see significant upside potential for the stock to bounce back strongly in the coming years. The recent dip looks like an attractive entry point for investors willing to hold through any near-term volatility. The analyst price target is also very bullish for a company of this size. CELH price target\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnd I can understand why: CELH financial estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nOf course, risks remain. But for those who believe in Celsius\u2019 long-term story, now may be the time to take a swig of this beaten-down beverage stock.\n\nSea Limited (SE) The logo for Sea Limited is seen on a web browser through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSea Limited (NYSE:SE) is a tech conglomerate that operates in Southeast Asia. I\u2019ve been bullish on this company for around a year now, and I\u2019m pleased to see the stock making some positive moves recently. In Q1 2024, Sea posted a strong 23% year-over-year revenue growth to $3.7 billion, though it did report a net loss of $23 million. The company\u2019s e-commerce arm, Shopee, achieved record high orders, GMV, and revenue, while its SeaMoney financial services business saw significant user growth. Sea\u2019s gaming unit Garena also rebounded, with its Free Fire game being the most downloaded mobile game globally in Q1.\n\nI believe Sea remains well-positioned to be the \u201cAmazon of Southeast Asia\u201d with its strong market presence in the region\u2019s fast-growing economies. Analysts are optimistic, projecting EPS to jump from $2 in 2024 to $5.65 in 2026, along with sustained double-digit revenue growth. While there may be short-term fluctuations, the long-term prospects for Sea look bright as it rides the tailwinds of e-commerce and gaming growth in Southeast Asia and is one of the best growth stocks to buy in the region.\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (DRCT) Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept. digital ad stocks\n\nSource: weedezign via Shutterstock\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:DRCT) operates an advertising and marketing technology platform. The company\u2019s stock has plunged nearly 87% since peaking in March, but I believe it may have bottomed out near its historical resistance level. At current prices, the potential upside outweighs the downside risk.\n\nAnalysts expect margins to expand swiftly, with EPS rising from 26 cents this year to 41 cents next year, accompanied by double-digit revenue growth. The company recently announced partnerships with Amazon Publisher Services and HPE GreenLake, which should attract more demand to its Colossus SSP platform and boost performance. Rate cuts could also boost earnings significantly due to its interest expenses being high. How Direct Digital Holdings Makes Its Money\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThese positive catalysts make me believe Direct Digital Holdings could soar once again over the next year. The digital advertising megatrend provides a strong tailwind. And with its shares trading at a fraction of their March high, now may be an opportune time for risk-tolerant investors to start a position.\n\nATRenew (RERE) A concept image of mobile payment with a smart phone for a cup of coffee.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nATRenew (NYSE:RERE) operates the largest pre-owned consumer electronics transactions and services platform in China. The company has been making strides lately, with total revenues growing 27.1% year-over-year to RMB3.65 billion in Q1 2024 and non-GAAP operating income reaching RMB80.2 million. I believe ATRenew\u2019s stock\u2014which has traded between $1-$3 for the past two years\u2014is primed for a breakout in the next 12 months as fundamentals continue to improve.\n\nManagement is optimistic about future growth, citing increasing recycling opportunities driven by government action plans and rising demand for used products in China.\n\nPartnerships with major players like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are fueling ATRenew\u2019s product revenue growth. The company\u2019s multi-category recycling business is also taking off, with transaction value quadrupling year-over-year in Q1. Analysts seem bullish, too \u2013 Zacks recently introduced 2024 and 2025 adjusted EPS estimates of 25 cents and 38 cents for ATRenew, implying 90% growth this year and 50%+ next year.\n\nWith RMB2.6 billion in cash, a share buyback program underway, and potential dividends on the horizon, I think ATRenew trades well-positioned among growth stocks to buy in order to ride the tailwinds of China\u2019s push toward a circular economy in the coming years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks That Could Skyrocket in the Back Half of 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Lululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU) and Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) are two consumer brands that have become wildly popular over the years. Both stocks have been on great runs the past several years, although both have had large sell-offs this year.\n\nLet's look at why these stocks have sold off and why they could both be poised to see major rebounds in the second half of this year and beyond.\n\n1. Celsius Holdings\n\nEnergy drink maker Celsius had been on a massive run the past five years, until about late May. Now the beverage stock suddenly finds its share price cut nearly in half from its all-time highs.\n\nThe company's success stems from carving out an attractive niche in the energy drink market by appealing to customers with a less aggressive aesthetic: differentiated flavors such as Peach Vibe, no-sugar options in a high-sugar category, slimmed-down cans, and a toned-down marketing message. A distribution deal with PepsiCo in 2022, meanwhile, gained the company widespread distribution across retailers, especially in the important convenience store channel.\n\nHowever, after three consecutive years of 100% or more revenue growth, that growth has unsurprisingly begun to slow. The company is now essentially fully distributed in the U.S. First-quarter revenue growth of 37% was strong, but ultimately a huge deceleration from the 95% sales growth it was in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Nielsen data in tracked channels has shown growth continuing to slow week after week, down to 13% the last week of June, although the comparison was affected by the timing of the July 4 holiday. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDespite its slowing growth in tracked channels, Celsius still has a number of opportunities in front of it that could help the stock rebound this year and beyond. International growth remains a big opportunity for the company. It's just barely scratching the service in terms of penetration, as it has just entered markets in the U.K. and Australia. It also has an opportunity for increasing items per store, better cooler placement, and growing in non-tracked channels.\n\nTrading at under 35 times 2025 earnings estimates and with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1 times, the stock looks attractively valued for a growth stock that still has a number of good opportunities ahead of it. If the company can expand internationally and gain a similar niche to what it has in the U.S., the stock should perform well over the long term. CELH PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\n2. Lululemon Athletica\n\nLululemon's stock has had a difficult year, with shares down over 40% year to date. Investors have been nervous about increased competition from the likes of upstarts such as Alo and Vuori, as well as potential fashion shifts. Cautious commentary about the U.S. consumer in March when it reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results, combined with its chief product officer leaving in May, only added fuel to the fire.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter, the company saw flat U.S. same-store sales, but a 29% jump in international same-store sales led to a 7% overall increase in same-store sales and a 10% overall increase in revenue.\n\nInternational remains one of the biggest opportunities for Lululemon moving forward, and so far it appears the brand is resonating with international customers. However, the company also has the ability to reinvigorate growth in its North American markets through product innovation and category expansion.\n\nThe brand appears to remain strong, and the potential of an improved U.S. consumer and strong back-to-school season could also bode well for growth. Early indications are that the back-to-school shopping season is off to a good start, with Adobe Analysts noting that Amazon saw its Prime Day revenue for kids' apparel soar 165%, while other back-to-school items like backpacks and school supplies were up 216%. Other data points from the National Federation of Retailers, including May containership volumes and strong June retail, also point to a strengthening retail environment.\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 18 based on 2025 estimates, Lululemon is trading at one of the cheapest valuations in its history. LULU PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nGiven its valuation, the opportunities in front of it, and the potential for a strong back-to-school shopping season, the apparel stock could be set up to see a strong rebound in the back half of this year and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "On July 16, CNBC reported, \u201cSmall-cap stocks are on a tear right now.\u201d The financial news channel\u2019s website noted that, during the preceding week, the category became the market leader, at least temporarily. Indeed, the Russell 2000 index, made up of small-cap names, hit its highest level since January 2022 on July 16. With most on the Street betting that the Federal Reserve will start an interest rate-cutting cycle in September, many large investors are anxious to get more exposure to small-cap stocks. That\u2019s because those names, due to the fact that many lose money and have high debt loads, are seen as among the biggest beneficiaries of lower rates.\n\nAlso importantly, Joshua Brown, the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and a CNBC commentator, recently said on the channel that the rally of small-cap stocks could last a month. But since the rate-cut cycle will likely last many months and a high percentage of small-cap names have been beaten down tremendously, I think the surge could easily last until the end of this year. With that said, here are three Russell 2000 stocks to buy now.\n\nLithia Motors (LAD) Lithia Motors Retail company logo seen displayed on smart phone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAuto retailer Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD) should get a big boost from the Fed\u2019s upcoming interest rate cuts. That\u2019s because most consumers borrow money in order to purchase vehicles, so lower rates make it much more affordable for them to buy automobiles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLithia\u2019s business is already growing rapidly, as its top line surged 23% last quarter, versus the same period a year earlier, to an all-time record of $8.6 billion. Further, the retailer\u2019s new vehicle same-store units handed over rose by an impressive 3.6% year-over-year.\n\nLithia\u2019s operating income dropped significantly, coming in at $348.1 million from $373.2 million in Q1 of 2023. However, the interest rate cuts should enable the company to meaningfully lift its prices, significantly raising its profitability.\n\nThe shares have a very low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10, and the company announced last month that it would increase its share buyback total by $350 million to $660 million.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) stock has tumbled in recent weeks because the Street is worried about the energy-drink maker\u2019s growth slowing. However, the firm\u2019s growth appears to be slowing, primarily because its distribution partner, PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), accumulated too much inventory of Celsius\u2019 beverages and has been working through that inventory in recent weeks. That should be a temporary issue since Celsius\u2019 growth is likely to reaccelerate once Pepsi has worked through its excess inventory.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, despite this issue, Celsius\u2019 top line still jumped by an impressive 37% in Q1 versus the same period a year earlier. Further, due to Celsius\u2019 low calorie count and the impressive amount of vitamins it provides compared to other energy drinks, I\u2019m confident it will deliver strong financial results in the medium and long term.\n\nAlso upbeat on CELH stock is investment bank William Blair. According to the bank, the beverage maker offered \u201ccompelling perspectives and proof points\u201d\u00a0on the long-term outlook of its business in May.\n\nGiven these points, I view the name as one of the best Russell 2000 stocks to buy now.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) has been getting big lifts from the surging popularity of its HOKA and UGG footwear.\n\nIn its fiscal Q4 that ended in March, the company\u2019s top line jumped 21% versus the same period a year earlier to $960 million, while its income from operations soared to $144.26 million from $105.92 million in the same quarter a year earlier. Very impressively, the net sales of its HOKA footwear advanced 34% year-over-year to $533 million.\n\nIn the wake of Decker\u2019s financial results, investment bank Truist (NYSE:TFC) upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold. Truist believes the company is \u201cfiring on all cylinders\u201d and has plenty of growth opportunities going forward. Specifically, it expects Deckers to gain more market share than the Street expects and predicts that UGG will become more popular overseas. Truist believes the brand will gain momentum as awareness among consumers about its new sneakers and sandals grows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in CELH.

        "title": "Celsius Stock Has Plunged Nearly 50% From 2024 Highs. Here's What Happened to Monster Beverage Stock When the Same Thing Happened in 2012.",
        "content": "Energy drink company Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) was the belle of the stock market ball in recent years. From the start of 2019 through the end of 2023, shares were up more than 4,600%, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $470,000. But in 2024, Celsius stock is down about 4%, and it's down 45% from this year's highs.\n\nThis isn't just a case of stock market volatility. On the contrary, investors are digesting multiple headline issues that paint a bearish picture for the outlook of Celsius' business.\n\nFor starters, investors are looking at sales data that shows slowing growth. Investors already know that growth for Celsius is slowing -- revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was only up 37% year over year, compared to 95% growth in the prior-year period. But investors and analysts who monitor sales trends for the industry believe growth is slowing even further, prompting some analyst to lower price targets for Celsius stock.\n\nThere are also health-related concerns with Celsius making the rounds on social media. Many investors are starting to believe that there are health risks with energy drinks. They also think that people are becoming more aware of the risks and have consequently cut the products from their shopping routines.\n\nMany readers are likely too young to remember what was happening with the stock market in 2012. But some of us (ahem, me) are old enough to remember a very similar situation with Monster Beverage(NASDAQ: MNST). Here's what happened back then and how it could apply to Celsius' shareholders today.\n\nWhen Monster stock crashed hard\n\nIn the decade leading up to 2012, Monster stock was one of the greatest investments of all time. I'm not exaggerating. If you had invested $10,000 in Monster stock at the start of 2002, you would have had $1.76 million at the start of 2012. In short, growth was extraordinary and investors were rewarded.\n\nBut 2012 brought something different for Monster's shareholders. The headlines were chock-full of stories regarding the danger of sugar. As an example, New York City's then-mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed portion controls on sugary drinks that year -- it was a big deal.\n\nThe headlines also bombarded investors with stories about the dangers of energy drinks, not unlike today with Celsius.\n\nDon't misunderstand: Sales for Monster did slow to a crawl as a result of these things. Many investors thought that this stock's magnificent run was over. As they moved on from their positions in Monster, shares fell 48% from its 2012 highs.\n\nStory continues MNST Chart\n\nThe 2012 low for Monster stock came during the last week of October, and it was a great time to buy, even though bearish sentiment was reaching a fever pitch. Since then, Monster stock is up more than 600%, compared with just a 300% return for the S&P 500.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Celsius?\n\nReturns for Monster stock in 2012 and returns for Celsius stock in 2024 illustrate an important investing truth: Over short time periods, feelings can influence returns. As the news cycle turned bearish on both companies, both stocks fell.\n\nHowever, with Monster, the news cycle couldn't keep the stock down because the business results lifted it back up. Over the last 10 years, the company's revenue has tripled, and earnings per share (EPS) have nearly quadrupled. It's hard to keep a stock down when that's the case.\n\nFor Celsius, the questions investors should ask are whether it's poised for more growth and whether it can do it profitably. If it can, then investors may have completely forgotten what they were worried about in 2024 by the time 2034 rolls around.\n\nOne thing that Celsius has in its favor is a strong relationship with PepsiCo, one of the largest consumer-packaged goods companies in the world. Pepsi doesn't just help with distribution --it also has an equity stake. It's good to have a powerful ally in a competitive space.\n\nAnother thing in Celsius' favor for the long term is its relatively small size. It's grown by leaps and bounds in recent years. But with annual revenues only recently crossing $1 billion, it still has plenty of upside potential.\u00a0 For perspective, Monster generates over $7 billion in annual revenue.\n\nThe good thing here is that Celsius has focused on growth over optimal profitability. But now that growth has slowed, it can make some operational improvements to maximize higher profits. Therefore, there's a chance for higher revenues and profits.\n\nI'm not saying that there aren't any concerns ahead for Celsius. Investors will want to monitor sales and the public perception of its products. But more often than not, investors overreact in the short term, which creates great opportunities for those with a long-term mindset.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "title": "Should You Invest in Celsius (CELH) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nCelsius currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy, representing 81.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CELH Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CELH\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Celsius here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Celsius, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in CELH?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Celsius, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 2.4% over the past month to $1.06.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Celsius. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Celsius with a grain of salt.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We believe Celsius' product portfolio appeals to a broad demographic, creating new consumers and generating more frequent usage occasions in the energy drink category. As a result, Celsius has been able to grow sales through market share gains and market expansion. Furthermore, the company signed a US distribution partnership with PepsiCo in October 2022, expanding its distribution and increasing penetration wherever it\u2019s already sold. Shares sold off due to Pepsi selling down elevated inventory and recent data indicating broader weakness within the energy drink category. We will monitor US category trends, but the company continues to capture market share and expand margins. Meanwhile, there remains a large opportunity for international expansion.

        "title": "How the Celsius CEO turned a cult-favorite energy drink into a stock-market lightning rod with 6,000% growth",
        "content": "John Fieldly, 44, is revved up.\n\nThe CPA-turned-energy-drink evangelist is the president, CEO, and chairman of Celsius Holdings, the ubiquitous energy drink known for its proclaimed calorie-burning abilities\u2014up to 140 calories per bottle consumed, the company claims. If that weren\u2019t enough to endear itself to gym rats, it also comes in over 30 zany flavors like kiwi-guava.\n\nIf you ask Fieldly, who joined the company amid its turnaround efforts in 2012 as its CFO, Celsius was \u201cborn in gyms and health clubs\u201d and is today now positioned for broad, mass appeal\u2014especially among today's \u201chealth-minded consumers.\u201d (Which is to say\u2014pretty much everyone.)\n\nFieldly, who graduated college via night classes and daytime work at a drug manufacturer, worked as a CPA before making the leap. At the time, Celsius was in dire straits. It had listed, then delisted, on NASDAQ, its products were removed from shelves, and investors considered it to be a penny stock.\n\nFieldly, at the time, thought his days\u2014and those of the company\u2014were numbered. But those 12 employees back in 2012 have become nearly 800. The business has doubled in size over just the past year-and-a-half. And that stock price? Over the past five years, shares are up 6,290%.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, the brand\u2019s CEO reveals his own origin story, the energy drink\u2019s comeback, his secrets to success, and where he sees the ubiquitous beverage going next.\n\nThe following transcript has been lightly condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWhat\u2019s your background?\n\nI was born in Newburgh, New York, but really grew up north of Tampa, Florida, in a town called Pasco County. I always aspired to work for a public company. I remember coming down to Manhattan with my grandmother to go to the New York Stock Exchange. I was fascinated by Wall Street, and in high school and college, I wanted to be involved in finance. So I got my CPA license, and actually got a job as a staff accountant. That was at a company based up here on Park Avenue called Lebhar-Friedman, in the B2B publishing industry.\n\nI got to learn about B2B publishing, events and periodicals, and really the finances behind that\u2014as well as production and sales. I briefly worked for a publicly traded biotech company; that's when I had the opportunity to really work on some SEC filings, which I was really excited about.\n\nI joined Celsius over 13 years ago, back in 2012, and it's been an amazing journey. I started off as their CFO, part of our original turnaround team.\n\nWhat was your very first job?\n\nWhen I was 13, I tried to start a lawn-mowing business, because in Florida, grass grows like crazy. It was not successful. So my first job was at a carwash at 14, trying to save money to buy my first car. I still enjoy washing cars today; it's part of my relaxation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut probably the biggest education I got that still benefits me today came from my eight years working at Eckerd Drugs. I started off in customer service and worked my way up to assistant manager. That experience really benefits me at Celsius, as well really helping me understand the path to purchase with shoppers.\n\nAt Eckerd, I was part of a turnaround team that helped rebuild underperforming stores. I did that all through college while I was attending the University of South Florida. That taught me a lot about consumers, their purchasing patterns, how to upsell at retail, demographics, and making sure you have the right product in the right store\u2014as well as learning how to deal with people.\n\nThat's one thing, even today, when we're hiring employees at Celsius\u2014we're getting close to 800 employees these days\u2014we look for retail experience on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\n\nAt first, when I was at USF, I was in night school, because I worked during the day. I originally had an accounting professor, when I took accounting during the summer, who always came to class in Jimmy Buffett T-shirts and shorts. He said he was towing a boat in his backyard to go fishing right after class. He did taxes down in Miami, taught at USF part-time, and then went fishing every day. Going through that class was quite interesting; he made accounting seem like a really good job, and he was really relaxed.\n\nThat got me more interested in getting my CPA license. I am a CPA, and I've never worked fewer than 60 hours a week. So it\u2019s a little bit different from the way he explained it. But I really enjoyed my time at USF. I enjoy finance, I really treat financial numbers as a different language. So that's one thing I did at Celsius as CFO, and even do today as the CEO: translating the financials and commercial actions to really drive the teams forward, and it\u2019s worked really well.\n\nI was working at Lebhar-Friedman during probably the one of the worst recessions in some time. We were really working on restructuring the teams, because our advertising revenue got cut in half. That was really interesting\u2014working with the financials and commercial teams to restructure and optimize. That's one thing that really gets me excited.\n\nHow many hours would you say you work a week?\n\nI don't know. It never ends. I try to take the weekends off with my family on Sundays. But right now, Celsius is really a global business, so you're kind of always on. Even when I was in college, I did the same. When you commit yourself, you\u2019ve got to really, fully commit yourself. So I guess that's in my DNA.\n\nWould you recommend people work while they're in school?\n\nI think you\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do.\n\nTell us about the origins of Celsius.\n\nIt was born in South Florida. It was created by scientists in the sports-nutrition industry. And what's interesting\u2014I didn't know this until I started at Celsius\u2014but Boca Raton, in South Florida, not only has an IBM research facility where the first PC was created, but it\u2019s also the birthplace of sports nutrition. Rexall Sundown, the first multivitamin company, was headquartered there. GNC has a research department down there, creating their sports-nutrition products. Herbalife is down there. Some of the largest sports-nutrition companies are located in South Florida.\n\nSo the people behind Celsius wanted to create a thermogenic beverage. At the time, there were tablets that created a negative-calorie effect. Celsius was originally created as the world's only negative-calorie drink. It\u2019s clinically proven to burn 100 to 140 calories. There's science behind the product\u2014over six clinical studies. That's really the foundation.\n\nUnfortunately, after Celsius was launched nationwide, Coke and Nestl\u00e9 tried to copy it, and created a product called Enviga. But it didn't work. Celsius publicly listed on NASDAQ [in 2010], and basically got delisted out of the country [in 2011 because it] just didn't connect with consumers. That's when I showed up, in 2012.\n\nI was really part of a turnaround story here. The original investor tried to sell the business, but couldn't find any buyers. All their investors lost their money in the company. One thing the main investor wanted to do was make everyone whole again. That was the main thesis.\n\nI was introduced to the company by a gentleman called Gerry David. I worked with him at a biotech company called Oragenics. He joined Celsius as the original turnaround CEO, and he wanted me to join him on the journey as his CFO. The goal was to get the company back listed on NASDAQ, it was an OTC Pink Sheet company\u2014more of a penny stock, really. The goal was to get it back on NASDAQ and to make all investors whole.\n\nWhen Gerry started, we basically got delisted out of all the retailers. It was a really troubled time. I probably only thought I had another six months or a year left at the company. It was really troubling. We were asking investors for payroll for the small team. But we were all fully committed; we knew we had a great product.\n\nCelsius had great reviews, even in the early days, and we started consuming the product ourselves. It's a really great energy drink; you don't feel any jitters or crashes. It's a nice elevation, and the product actually works. It's thermogenic. We knew we had something; we knew health and wellness trends would continue to grow. It was just trying to find our niche in the industry, and being able to scale and grow the business.\n\nWhen I started, we had about 12 employees\u2014a really small group. We're now getting close to 800. It's just amazing. We\u2019ve doubled the size of the business in the last 18 months.\n\nWhen you look back at that period, what was the number one area where Celsius had to improve?\n\nEverything, really. One area we needed to focus on was to not go broad and wide\u2014we needed to get super hyper-focused. That's one thing we really did as a team and as a company. We tried to target a consumer and create loyalty. Really, when you have a consumer product, you need to be part of a daily lifestyle and daily routine. So one thing we did was really try to understand who's drinking Celsius, and why. And then: How do we really build upon that to create a foundation?\n\nI remember, probably back in 2013, in one of our meetings, the goal was to fill a stadium up with daily consumers, which was about, at the time, a small stadium. 35,000 daily consumers. Almost half of the standard NFL stadium we wanted to fill with daily consumers. That would make the company profitable. So that was a big goal we had internally.\n\nTell us more about your turnaround strategy and headcount growth.\n\nIt's very difficult to recreate the Celsius story. It really started to turn around after COVID. When you look at the timeline, prior to 2020, the company was growing, probably around like 30% to 40%, which is great. But we really saw an uptick in sales during the pandemic. And that's really when we changed the strategy from being more scientific, to really being a fitness and lifestyle brand.\n\nThe liquid has to be more than the ingredients in the can. We really wanted Celsius to stand for a global iconic brand. We want Celsius to be like the Apple logo, or Starbucks logo, or the iconic Monster Energy claw. The turning point was really focusing on the overall brand and this fitness lifestyle that's really been able to connect with a broader consumer than ever before, versus when we were really going after more diet and sports nutrition angles.\n\nWe took the brand and really made it mainstream, and it's taken off. We've done a variety of different tactics and marketing strategies. And it's worked. Sampling has been really critical because we knew we had a great product but we needed sampling in the right locations. So we focused on first responders, nurses, firefighters, and police officers. We focused on social media through a variety of different influencers and platforms, from Snapchat and Instagram to TikTok. But we\u2019re still focusing on our core and fitness. We partner with Barry's Bootcamp and Gold's Gym and 24-Hour Fitness, but we\u2019re really positioning the company for a broad lifestyle position.\n\nHow much success comes from branding versus what\u2019s in the can?\n\nIt's really hard to differentiate. I think it has to go both ways. You\u2019ve got to have a great product that works. But then you also have to have that branding that connects with the consumer in a broader way.\n\nConsider Nike. The sneaker industry is really a commodity. But the value that people see within the Nike sneaker really shows you the value of the brand. Nike makes great sneakers, but they also have an amazing brand. They couldn't be that iconic without connecting with consumers in an emotional way. That's one thing we learned: We really need to connect with consumers in an emotional way to really resonate and create that daily loyalty and be more than the liquid in the can.\n\nHow did you transition from CFO to CEO?\n\nI transitioned from CFO to CEO in 2018. Gerry wound up retiring; I think the stress of travel and running a public company took a toll on him. So actually, for about a year and a half, I was the CFO and the CEO. And we actually uplisted to NASDAQ while I was doing both roles. The company was looking for a CEO at the time. They actually went through a variety of interviews. I was, I guess, younger than who they were looking for at the time, but for the hard work, drive and passion, I really rallied around the team and continued to grow the business.\n\nAfter the third attempt at a hire, I told Gerry I wanted in on the interview process, and I could run this company. So I got in the interview process. And I wandered over to CEO in 2018, officially, and I backfilled the CFO role.\n\nSounds like you pitched yourself. What did you say?\n\nI think you\u2019ve always got to be selling yourself, each and every day. Performance matters, right? Performance, drive, passion, execution. Look at what was accomplished over a year and a half\u2014it was pretty much flawless execution. You couldn't deny what was built when I was CEO and CFO. Uplisted in NASDAQ. Made all the investors whole, on the original thesis that I joined the company on. And I knew I could take this company even further.\n\nThey gave me the opportunity, so here we are today, over a 10% share of the energy-drink category. Actually, we just released earnings last quarter, and at 11.5% a share and growing. And the company couldn't be better-positioned, especially with today's health and wellness trends. And one day, we're going to be the number-one energy drink in the world.\n\nI took the job at Celsius as the CFO really to work with Gerry David, who brought me on. I had a small family over in Tampa. I had a daughter. It was risky to get a job as a CFO when I was 32 years old. It\u2019s very difficult for a public company. I say to my children all the time: There's forks in the road. Every decision you make brings you to another fork, I had an opportunity to get the job, and be a CFO of a publicly traded company, although small, micro-cap, I had to go for it. Those opportunities only come once in a blue moon. My favorite quote is from Abraham Lincoln: Things may come to those who wait, but only those things left by those who hustle. The opportunity was there. I had to jump on it.\n\nHow would you say you \u201cturned Celsius around\u201d?\n\nI was really focused on a disciplined approach. We continued to focus on core markets, financials, and our activation tactics. We control dollars and execution based on targeted consumer tactics in communities we're looking to activate.\n\nIt's a disciplined financial approach. We've been profitable since 2015. We have always focused on financial discipline. It\u2019s really difficult, in the beverage industry, to find success. There are over 1,000 new beverages that come to market every year. Fewer than 10% will make it to $100,000 in sales, and then maybe 10% of those will make it to a million dollars in sales. To get a brand to do a billion dollars in sales is nearly impossible. And that's something we achieved in 2023 which is just astonishing.\n\nWhen I took over Celsius as the CEO, we did $36 million in total revenue for the year. And just now in 2023, we did $1.3 billion.\n\nWhat did your CEO job interview look like?\n\nI did a whole presentation and had a whole PowerPoint. They really didn't have too many questions for me, to be honest with you, because they knew me. I was in there every quarter doing presentations. They knew the passion, they knew the drive, they weren't gonna find anyone that was more passionate than me.\n\nI think passion is so critical. You can really see when an individual wants to win, and I think they knew that. In my presentation, I talked about the consumer, the targeted consumer, and how we're going to tactically approach them to create daily loyalty, and connect with them throughout their daily lifestyle. When you're building a consumer product, you need to be part of a daily routine. And when you think about it, we're really all consumers, and we\u2019re all on a track. We go to the same grocery store, the same gym, maybe even the same restaurant once or twice a week.\n\nSaying \u2018I need to get you to pull off on exit 22\u2014when you never pull off on exit 22\u2014to try a new product\u2019 is extremely difficult, so you really have to have that mindset. When you think about the average consumer, how many new products do they try, or have they tried in the last week? I asked that question all the time, and most people say they haven\u2019t tried any new products. Then, when you find that one that actually says they tried a new product, or even tried a new product in the last month, ask them if they repurchased it\u2014that's even rarer. So it's really difficult.\n\nYou really have to have a tactical approach to be part of a daily lifestyle and daily routine. And that's the way you're going to build a really amazing, iconic brand.\n\nWhat in particular during the pandemic made the brand flourish?\n\nDuring COVID, we really wanted to support the communities that supported us. We\u2019re a really big part of the daily lifestyles of trainers, all around the country. During COVID, all the gyms were closed, so if you were a trainer, you didn't have any money. We started the Zoom workouts later on, and once we figured out how to do that, trainers didn't really have a social presence. So we used our social platforms on Instagram and did Workout Wednesdays and Workout Fridays, where we would invite trainers from some of our gyms that sold Celsius, and we\u2019d have them on for a workout and put money behind them and advertise them. We've really helped a lot of trainers expand their social reach. We taught them a variety of different social tactics as well. And that kickstarted their careers, too. I think connecting with those consumers in a really emotional way helped out our pickups.\n\nInstacart is also a great platform, with all these home deliveries. One thing we did, even before COVID, was partner with Instacart. And we actually were on a beta test during March 2020. We were one of the first products to actually sponsor the beverage aisle on Instacart. We were trying to be a first-mover advantage. When you think about it, it's an omni world. Consumers want it when they want it, how they want it. So we marketed heavily on a lot of these delivery apps.\n\nI think we got people thinking about fitness, living fit, living healthy, living life to the fullest. And then during COVID where basically, if you weren't thinking about fitness and thinking about what you were putting in your body\u2014if you watch the news\u2014you're pretty much going to die. So I think that helped us out. We're all about health and wellness and fitness, and Celsius is all about living fit.\n\nThen a year later, Pepsi took a $550 million stake in Celsius. How did that change your strategy?\n\nQuite frankly, it was a little bit nerve-wracking and scary, because we've had an extremely disciplined approach. We were focusing on core markets: New York City, Miami, Tampa, Boston, Southern California, LA, Dallas. We were very tactical in our approach to these markets.\n\nAnd when Pepsi invested in us, it was a great day, because we knew we would be able to compete with Red Bull and Monster. Because\u2014one thing with the beverage industry\u2014it's very difficult to get products on the shelf. It's like the chicken or the egg: You have to get a consumer that pools the product, but then you can't get the product on the shelf, because you don't have a distributor, and a distributor won\u2019t take you unless you have a consumer pool. So that's a whole other difficulty of being in the beverage industry.\n\nBut when Pepsi invested in us, it was a great day, but also a nervous day, because that means that the company needed to think about a national launch. And if you recall, I came here as part of a turnaround story, because the original team launched it as a national launch, which unfortunately didn't work. But they had great strategies, they just didn't resonate with consumers. So that was a little bit concerning that we were doing it again on a national launch.\n\nBut we're taking our tactical approach, and we've expanded to more markets. It's the best thing for the company, and the partnership with Pepsi couldn't be stronger. If you think about 800 Celsius employees, just think of all the Pepsi employees we have nationwide right now helping us sell Celsius and keeping it in stock. We wouldn't be here, as successful as we are today, without Pepsi.\n\nYou mentioned Monster and Red Bull. Which brands would you say are your biggest competitors?\n\nPre-Pepsi, we really wanted to be the number-one energy drink. But what's interesting, with the broad distribution of Pepsi, is that we've now expanded into food service. We're in some select Dunkin Donuts. We're in Jersey Mike's. Now we're entering a variety of different food service opportunities, like colleges and universities. Over 12% of our Pepsi revenue is food service. So I think we're going after the total beverage market now, with this great opportunity and new Celsius flavors.\n\nWe want to be the most refreshing beverage in the world. The teams do an amazing job leveraging that refreshing flavor profile. I think we're really well-positioned to go after [the] total beverage [market].\n\nIf you were to sum it up in one sentence, what is Celsius\u2019s secret to success?\n\nConnecting with consumers in a meaningful way about living fit, living life to the fullest, and accomplishing your health and wellness goals. That's been the DNA of the brand\u2019s original thesis from the beginning. Today, with the health and wellness trends like they are, everyone wants better-for-you ingredients without sacrificing flavor. Consumers want more function in the foods they consume, and Celsius delivers on that. Fitness is hip, cool, sexy, premium, and connects with a broader consumer than ever before.\n\nWhat is your big goal for Celsius? Do you want to be a Fortune 500 company?\n\nAbsolutely we want to be a Fortune 500 company; that would be amazing. In 2023, we achieved $1.3 billion in sales. The company has been growing rapidly; it's just a matter of time. Our true targeted consumer these days is 18 to 24 years old. We really target college students\u2014the next generation in the energy category. The latest data shows Celsius driving the category growth by over 47% today.\n\nShould people under 18 not drink Celsius?\n\nWe don't promote the product to anyone under 18. It's got 200 milligrams of caffeine, which is less than a Starbucks coffee, or some of the coffee houses around here. But it's for 18 to 24. And actually, we have a lot of older demographics that consume Celsius because of the ingredients\u2014we have over seven essential vitamins.\n\nDoes it concern you at all that TikTok influencers are promoting these energy drinks to younger children?\n\nYeah, I mean, younger children shouldn't be drinking energy drinks. We're really marketed as a fitness beverage. So it's more of a pre-workout. That's where we're rooted, in gyms and health clubs. I know there are a lot of energy drinks out there that are mixing it with candy flavors, like Skittles, and I don't think that's appropriate.\n\nDo you drink Celsius every day?\n\nI do drink Celsius every day. About two cans a day.\n\nYou've been with Celsius for 12 years, that means you've had about 9,000 cans in your lifetime. Does that number concern you?\n\nNot at all. I still love the product. It\u2019s really refreshing. Many more to come. My favorite flavor\u2014I\u2019ve got to go old school\u2014is orange. Orange is one of the original flavors. It is phenomenal. But the teams have been coming out with some amazing flavors lately, like green apple cherry and sparkling fruit punch.\n\nPart of the secret sauce of Celsius is our use of cross-functional teams. We bring all the team groups together with ideas. We asked our employees what flavor trends they're seeing, and what flavors they\u2019d like to see with Celsius. So that's one thing we get the whole company involved in.\n\nOur Tropical Vibe flavor, which is a phenomenal starfruit and pineapple, was thought of by one of our employees. We had a meeting planned just to talk about new flavors, and everyone had to come with ideas. Someone went for a walk the day before and stumbled upon a starfruit tree, so they brought the starfruit into the office for the meeting. And then we started strategizing what other flavors pair well with a starfruit. So that's how we created Tropical Vibe.\n\nWere there any flavors that didn't make it out of the testing stages?\n\nWe launched flavors that we wound up discontinuing. We've tried a variety of different combinations and flavors. We tried a root beer flavor once, which doesn't really go with the brand. We've tried all different ideas, and some of them we just do because employees like to come up with different flavors. So we'll go ahead and make the prototype just for employees to try and have fun with it.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Celsius Holdings Stock Crashed 10% on Monday",
        "content": "Earnings season is upon us, and up on Wall Street analysts are placing their bets for who will beat -- and who will disappoint investors this quarter. That's apparently bad news for investors in Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH). This morning, TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow warned investors to lower their expectations for the energy drink maker, and cut his price target by 20%, to $68 a share.\n\nCelsius stock is down 10.7% in response as of noon ET.\n\nWhat TD Cowen said about Celsius\n\nWhat's the matter with Celsius, the business? Nothing really, according to Cowen. Rather, the problem is with investors who've gotten too excited over Celsius' prospects in an economy that's seeing more cautious consumer spending. As the analyst reminds, Pepsico just finished reporting disappointing second-quarter earnings, in which the only sales growth came from price increases, and sales volumes grew not at all.\n\nThis doesn't bode well for other drink makers like Celsius. Moskow notes that sales are continuing to slow, and warns today in a note covered on The Fly that \"consensus estimates for FY24 and FY25 sales are too high given the continued deceleration in sales growth.\" If he's right about that, it means profit projections are probably too high as well -- and also, predictions of how high Celsius stock will fly.\n\nIs Celsius stock a buy?\n\nWe'll have to wait until Celsius reports earnings early next month to find out whether Moskow is correct, of course. But already things are not looking great. Most analysts forecast that Celsius will earn $1.08 per share this year, implying a current-year P/E of 48 on the stock. That's pretty expensive given consensus forecasts of 22% sales growth this year. And if Celsius misses estimates, it will mean the stock is even more expensive than it already looks.\n\nHow much might Celsius end up costing? 50 times earnings? 55? And on an even slower growth rate? I have to admit, those valuations don't look great to me. Investors selling Celsius stock today may be making the right call.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Will Celsius (CELH) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH), which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry.\n\nThis company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 20.63%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Celsius was expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share, but it reported $0.27 per share instead, representing a surprise of 35%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.16 per share, while it actually produced $0.17 per share, a surprise of 6.25%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Celsius. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nCelsius currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.99%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Stocks to Watch: 7 Under-the-Radar Companies Quietly Building Empires",
        "content": "There are many under-the-radar stocks quietly building empires that stock investors should know about. These are the types of relatively unknown firms that create wealth for investors. However, as a result of being unknown, most investors have no idea of their virtues.\n\nA few of the names discussed below are somewhat well-known but none are household names in my mind. Each of these firms offers investors a lot to like and by getting in early the same investors can profit handsomely.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the biggest company names today were all once under-the-radar stocks as unknown companies brimming with potential. We\u2019re really talking about the essence of bargain hunting in the stock market. I believe every investor wants to find hidden gems before the broader market does. There\u2019s something about being able to say you invested in a company before it blew up that he\u2019s appealing to everyone. Let\u2019s look at several companies that currently exhibit that potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is an emerging energy drink company that has garnered some attention but remains unknown at the same time. While many consumers are familiar with the brand it is not a household name by any means.\n\nIt is however a company that continues to quietly build an energy drink empire. The stock itself had recently gotten very hot as many investors began to queue in on its growth and overall strong performance. It has also been very volatile in 2024 swinging between highs near $100 on two occasions and subsequently falling back into the $50s several times.\n\nThe most recent decline followed a research note from Morgan Stanley suggesting that Celsius would suffer a modest market share decline. Yet Celsius also saw revenues increase by nearly 36% during the first quarter while gross margin rose above 50%. Perhaps Celsius will suffer as more competitors enter the energy strength space but as it stands now, Celsius also benefits from strong pricing power based on those gross margins.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) Orange Ulta Beauty (ULTA) logo on storefront\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is an interesting potential choice among under-the-radar stocks. The stock itself has performed extraordinarily well over the past 5 years only to suffer more recently.\n\nThe reason is fairly straightforward: Ulta Beauty operates in a growing high-value beauty segment full of competition. Increased competition has forced the company to Revise its full-year forecast down slightly. That said, Ulta Beauty continues to deliver strong earnings that outpaced analyst expectations in the most recent quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Ulta Beauty is debt-free and has a $1 billion share buyback program that should deliver shareholder value moving forward. The point here is that although Ulta Beauty operates within a tough beauty sector and faces stiff competition outwardly, the company is still well run. That suggests to me that Ulta Beauty can rebound and deliver returns to investors while continuing to build its empire. Don\u2019t underestimate the fact that Ulta Beauty is debt-free. Being debt-free allows the company all sorts of latitude that other competitors don\u2019t enjoy.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK) is a stock and company that a lot of people will be entirely unfamiliar with. By simply looking at its name alone one might guess that the company sells camping goods or maybe even decks for houses.\n\nIt\u2019s actually a footwear company and owns both the UGGs and Hoka brands. The company owns other Footwear Brands but it is UGGs and Hoka that are propelling the company\u2019s empire forward. Sales of those two brands accounted for nearly $900 million in revenues in the fourth quarter alone. The company reported a record $4.2 billion in revenues for the full fiscal year 2023. Gross margins rose above 56% from 50% prior. Earnings per share increased by 51% during the same period.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Corporation is very much unknown and strongly exemplifies what it is to be among under-the-radar stocks quietly building an empire. The strength of Hoka and UGGs should continue to benefit shareholders moving forward.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is something of a behind-the-scenes player in the semiconductor sector and a stock worth buying.\n\nThe company designs the CPUs, GPUs, and other chip components that remain vital to the semiconductor industry today. It then licenses that intellectual property to other chip companies which can customize to their specific needs. ARM also sells software that allows developers to customize its processors.\n\nBeing so heavily involved in the semiconductor sector of course means that Arm Holdings is an artificial intelligence play. That has also raised questions regarding its valuation which is currently close to a high target price. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the valuation concerns, instead focusing on the fact that the company is expected to provide 20% or greater top-line growth for the next several years while also drastically increasing earnings this year and into the future. Arm Holdings continues to be like other smart, under-the-radar stocks in the AI chip opportunity.\n\nCloudflare (NET) In this photo illustration a Cloudflare Inc (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) Is a popular stock choice in the growing cybersecurity sector. The company is quietly becoming one of the go-to choices for all things related to internet security.\n\nMoreover, NET is well known for all kinds of security-related services including the prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The company also stores website content on its servers located in more than 320 cities globally. Generally speaking, Cloudflare is becoming better known, especially in light of growing concerns around security and artificial intelligence. That provides the company with a strong opportunity to grow and improve fundamentally.\n\nThe company indeed looks to be hitting its stride from a fundamental perspective. historically, the company has not provided net earnings overall in any given fiscal year. that is expected to change in 2024 when earnings per share will swing from -55 cents to 64 cents. Earnings are expected to continue to improve while top-line growth approaches 30% over the next several years.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Man holding a mobile with PinDuoDuo (PDD) logo at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is one of the best under-the-radar e-commerce plays available to investors anywhere. The company owns the Chinese discount shopping app Pinduoduo and a growing Temu marketplace that is quickly becoming an empire.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, revenues more than doubled to the US dollar equivalent of $12.02 billion. Net income more than tripled, growing by 246% during the same period to $3.87 billion.\n\nYet PDD Holdings continues to be undervalued on broader fears related to the Chinese economy. While the Chinese economy is certainly facing its share of trouble it is obvious that the e-commerce sector continues to offer plenty of opportunities. PDD Holdings is very clearly capitalizing on that opportunity and makes a lot of sense at the moment.\n\nThe company also recently introduced a consignment model that pushes logistics costs onto merchants. That should serve to further boost earnings at the already thriving company.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) will continue to grow due to the versatility of its platform. In turn, its stock should continue to grow as the company builds its empire.\n\nRoblox is available for use on PCs, smartphones, tablets, and the Xbox. The creator content-driven platform offering millions of experiences is available to a broad user base. It appeals to developers who leverage that platform to create unique experiences hosted on the platform. Meanwhile, the platform also allows social experiences that drive engagement and appeal especially as life moves more online.\n\nRevenues at\u00a0 Roblox are expected to rise by 47% overall in 2024. Sales are expected to double between 2023 and 2026. The platform is undergoing a period of rapid growth. That growth is the primary reason to invest in the company which projects to continue to produce losses for the next several years. The other thing to note about Roblox is that there must be incredible experiences housed on the platform that have simply gone unnoticed to date. It\u2019s a treasure trove of experiences that could become popular moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Stocks That Could Turn $1,000 Into $5,000 by 2030",
        "content": "Although investors might gravitate to tech stocks hoping for outsize gains, many often overlook the growth in the consumer sector. Home Depot is one of the best-performing stocks in the history of the stock market, and more recently, consumer stocks such as Amazon have delivered enormous gains.\n\nToday's investors might want to find the next Home Depot or Amazon, but such discoveries remain elusive. Still, a few consumer stocks could turn a $1,000 investment into $5,000 or more by 2030. Those on the lookout for such stocks should consider Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) and Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH).\n\nDutch Bros\n\nOne obvious strategy is to look for a stock that could expand its customer base by fivefold in that time. Indeed, Dutch Bros could fit that description.\n\nThe specialty beverage company has stood out for its espresso and half-and-half-based Dutch Classics. It also sells teas, energy drinks, lemonades, smoothies, and other beverages.\n\nIt had 876 locations across 17 states as of the end of March. With its stated goal of having about 4,000 stores in the next 10 to 15 years, expansion alone should foster much of that fivefold growth in its share price.\n\nMoreover, despite competition from Starbucks, smaller chains, and countless independents, Dutch Bros is likely gaining organically. In the first quarter of 2024, same-shop sales rose 10%.\n\nAlso, since it added 160 shops during the previous year, revenue in the first quarter grew by 40% from a year earlier to $275 million. The company kept a lid on expenses, resulting in $7 million in first-quarter net income, versus the $4 million loss in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAfter a dramatic sell-off following its initial public offering, the stock is in recovery mode, rising 50% during the past year. With that, its 2.7 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio now exceeds Starbucks' at 2.3.\n\nBut unlike Starbucks, Dutch Bros still has yet to cover much of the country. As it continues its expansion, it could take this coffee stock higher by fivefold or more in the process.\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nAdmittedly, an energy drink maker like Celsius Holdings might seem like a missed opportunity. The stock is up nearly 25,000% during the past 10 years, supercharged by a partnership with PepsiCo.\n\nRevenue no longer grows by triple digits, and its market share has pulled back slightly, causing the beverage stock to fall in recent weeks. Given that change in sentiment, one might wonder if its rapid growth can continue.\n\nBut Celsius stands out among energy drinks by targeting health-conscious consumers. It emphasizes natural ingredients, avoiding high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, and artificial flavors or colors, and using guarana extract as its stimulant.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth also remains robust. Revenue in the first quarter was $356 million, up 36% yearly. Celsius also kept the cost of revenue growth in check, which helped first-quarter net income rise to $78 million, 89% more than a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts forecast a 28% revenue increase in 2024 and another 27% the year after. Although the revenue growth rate could slow gradually, total revenue should continue rising for the foreseeable future.\n\nLastly, despite a recent drop in the stock price, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9 is near multiyear lows. So it's likely that once investors realize Celsius is going to remain a fast-growth company, the combination of rapid revenue increases and a comparatively low valuation should make a fivefold rise in the share price over the next six years achievable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dutch Bros wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before They Soar By as Much as 100%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Stock splits are all the rage on Wall Street this year, as evidenced by the growing number of companies engaging in them. These maneuvers are usually only undertaken after years of strong financial and operating results have driven a company's stock price out of reach of some smaller investors. It's worth noting that while a stock split is merely a cosmetic change, it can make it easier for employees and other retail investors to buy shares, which is often the reason cited by management for performing one.\n\nMore important to investors, however, should be the results that precede a split. In general, strong businesses tend to continue their winning ways, providing investors with an ongoing incentive to buy the stocks. So let's take a look at three companies that have more upside ahead, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Highest price-target upside, 56%\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has long been the undisputed champion of the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering video games, cloud computing, and data centers. As a result, it was well positioned when generative artificial intelligence (AI) burst on the scene in early 2023 and propelled demand for its highest-end chips into the stratosphere.\n\nNvidia's GPUs can provide the computational horsepower necessary to train and run large and complex large language models and other AI systems -- and their sales are booming.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended April 28), Nvidia's revenue jumped 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, propelling its earnings per share (EPS) up 629% to $5.98. Chips used for AI had the biggest impact: Revenue from its data center segment -- which includes AI processors -- jumped by 427% to $22.6 billion.\n\nNvidia's recent 10-for-1 stock split has captivated the imagination of investors. Even after the stock has gained more than 200% over the past year (as of this writing), some on Wall Street remain incredibly upbeat. Among the Wall Street analysts covering the stock, Rosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann is the company's biggest bull, with a buy rating and $200 price target, which would amount to upside of 56% from Monday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst cites accelerating demand for AI chips and Nvidia's integrated software, which fuels its top-shelf performance. \"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability,\" Mosesmann wrote. This suggests that Nvidia's market cap will climb from its current level around $3 trillion to $5 trillion over the next year or so.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe's far from alone in his bullishness on Nvidia. Of the 57 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in June, 53 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nCelsius Holdings: Highest price-target upside, 75%\n\nCelsius Holdings' (NASDAQ: CELH) approach to energy drinks focuses on healthier alternatives, and it is carving out market share in a fast-growing and profitable niche. It has quickly ascended the ranks to become the third-largest energy drink brand and conducted a 3-for-1 stock split late last year following a long period of robust growth.\n\nFurthermore, while rivals Red Bull and Monster Beverage have struggled, Celsius has been stealing share -- it nabbed 47% of all growth in the energy drink category in the first quarter. Notably, over the past three years, even as the broader beverage industry has contracted, the energy drink category has continued to grow -- and Celsius has been driving that trend.\n\nIn the first quarter, revenue grew 37% year over year to $356 million, while diluted EPS soared by 108%. Celsius faces tougher comps this year as its sales more than doubled in 2023, the result of its partnership with PepsiCo. The beverage giant made a $550 million investment for an 8.5% stake in Celsius, and supercharged its distribution.\n\nOver the past month, the stock has shed 23% of its value on concerns about slowing growth. However, some on Wall Street view this slump as a buying opportunity. Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala maintains a buy rating and a $98 price target on the stock -- 75% higher than Monday's closing price. The analyst noted the slower growth is \"normal in year two of [a] national distribution\" agreement and recommends that investors disregard the \"near-term noise.\"\n\nSirius XM Holdings: Highest price-target upside, 100%\n\nSirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI) is the undisputed satellite radio leader in North America. It boasts 34 million paid subscribers and 150 million total listeners when including its ad-supported Pandora music streaming service -- an audience that's unmatched.\n\nThe macroeconomic headwinds of the past couple of years, including higher-than-usual inflation, have weighed on the stock, which is down 41% thus far in 2024. Furthermore, investors are having an unjustified knee-jerk reaction to Sirius XM's upcoming third-quarter merger with Liberty Sirius XM(NASDAQ: LSXMA), its tracking stock, and the resulting reverse stock split. While a reverse stock split is typically a sign of trouble, in this case, it's a necessary corporate action as part of the upcoming acquisition, which will bring all its shareholders under one \"roof.\"\n\nIn the first quarter, revenue climbed 1% year over year to $2.16 billion, while EPS jumped 17% to $0.07. Its improving metrics were fueled by record ad revenue, the result of an ongoing recovery in the broader advertising space. While its paid subscribership declined by nearly 2%, the impact of that was partially offset by an increase in average revenue per subscriber.\n\nIn the wake of the stock's 27% decline over the past year, some on Wall Street believe the selloff has gone too far. Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan leads the bull camp on Sirius XM, with a buy rating and a price target of $6.50 on the stock. That's 100% higher than Monday's closing price. Harrigan points to a market disconnect in advance of its upcoming merger with Liberty Sirius XM, as well as a \"gaggle of strategic initiatives\" undertaken by management as having the potential to drive growth.\n\nThis uncertainty has led to a similar disconnect between the business and its valuation. Sirius XM currently trades for less than 10 times earnings, a ratio that suggests almost no growth ahead. Yet the improving U.S. economy should boost Sirius XM's growth rate, which could act as a catalyst for a stock price rally.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Are Pepsico's Earnings Good News For Its Dividend Future?",
        "content": "Are Pepsico's Earnings Good News For Its Dividend Future?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nIf you are looking for a salty snack or a cool drink, you might have a PepsiCo product in your hand. The global beverages and snacks conglomerate has also provided plenty of refreshments for dividend investors. It is a dividend aristocrat with 53 years of consecutive dividend increases. It has a forward dividend yield of 3.31% and an annual dividend of $5.42. In the most recent quarter, it returned $8.2 billion to shareholders, $7.2 billion of that\u00a0 in dividends.\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nWhile it's unlikely that the dividend is in jeopardy, it's worth reviewing recent earnings to see what we can learn about where Pepsico's growth may come from next. The company delivered 13% earnings per share growth as it reduced its cost of sales, but organic growth was up by less than 2%, down sharply year over year.\n\nSnacking Less\n\nOne immediate concern is a weakness in North American convenience food purchases. The Frito-Lay North America division was down by 0.5%. The Quaker Oats division was down by 18%, much of that driven by the effect of a large recall of bars and other products. The company expects to meet rather than exceed a 4% revenue growth target for the full year.\n\nWith stratospheric inflation hopefully in the rearview mirror, it's unlikely that PepsiCo will need to, or be able to, increase prices significantly anytime soon. Like many other consumer goods companies, it has raised prices in recent quarters but now sees that snackers have scaled back their consumption of Frito-Lay products. The market was aware of this issue before the earnings release, and four analysts lowered their price targets for the stock\u2019s future in July alone.\n\nSome of this drop could merely be price sensitivity, but we can't rule out the potential for changes in behavior. On the earnings call, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said that the company has not seen a significant impact from the rapid adoption of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs but that it is something the company is monitoring.\n\nGiven that most of the adoption of these drugs is heavily concentrated in the U.S. and the decrease in the volume of Frito-Lay product sales appears to be occurring around the world, it is likely that something else is causing the decline in snacking. However, the company is paying more attention to permissible foods, such as brands like PopCorners and SunChips, which are perceived as healthier options.\n\nStory continues\n\nLaguarta stated that while plain potato and tortilla chips may need some price adjustments, new flavors are performing well. This indicates that pricing strategies and flavor development are key to snacking success.\n\nCan you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors.\n\nBeyond The Fizz\n\nLike Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), while Pepsi is the brand most associated with the company, its future growth is unlikely to come from it. The company is seeing large strides in functional water. Laguarta pointed out that both Gatorade and Propel are taking market share.\n\nBut don't rule out carbonated beverages yet. The expansion of the Mountain Dew brand into new flavors has resonated with consumers, and the company also plans to expand its zero-sugar offerings. Its partnership with Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) and its company brands in the space also expose it to the resilient energy drinks market.\n\nA Global Focus\n\nSpeaking to analysts, Laguarta noted that Pepsi's future remains an international story. The company has seen China's consumers be cautious about spending but still sees potential in that area. Net revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region was up 1% in the quarter. In Latin America, net revenue growth was up by 2%, driven by increased beverage volume. Europe remained strong, and the company's overall international organic net revenue growth was 7%. Laguarta is also looking to other emerging markets to find new customers.\n\nWhile Pepsico's quarter was not exactly what many investors hoped to see, the company clearly has a strategy to address the weakness in the snack foods division while powering forward with new beverage offerings.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "content": "Investors looking for stocks in the Food - Miscellaneous sector might want to consider either BRF (BRFS) or Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, BRF has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Celsius Holdings Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that BRFS's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nBRFS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.61, while CELH has a forward P/E of 52.14. We also note that BRFS has a PEG ratio of 0.34. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 1.61.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for BRFS is its P/B ratio of 1.37. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CELH has a P/B of 37.94.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, BRFS holds a Value grade of A, while CELH has a Value grade of D.\n\nBRFS stands above CELH thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that BRFS is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Buy-and-hold stocks don\u2019t have to be boring. Often, investors looking for buy-and-hold stocks see recommendations centered around what can be called charitably value traps. Alternately, some recommend buy-and-hold stocks based purely on recent outperformance without looking at long-term potential or whether the company is objectively overvalued.\n\nThese buy-and-hold stocks blend the best of both worlds, with recent winds, growth potential, and fundamental underpinnings creating a foundation suitable for any long-term portfolio. Don\u2019t let short-term fluctuations scare you away from their long-term potential, either. Some of these buy-and-hold stocks dropped slightly in recent months, but in all cases, solid tailwinds offer a compelling and viable investment thesis.\n\nRemember to do your own due diligence when finding buy-and-hold stocks, but this list is a strong starting point that captures multiple sectors, company sizes, and opportunities for a well-rounded portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) is often at the front of the line for buy-and-hold stocks; this list is no exception.\n\nThe conglomerate\u2019s diverse portfolio includes more than 50 companies across diversified and evergreen industries such as real estate, transportation, energy, and consumer goods. These expansive holdings offer an easy way to achieve a balanced investment portfolio without picking numerous individual stocks.\n\nAdditionally, investing in Berkshire Hathaway means aligning with Warren Buffett\u2019s value-first investment strategies. Likewise, his prudent approach, such as reducing stakes in underperforming stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) to increase cash reserves, demonstrates a strategic \u201crebalancing\u201d tactic that can protect your portfolio from economic downturns. In the future, you can benefit from Buffett\u2019s tactical deployment of that cash to seize opportunities when companies face challenges.\n\nInvesting in Berkshire Hathaway provides a straightforward way to leverage the expertise of one of the world\u2019s most successful investors. For long-term investors, few buy-and-hold stocks offer the stability and growth potential of Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) consistently ranks among the top buy-and-hold dividend stocks for a good reason. Its status as a Dividend Aristocrat, combined with monthly distributions and a solid 5.9% forward yield, makes it a perennial favorite. After a nearly 12% decline over the past year, this stock is attractively priced for long-term investors. Likewise, Realty Income\u2019s operational and fundamental strength remains unchanged, reinforcing its appeal to buyers today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company boasts an impressive 98% occupancy rate across its properties, with 80% of its retail tenants operating in sectors resilient to economic downturns. Most of these tenants are in the grocery sector, alongside convenience stores, dollar stores, and drugstores. This diverse mix ensures stability and minimizes risk, shielding Realty Income from all but the most severe economic downturns.\n\nRealty Income\u2019s triple-net lease model is another key advantage. This arrangement shifts all operational risks and expenses to the tenants, including property maintenance costs. This effectively shields Realty Income from rising material and labor costs, often associated with higher interest rates. Additionally, with leases typically spanning 15 years or more and renewal options in place, Realty Income enjoys a consistent stream of rental income. The average lease term until renewal is just under 10 years, providing the real estate investment trust with significant flexibility over the next decade, regardless of economic conditions.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) stands out among buy-and-hold stocks in that it is attractive to a range of investment strategies and investor preferences, from AI enthusiasts and healthcare proponents to those seeking reliable dividend income.\n\nMedtronic is poised to lead the healthcare AI revolution. Its long-standing partnership with AI powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is pioneering the development of AI-integrated medical hardware. Nvidia\u2019s healthcare vice president, Kim Powell, highlighted the significance of this collaboration, stating that it will \u201caccelerate AI innovation by enabling a software-defined business model, with the goal of improving clinical decision-making, reducing medical variability, and driving better patient outcomes.\u201d Given Nvidia\u2019s industry dominance and history of king-making, Medtronic stands to gain significantly from this partnership.\n\nMoreover, Medtronic is positioned to benefit from the long-term growth of the medical device industry, which is expected to reach $795 billion by 2030, growing at a steady 5.2% compound annual growth rate since 2015. Medtronic holds one of the largest market shares in this industry, second only to diversified firms like McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) that also sell pharmaceuticals.\n\nFor value investors, Medtronic is an attractive option among buy-and-hold stocks. The company boasts a sustainable price-to-book ratio of 1.9x and offers a solid total yield of 5.3%, making it a reliable choice for those looking to build a resilient portfolio.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf any growth stock in today\u2019s crowded, overvalued landscape can be classified as a player among buy and hold stocks, it\u2019s Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD). Businesses face many challenges today and grapple with geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, and supply chain disruptions.\n\nDespite these issues, cyber threats remain the top global risk for most business owners, both small and large. Concerns about cyber threats, data breaches, digital infrastructure vulnerabilities, and ransomware attempts are at the forefront of their minds.\n\nCrowdstrike, a leading cybersecurity stock, is positioned to address these growing threats as technological advancements demand more robust security solutions. The company already serves a diverse clientele, including government agencies, corporations, small businesses, and educational institutions.\n\nImpressively, Crowdstrike\u2019s revenue has significantly increased over the past five quarters, with the last four marking its first consecutive profitable periods. These incremental and successive income boosts, particularly in today\u2019s economic climate, suggest a promising future for Crowdstrike as it continues to lead in digital security and protection.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a stock that demands attention. Known for its cutting-edge data analytics and AI-driven solutions, Palantir carved out a niche in both the public and private sectors. Government agencies, commercial enterprises, and non-profit organizations leverage its platforms, Palantir Gotham and Palantir Foundry, to make sense of complex data and drive informed decision-making.\n\nDespite some volatility in its stock price, Palantir\u2019s growth potential remains strong and remarkably resilient this year, consistently trading in the $25 range. The company keeps nailing high-profile contracts, such as its recent multi-million dollar deals with the U.S. Department of Defense and cutting-edge space companies. These contracts provide steady revenue streams and reinforce Palantir\u2019s reputation as a trusted partner in the data analytics space.\n\nPalantir is an easy pick among buy-and-hold stocks for investors interested in capturing AI and the big data sector\u2019s continued potential. Its continuous innovation, expanding client base, and strategic positioning make it a standout player poised for long-term growth.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you had to guess the best-performing stock of the past few decades, you\u2019d likely think of a big-name tech firm or one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks. However, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) takes the crown, delivering an astounding 31% annualized return since 1998. In comparison, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the second-best performer, achieved a \u201cmere\u201d 28% annual gain.\n\nWhile Monster still has some growth potential, the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in beverage stocks is undoubtedly Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). A January downgrade from Bank of America temporarily pushed share prices down, dropping 3% since then, but that temporary dip presents a prime entry point for investors. Celsius is not resting on its laurels; the company is aggressively expanding into new markets, including Canada, the UK, and Ireland.\n\nBank of America\u2019s concerns about flatlining market share in the saturated U.S. market may have merit, but Celsius\u2019 international growth strategy offers a renewed pathway for rapid expansion. With these new avenues, Celsius is well-positioned to continue its impressive growth trajectory.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is having a tough year amid lithium spot pricing concerns and a string of analyst downgrades. However, these short-term setbacks shouldn\u2019t deter you from considering this stock for long-term gains. The downgrades were mainly influenced by temporary fluctuations in electric vehicle demand, which overlook Albemarle\u2019s strong long-term potential.\n\nAlbemarle specializes in lithium production, and the future demand for lithium looks exceptionally bright. Projections show that by 2030, lithium demand will exceed supply by 500,000 tons annually. These promising growth prospects suggest that concerns about the viability of lithium producers are overblown and that Albemarle\u2019s recent downturn doesn\u2019t reflect its long-term potential.\n\nAlbemarle\u2019s strategic positioning makes it stand out, especially considering the massive lithium demand sector. By 2025, experts predict China will account for nearly half of the global lithium demand.

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Food - Miscellaneous stocks have likely encountered both Utz Brands (UTZ) and Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Utz Brands has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Celsius Holdings Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that UTZ likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CELH has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\n\nUTZ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.92, while CELH has a forward P/E of 53.71. We also note that UTZ has a PEG ratio of 1.13. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 1.65.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for UTZ is its P/B ratio of 1.67. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CELH has a P/B of 39.08.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help UTZ earn a Value grade of B, while CELH has been given a Value grade of D.\n\nUTZ has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than CELH, so it seems like value investors will conclude that UTZ is the superior option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "I Have High Hopes for These 3 Dirt Cheap Dividend Stocks in the Second Half of 2024 (and Beyond)",
        "content": "This year has been a great one for the broader indexes like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which have been driven higher by outsize gains in megacap growth stocks. But other pockets of the market have done fairly poorly, like industry-leading dividend payers whose consistency and stability shine in a downturn but are getting overlooked in today's market.\n\nPepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP), Deere(NYSE: DE), and Chevron(NYSE: CVX) stand out as three dividend stocks that have been underperforming the S&P 500 but look like excellent buys now. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPut some pep in the step of your passive-income stream\n\nIn her 12-year stint as PepsiCo CEO, Indra Nooyi helped improve its brand and grow profits. Since taking over as CEO in October 2018, Ramon Laguarta has done a good job navigating many unexpected challenges, including the U.S.-China trade war, the worst of the pandemic, inflation, and supply chain bottlenecks. Effective management is extremely important, since every percentage point in margin can mean hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFor Pepsi, growth usually comes from new product developments, strategic acquisitions, or efficiency improvements. Nooyi was instrumental in helping Pepsi acquire Quaker Oats and Gatorade. But arguably the biggest deal under Laguarta's tenure has been with the energy drink company Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH).\n\nThe company entered a partnership with the upstart beverage company in August 2022. It included a $550 million cash investment in exchange for convertible stock, an estimated 8.5% ownership in Celsius on a converted basis, and a 5% annual dividend. As with other consumer goods companies, Celsius shares have pulled back recently, but there's plenty of reason to think the deal will pay off over the long term.\n\nCelsius also benefits from using PepsiCo's strategic distribution network. It is a complicated business -- arguably far more complicated than its peer, Coca-Cola -- because PepsiCo operates its own production facilities compared to Coke's royalty/franchise model. PepsiCo is also involved in far more product categories besides beverages, like snacks and breakfast items, whereas Coke focuses on what it does best: beverages.\n\nPepsi has a lower market capitalization than Coke but generates roughly double the revenue and half the operating margin. Due to its size and business model, it is a bit more vulnerable than Coke. However, the company's past management and current leadership have a track record of effective capital allocation.\n\nHovering around a 52-week low with a 3.3% yield, over 50 years of consecutive dividend raises, and a 24.5 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, PepsiCo stands out as an excellent stock to buy and hold for years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeere may be cyclical, but the stock is a bargain\n\nAfter an initial surge in early 2021, Deere stock has gone practically nowhere despite achieving record profits last year. Unfortunately, there have been glaring signs that Deere could enter a downturn.\n\nIt is a highly cyclical stock. When the company's customers are in expansion mode (and financing is inexpensive), they might be inclined to make a big purchase of its industrial machinery like farming and forestry equipment.\n\nBut when the cycle turns, Deere's sales can fall in a flash. The trick is to pay a reasonable multiple based on a company's mid-cycle earnings. Its P/E will look low when it is coming off a strong year and will be high coming off a bad year. Understandably, its P/E looks dirt cheap at just 10.9 -- but earnings are expected to decline over the medium term.\n\nConsensus analyst estimates have Deere earning $22.79 per share in fiscal 2024 and $22 in fiscal 2025,\u00a0compared to $33.17 in fiscal 2023.\n\nIt would be one thing if Deere's stock surged in lockstep with its earnings growth, but it didn't. In fact, earnings have nearly doubled over the last three years while the stock is up just 3%. Deere's earnings could be cut in half, and it would still have a P/E of about 22. It is simply too good a company to be this cheap. DE Chart\n\nAnother reason to get excited about Deere is its earnings trajectory and automation and artificial intelligence advancements. The company has been ramping up research and development spending, investing in autonomous tractors, and automating farm tasks, such as crop spacing and recommended fertilizer use that can save operators money. It is making sizable product improvements that might not impact its bottom line until the next uptick in the cycle.\n\nThe stock only yields 1.6%,\u00a0but that's mainly because it uses both dividends and buybacks to reward shareholders. Over the last five years, the dividend is up over 93% while its outstanding share count is down 12.5%. That's roughly the same pace of buybacks that Apple has done in the last five years, which is impressive considering Apple is famous for buying back a boatload of its stock.\n\nAdd it all up, and Deere looks like an excellent value stock to buy now.\n\nA relatively safe way to invest in the energy sector\n\nChevron is another stock that has gone practically nowhere over the last year or so. There are a few factors at play. The first is uncertainty regarding Chevron's acquisition of Hess, whose crown jewel is its stake in the Stabroek drilling block off the shores of Guyana. The other partners in the Guyana joint venture -- ExxonMobil and CNOOC, a Chinese national oil company -- are looking to stymie the deal and keep Chevron out of Guyana.\n\nThe good news is that Chevron doesn't need the deal to go through to be a great investment. It can continue ramping up spending in its existing plays, namely the Permian Basin. It can also continue buying back its stock, which remains a good value with a 14.4 P/E ratio.\n\nIt's also important to know how the market can reward or overlook certain qualities at different times. Right now, sentiment is optimistic, and peers like ExxonMobil are rewarded for higher spending and bold acquisitions.\n\nMany other companies have followed suit. Even ConocoPhillips, which is known for being a conservative capital allocator, announced it is acquiring Marathon Oil in a blockbuster $22.5 billion deal. With Chevron's major deal in limbo, there's just one more box left unchecked.\n\nChevron's financial health and prudence could also be getting overlooked right now. When oil prices are falling, investors often gravitate toward safe, stodgy, dividend-paying names like Chevron. And for good reason. Its financial health helped it acquire multiple companies at compelling valuations during the COVID-induced downturn when other producers were struggling to stay afloat.\n\nFor the last three years or so, oil prices have been remarkably stable and strong, which might convince some investors to gravitate toward riskier, more-leveraged plays. It could work out, but long-term investors know the best way to compound gains is to buy quality companies and hold them as long as the investment thesis remains intact.\n\nIn sum, Chevron has the qualities of an excellent long-term holding. Its greatest strength is its financial health, which is particularly important given the volatile nature of commodities like oil and gas. With its 4.2% dividend yield, the company stands out as a compelling choice for generating passive income regardless of oil prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the first quarter, the fund\u2019s Investor Class APFDX returned 8.40%, Advisor Class APDDX posted a return of 8.37%, and Institutional Class APHDX returned 8.48%, compared to an 8.20% return for the MSCI All Country World Index.

Celsius is an energy drink company viewed as a healthier option than its large competitors. We believe Celsius' product portfolio both appeals to a broad demographic that is attracting new consumers and has more frequent usage occasions than other energy drinks, enabling Celsius to grow sales through market share gains and market expansion. Furthermore, the company signed a US distribution partnership with PepsiCo in October 2022, expanding its distribution and increasing penetration wherever it\u2019s already sold. The end result should be better product availability, increased brand awareness, higher sales volumes and scale-driven margin improvements.\" 20 States that Drink the Least Alcohol per Capita\n\nA hand pouring a cool can of a carbonated non-alcoholic beverage with a smiley face on it.\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc.

        "title": "Celsius Holdings (CELH) Down 28% in a Month: Should You Buy the Dip?",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings, Inc. CELH has witnessed a significant decline over the past month, with its shares plummeting 27.7%, underperforming the industry's drop of 5.1%. The company also trailed the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector's decrease of 2.1% and the S&P 500's growth of 3.7% during the same period. This downturn in the stock price can largely be attributed to the slowing growth of the company and intense competition in the energy drinks market.\r\n\r\nClosing at $57.84 in the last trading session, the stock stands almost 42% below its 52-week high of $99.62. Furthermore, CELH is trading below its 50-day moving average, signaling potential bearish sentiment in maintaining recent performance levels.\r\n\r\nDespite the downside, Celsius Holdings is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 47.2, which significantly exceeds the industry average of 15.44. This valuation discrepancy indicates that while investors have high expectations for Celsius Holdings' future growth, the stock's current performance and the broader market challenges could pose risks.\n\nCELH Stock Trades Below 50-Day Average Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnpacking the Stock's Recent Slide\n\nA key factor behind CELH\u2019s recent bearish performance could be the slowing down of its revenue growth. While Celsius Holdings has consistently reported strong year-over-year growth, recent quarters have shown signs of deceleration. The company's first-quarter 2024 earnings report highlighted a 37% year-over-year increase in revenues, which slowed down considerably from the triple-digit surge witnessed in previous years. Revenues in the quarter were affected by inventory movements by the company\u2019s largest customer.\r\n\r\nThe year-over-year inventory variation is attributed to elevated restocking in the first quarter of 2023, which was absent this year. Ongoing inventory fluctuations are anticipated in subsequent quarters as Celsius Holdings\u2019 largest distributor accounts for about 62% of the total North America business.\r\n\r\nApart from this, stiff competition from major players like Monster Beverage MNST and Red Bull could hamper the company\u2019s ability to maintain its robust market share. Additionally, macroeconomic headwinds such as underlying inflation and higher interest rates, which have been impacting consumers\u2019 budgets, create a challenging backdrop for consumer goods companies.\r\n\r\nWhile Celsius Holdings is committed to increasing its marketing and promotional initiatives, these investments come at the cost of margins. The company also remains troubled by the rising cost of fuel and several commodities.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) for 2024 and 2025 has declined 3.6% to $1.07 and 5.5% to $1.38, respectively, over the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nEstimate Revision Chart Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIs the Show Really Over for CELH?\n\nWhile the high valuation and recent performance issues raise caution, long-term investors might see the recent fall as a buying opportunity, given Celsius Holdings' strong market presence, innovative product offerings and strategic partnerships.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, Celsius Holdings remains a strong player in the energy drink market with a loyal customer base and a growing international presence. The company's health-focused beverages resonate well with millennials increasingly seeking wellness-oriented alternatives.\r\n\r\nA key driver of Celsius Holdings\u2019 growth has been its expanding distribution network. The company has secured shelf space in major retail chains, convenience stores and online platforms, significantly enhancing its market reach. Partnerships with leading distributors and retailers, such as Walmart WMT, Target and Amazon, have provided a strong platform for future growth.\r\n\r\nMoving on, the company continues to innovate with new product launches that cater to evolving consumer preferences. Its product line includes a variety of flavors and formulations, including carbonated and non-carbonated options, as well as powdered supplements. This commitment to innovation ensures Celsius Holdings\u2019 relevance in the dynamic beverage industry.\r\n\r\nCelsius Holdings' strategic acquisitions and partnerships, including collaborations with industry giants like PepsiCo PEP and influential fitness brands, further underscore its proactive approach to boosting brand awareness, consumer engagement and sustaining growth.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nWhile CELH faces near-term challenges, including market pressures and operational hurdles, its strategic initiatives and innovative approach could pave the way for recovery and sustained growth in the future. All said, current investors should hold their positions in the stock, while potential new investors should consider waiting for a more favorable entry point.\r\n\r\nCelsius Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "5 Top Stocks to Buy in July",
        "content": "Now that we're officially halfway through 2024, it's time to reflect on where the stock market has been. Although no one knows what the market will do in the short term, we can try to filter out the noise and be aware of what's driving broader themes. A good place to start is by looking at sector performance.\n\nThere are 11 sectors in the S&P 500. And only two of them -- tech and communications -- are outperforming the index. Right off the bat, it tells you that growth-heavy sectors are doing well, and value and income stocks are lagging. Dig deeper, and you'll find that mega-cap growth, more so than smaller growth stocks, are driving the bulk of the gains in the major indexes.\n\nInvestors looking for buying opportunities outside of mega caps have come to the right place. Here's why these Motley Fool contributors are particularly excited about Okta(NASDAQ: OKTA), Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH), Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC), NextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE), and Home Depot(NYSE: HD). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPlease identify yourself\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Okta): It's a great time to get excited about Okta stock again. The software-as-a-service specialist, which sells cybersecurity and digital identity management services, is trading at about where it was at the beginning of the year. Yet its prospects are brightening.\n\nSales in the most recent quarter were up a healthy 19% to $617 million. Almost all of the revenue figures are subscription-based, too, which gives shareholders confidence that sales won't swing wildly during any upcoming industry slowdown.\n\nOkta is not profitable just yet, but that won't be true for long. Operating losses narrowed to 8% of sales last quarter from over 30% a year ago. Meanwhile, cash flow is solidly in positive territory, at nearly 40% of sales.\n\nAccording to its late May outlook, management is projecting a growth slowdown in the coming months, with second-quarter revenue gains decelerating to about 14%. Sales should rise by about 13% for the full fiscal year, too. But investors should look past that short-term volatility toward Okta's likely impressive earnings growth over the next several fiscal years.\n\nBuying the stock in July and patiently waiting for these benefits to accrue will put you in a great financial position when you reflect on your decision to buy this small but growing tech company.\n\nGet energized with Celsius\n\nAnders Bylund (Celsius Holdings): Known for its fitness-focused energy drinks, Celsius is brewing up impressive growth. Unlike archrivals Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) or Red Bull, Celsius focuses on providing a fitness-centric boost, with no artificial preservatives or flavors. It has proved to be a recipe for success, especially with the distribution expertise of Celsius partner PepsiCo.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Pepsi deal is paying off big time, expanding Celsius' reach globally and boosting brand visibility. International growth is only getting started, leaving a ton of overseas opportunities to explore. The health-focused branding message should resonate just as strongly in valuable markets such as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.\n\nThe stock isn't exactly cheap, trading at 61 times earnings and 9.4 times sales. But those valuation ratios are still a bargain compared to Celsius' loftier figures over the last couple of years. A 28.6% price drop in June took the edge off a skyrocketing stock chart, giving Celsius investors a chance to load up on shares at a lower price premium.\n\nThe heart of Celsius' idea is that its health-conscious growth story has many chapters left. The Pepsi partnership has proved effective, and the company is expanding its brand around the world. The stock isn't cheap, but it has earned every drop of that premium price tag. Those lofty ratios should calm down as it executes its profitable growth plans over the next few years.\n\nThere is room for a third global giant in the booming energy drink industry. Many have tried and failed to fill that role. With soaring sales and robust profit margins already under its belt, Celsius looks primed to get the job done. That's why its stock is a hot buy in July.\n\nAn attractive valuation, dividend, and business\n\nKeith Speights (Ares Capital): I have a condition I call investors' acrophobia. The higher the stock market goes, the more afraid I become. With the S&P 500 continuing to rise, my nervousness is increasing. But Ares Capital is the kind of stock I don't have qualms about in a pricey market.\n\nAres is a leading business development company (BDC). And its stock is dirt cheap, with shares trading at only 8.7 times forward earnings.\n\nThat attractive valuation isn't because the company's business is floundering. Its earnings continue to grow. CEO Kipp deVeer said in the first-quarter earnings press release, \"With our competitive advantages, we believe we are well positioned to build upon our nearly 20-year track record of generating attractive investment returns for our shareholders.\"\n\nThose competitive advantages include a stronger financial position and more investment professionals than its rivals have. Ares Capital has a longer history in the industry than most direct lenders. Unsurprisingly, the company has delivered significantly higher returns on equity (ROE) and total returns than other BDCs.\n\nIncome investors should love the forward dividend yield of over 9.3%. Even if you're not an income investor, this hefty yield gives Ares a head start on delivering exceptional returns.\n\nAre there risks associated with investing in a BDC that provides financing to middle-market businesses? Sure. However, Ares Capital has proved to be remarkably resilient, generating strong ROE during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and the pandemic period of 2020 and 2021.\n\nWhether or not you have investors' acrophobia, Ares Capital looks like a great stock to buy in July.\n\nAny drop in this stock's price is an opportunity to buy\n\nNeha Chamaria(NextEra Energy): I recommended NextEra Energy in May, and while the stock surged during the month, it has come under a bit of pressure over the past couple of weeks or so. I believe the fall was unwarranted, and with NextEra Energy reminding investors yet again about its growth potential and plans, I am picking it as my top stock to buy now.\n\nInvestors were spooked when management announced plans to sell equity units worth $2 billion in mid-June. What they might have overlooked, though, is the reason the company is raising money via a share sale: to fund growth.\n\nAt its latest Europe investor presentation, NextEra Energy quoted an industry report projecting fourfold power demand growth in the U.S. over the next couple of decades versus the previous 20 years. As the owner and operator of the largest utility in the U.S., Florida Power & Light, NextEra is primed to benefit from any surge in power demand.\n\nTo top that, the company is also the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and a leader in battery storage. It announced plans to invest $65 billion to $70 billion over the next four years with a potential to develop 36.5 to 46.5 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable and storage capacity through 2027.\n\nThat brings us back to why the fall of NextEra Energy stock after the company announced an equity sale was an overreaction. With its utility and renewables businesses, it could spend around $100 billion between 2024 and 2027. But equity issues are expected to be only about 5% of the company's total projected spending. It expects to fund the bulk of its growth through cash generated from operations and will rely more on debt than equity to fund the remaining portion.\n\nWith NextEra Energy further reiterating its adjusted earnings-per-share growth projection of 6% to 8% through 2027 and increases in dividends of around 10% through 2026, I believe any drop in the stock's price is an opportunity to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nHome Depot knows how to navigate a cyclical slowdown\n\nDaniel Foelber (Home Depot): In the long term, stock market winners are companies that can grow earnings over time through innovation, staying flexible, and savvy acquisitions. But in the short term, the market is often driven by narratives.\n\nRight now, the market is marching higher to the beat of the mega-cap growth drum. But behind the scenes, many industry-leading consumer-facing companies like Home Depot have seen their stock prices get left behind. The home-improvement retailer's stock is down year to date and up less than 10% over the last three years compared to a 24.3% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nAt least part of the sell-off is justified. Home Depot and its peer Lowe's Companies are facing a difficult housing market. Management commentary hasn't shied away from its impact on results.\n\nHigh volume in home sales is great for Home Depot and Lowe's because homebuying coincides with home improvement. But if homebuying is low or so expensive that consumers have little left over for home improvement, then they might be less inclined to pair pricey projects with a home purchase.\n\nThe economic indicators point to relatively expensive housing, record-high credit card debt, and some of the highest mortgage interest rates in the last decade -- all bad news for Home Depot.\n\nDespite these challenges, the company has continued investing through the cycle with new store openings and expansions. On June 18, it completed its $18.3 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution -- which boosts its building products and roofing materials offerings. Management has been targeting professional contractors as a key growth area that can help diversify the business to be less dependent on consumer sales.\n\nOn the surface, this strategy looks fairly aggressive, considering all the near-term challenges. But the company has historically been an excellent capital allocator and has the balance sheet needed to take market share during a slowdown rather than be passive.\n\nHome Depot is also a reliable dividend stock. In February, it announced a 7.7% increase to its dividend, bringing it to $2.25 per share per quarter, or $9 per year. The dividend is up 379% over the last decade and 65% over the last five years. With a yield of 2.6%, it's an excellent dividend stock to buy for patient investors who believe in the company's ability to navigate cyclical ebbs and flows.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Okta right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Okta, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Okta wasn\u2019t one of them.

The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has soared 27,310% in the past 10 years, making it one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nBut there's a much smaller business that has performed even better. I'm talking about Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH). This beverage stock has skyrocketed 27,360% in the past decade (as of June 25), turning a $10,000 investment into a jaw-dropping $2.7 million.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Celsius' meteoric rise to becoming a $13-billion business today. Then by viewing things with a fresh perspective, investors can assess if the stock is a smart buying opportunity.\n\nEnergizing growth\n\nIf you see a stock that has skyrocketed as much as Celsius has, it's worth taking the time to figure out what factors led to such a strong performance. In this case, it shouldn't be a surprise that the key driver of Celsius' ascent has been incredible sales growth.\n\nBehind only Red Bull and Monster Beverage, the business has become the third-largest energy drink seller in the U.S. In 2023, Celsius reported revenue of $1.3 billion. That figure was 102% higher than the year before. And it represented an impressive 25-fold increase from only five years ago.\n\nWhile the broader non-alcoholic beverage industry might be extremely mature, the energy drink category is registering faster growth. Perhaps consumers aren't interested in drinking sugary beverages as much as they were 10 or 20 years ago. Or maybe there's simply a heightened focus on drinks that are supposedly healthier for you.\n\nThis is what Celsius aims to be. By marketing its products as functional beverages that have certain health benefits, it has steadily gained consumer mindshare. Any consumer-facing brand should strive to do just this.\n\nCelsius has also benefited from getting its drinks in front of more customers. This means expanding its presence in various retail settings. The business is also finding tremendous success on Amazon, an extremely popular e-commerce site that gets billions of visitors each month.\n\nAnd with the help of PepsiCo, which is Celsius' distribution partner both domestically and abroad, this company is in a favorable position to keep finding success.\n\nIs it too late to buy Celsius stock?\n\nSince hitting their all-time high in March of this year, Celsius shares have been nosediving, tanking 42% in less than five weeks. On May 28, Dara Mohsenian, a research analyst at Morgan Stanley, published a note that said the company's sales fell sequentially during the week ending May 18, causing Celsius' market share to dip slightly.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut even after its monumental decline, I still believe Celsius is an overvalued stock. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 61.6. That's a steep valuation to pay, particularly as sales are slowing down. And I think it gives prospective investors zero margin of safety.\n\nCelsius is expected to increase revenue at an annualized clip of 31% between 2023 and 2026. This is a far cry from the triple-digit growth investors have probably become accustomed to.\n\nWhat also worries me is that these projections could prove to be overly optimistic. Celsius has likely already taken advantage of the so-called low-hanging-fruit opportunity with its Pepsi deal. Moreover, the industry has virtually no barriers to entry. There's nothing stopping a well-funded entrepreneur from starting his or her own energy drink business, which consumers could flock to.\n\nCelsius has undoubtedly been a fantastic investment in the past decade, turning a small sum into nearly $3 million. But the stock doesn't look like a smart buying opportunity today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Will Celsius Stock (NASDAQ:CELH) Recover? My Thoughts as a Soft-Drink Business Owner",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) stock has taken a hammering in recent months after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), quoting the latest Nielsen data, suggested that the growth-focused firm had lost market share. This has been compounded by additional data inferring that further incremental gains in the energy drinks market may be challenging. I\u2019m neutral on Celsius because despite liking the brand, the stock looks a little expensive to me.\n\nIs There a Market for Celsius?\n\nWhile I\u2019m actually a founder of my own health-focused soft drinks business, it\u2019s a million miles away from a company like Celsius. However, it\u2019s certainly interesting to see Celsius develop its niche and gain market share.\n\nCelsius positions itself as a healthier alternative to traditional soft drinks, offering beverages made with natural ingredients and caffeine sourced from nature. Emphasizing its commitment to healthy living, the company produces drinks without added sugars, aligning with current consumer trends.\n\nIn recent years, Celsius has capitalized on the growing demand for healthier beverage options. This is appealing to those seeking a more natural and refreshing way to stay energized and hydrated.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a caveat. Celsius replaces the sugar with things like the artificial sweetener sucralose. For context, when I made my health-focused soft drink \u2014 it\u2019s called Sumacqua \u2014 I decided I\u2019d rather have some sugar from natural sources like grape juice \u2014 which is high in polyphenols \u2014 rather than artificial ingredients.\n\nNonetheless, many people in the industry still see this as an improvement on traditional sugar-heavy canned drinks like cola, which are partially responsible for the widespread nature of diabetes. Celsius also claims to create metabolically positive drinks. These claims are only possible if you have the research to back it up.\n\nIn short, there appears to be great scope for growth. Celsius is operating in growing markets, with the healthy drinks market expected to grow from $344.36 billion in 2023 to $408.8 billion by 2028. However, it\u2019s worth noting that Celsius doesn\u2019t necessarily fall into this category; it is often referred to as an energy+ drink (an energy drink designed to boost metabolism and burn fat).\n\nData Turns on Celsius\n\nOn May 15, Morgan Stanley reported that Celsius saw a minor market share dip from 10.8% to 10.5% based on Nielsen data. In turn, this led to a swift sell-off and arguably one that was justified. At 100x earnings and 20x sales, the stock was priced for perfection. For context, I was told by private equity that if my business hit $1 million in sales in a year, it would be valued on a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of three to five.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Truist analyst Bill Chappell has suggested that while few companies make it above 10% market share, incremental gains from here on will be challenging. Chappell noted that further growth may necessitate converting loyal customers of Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Red Bull.\n\nWhat Do the Forecasts Say About Celsius?\n\nCelsius is expected to register earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08 in 2024, and that then rises dramatically to $1.45 in 2025 and $1.99 in 2026. This is impressive growth for a company that\u2019s not operating in a fast-moving sector like technology or biotech. Looking beyond 2026, the number of analysts offering forecasts falls to just one. The singular analysts suggest that Celsius\u2019s EPS will rise to $4.84 by 2033.\n\nSo, what do these earnings projections mean for valuation metrics? Well, Celsius is currently trading at 51.69x non-GAAP forward earnings. This price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio then falls to 38.64x in 2025 and 28.07x in 2026. The TTM P/S ratio has fallen to 9.4x, and the forward ratio sits at 7.9x.\n\nAccording to the forecasts, earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of around 28.8% over the next five years. Given the 51.69x non-GAAP forward P/E, Celsius does look a little expensive. The price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio sits at 1.8x.\n\nIs Celsius Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, CELH comes in as a Moderate Buy based on nine Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Celsius Holdings stock price target is $80.33, implying a 40.7% downside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Celsius Stock\n\nI like Celsius\u2019s brand, and I think they\u2019re taking the industry in the right direction. Very few companies have successfully taken on the soft drinks market with a healthier alternative to the legacy brands producing forms of lemonade and cola. However, I do wonder, as noted by Truist analyst Chappell, whether incremental gains will be harder to come by from here on.\n\nEqually, I believe the company is a little on the expensive side, even considering the strong earnings trajectory. This is highlighted by the PEG ratio of 1.8x. Personally, I\u2019m already over-invested in the sector, given my attempts to start my own soft drinks company. But if I weren\u2019t, I probably wouldn\u2019t be investing in Celsius. While it\u2019s a promising company, I\u2019m neutral on the stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before They Soar as Much as 75%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "A resurgence in the popularity of stock splits has been front and center in 2024 as a number of high-profile stocks have taken the plunge. Companies will typically go down this path after years or even decades of robust operating and financial results have pushed the stock price out of reach of some investors. While a stock split doesn't change anything about the underlying value of the business, it does make shares more affordable for employees and everyday investors, a reason that is often given by companies as the principal motivation for the split.\n\nInvestors, however, should focus on the robust results that ultimately led to the stock split, as this is historically an indicator of a business that is firing on all cylinders, which is a brilliant reason to own the stock.\n\nLet's take a look at two companies that still have significant upside ahead, according to certain Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 59%\n\nThe first stock-split stock with mounds of upside is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker was already the gold standard for graphics processing units (GPUs) used by gamers and in data centers. However, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) early last year kicked its business into overdrive.\n\nThe company is referred to as a \"picks-and-shovels play.\" The investing reference has its origins in a famous quote attributed to Mark Twain: \"During the gold rush, it's a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.\" For the AI gold rush, Nvidia is supplying the picks and shovels.\n\nThe parallel-processing capability of Nvidia's GPUs was groundbreaking for rendering lifelike images in video games. It allows them to run a magnitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. It turns out this same functionality works equally well at processing AI.\n\nNvidia's recent results show why most analysts on Wall Street are upbeat. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia's revenue jumped 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, while earnings per share (EPS) surged 629% to $5.98. The company's data center segment, which includes the processors used for AI, has become the company's biggest money maker, as revenue of $22.6 billion jumped 427%.\n\nNvidia recently completed its high-profile, 10-for-1 stock split, and despite posting gains of more than 194% over the past year (as of this writing), Wall Street remains remarkably bullish. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann boosted his price target to $200 while reiterating a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains for investors of 59% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccelerating demand for AI-centric processors forms the foundation of the analyst's thesis, but he believes the secret sauce is Nvidia's proprietary software that's coupled with its best-in-class chips.\n\n\"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability,\" Mosesmann wrote. The analyst's price target suggests Nvidia's market will soar to nearly $5 trillion over the next year.\n\nDespite the stock's epic run over the past year, Wall Street is still remarkably bullish on Nvidia. Of the 57 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 53 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nCelsius Holdings: Implied upside of 75%\n\nAnother stock-split stock with significant upside potential is Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH). The company's focus on health-centric energy drinks has been a hit with consumers. It's the third-largest energy drink brand and the fastest-growing, contributing 47% of all industry growth in the first quarter, outpacing larger rivals Red Bull and Monster Beverage.\n\nCelsius holds an enviable position in an industry that continues to grow. The energy drink category has continued to generate robust growth over the past three years, even as the broader beverage category has contracted -- and Celsius is leading the charge.\n\nIn the first quarter, revenue grew 37% year over year to $356 million, while diluted EPS surged 108%. It's always encouraging when profits are growing faster than revenue, as this illustrates that a company has reached the scale necessary to drop more income to the bottom line.\n\nThe company's sales more than doubled last year as it leaned into its partnership with PepsiCo, which resulted in the beverage and snacks giant making a $550 million investment in Celsius, taking an 8.5% stake in the company and inking a long-term distribution agreement. This is a double-edged sword, however, as Celsius now faces tough comps after such a banner year.\n\nCelsius Holdings conducted its 3-for-1 stock split late last year, thanks to its track record of robust performance. However, fears regarding slowing growth have punished the stock, which has shed 42% over the past month, but some on Wall Street are undaunted. Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala has a $98 price target and a buy rating on the shares. That represents potential gains for investors of 75% compared to Tuesday's closing price. The analyst noted the drawdown is \"normal in year two of [a] national distribution\" agreement and advises investors to ignore the \"near-term noise.\"\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Celsius. Of the 16 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in May, 14 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Highs And Lows: Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) Vs The Rest Of The Beverages and Alcohol Stocks\n\nThe end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let\u2019s take a look at how beverages and alcohol stocks fared in Q1, starting with Monster (NASDAQ:MNST).\n\nThese companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the explosion of alcoholic craft beer drinks or the steady decline of non-alcoholic sugary sodas. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.\n\nThe 13 beverages and alcohol stocks we track reported a decent Q1; on average, revenues were in line with analyst consensus estimates. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 15.8% below consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and beverages and alcohol stocks have had a rough stretch, with share prices down 5.8% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nMonster (NASDAQ:MNST)\n\nFounded in 2002 as a natural soda and juice company, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) is a pioneer of the energy drink category, and its Monster Energy brand targets a young, active demographic.\n\nMonster reported revenues of $1.90 billion, up 11.8% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 0.2%. It was a slower quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' operating margin and\u00a0earnings estimates.\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, \u201cWe continue to see growth in the energy drink market globally. In the United States, energy is the only segment of the beverage category currently showing unit growth. We continue to grow our sales in non-Nielsen measured channels.

        "title": "Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) Is Very Good At Capital Allocation",
        "content": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) we really liked what we saw.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Celsius Holdings is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.23 = US$305m \u00f7 (US$1.6b - US$315m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nSo, Celsius Holdings has an ROCE of 23%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 17% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Celsius Holdings  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Celsius Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Celsius Holdings .\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nThe fact that Celsius Holdings is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making five years ago but is is now generating 23% on its capital. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 3,731% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, both common traits of a multi-bagger.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nOverall, Celsius Holdings gets a big tick from us thanks in most part to the fact that it is now profitable and is reinvesting in its business. Since the stock has returned a staggering 4,342% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Celsius Holdings can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\n\nOne more thing to note, we've identified  1 warning sign  with Celsius Holdings and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings is not the only stock earning high returns.

        "content": "In recent years, stock investors faced heightened volatility. An economic downturn in 2022 erased gains. Last year, the Nasdaq\u00a0Composite saw a 43% increase due to AI and tech drivers, which broke previous patterns. Although investors are now seeing an 8% increase in 2024, volatility is still certainly the name of the game. Some of the hyper-growth stocks that have soared the most have AI catalysts many don\u2019t necessarily 100% believe in.\n\nThat said, there are a number of hyper-growth stocks to buy that don\u2019t require the AI backstory to be successful. These companies can survive and thrive with or without this current market tailwind. Let\u2019s dive into why now may be a reasonable time to consider adding these names.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nFirst on the list is Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). Known for developing and selling functional drinks and supplements, this company is one of the hyper-growth stocks to buy over the long term. Its energy drinks are widely popular, driving strong share price appreciation after the company\u2019s Q1 2024 results that exceeded market expectations. Analysts are bullish on the company\u2019s long-term prospects, considering its recent successful partnerships with other soft drink companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius\u2019 products are not only your average energy drinks, but they are actually healthy. Its Live Fit drinks contain 90% of Vitamin C, 130% of Riboflavin, and 120% for Vitamin B6. Although the market remains hesitant due to its slowing growth, investors are optimistic due to its strong retail demand.\n\n34 hedge fund portfolios held CELH at the end of Q1, indicating room to run higher. Revenue reached $355.7 million, representing a 37% year-over-year increase. Moreover, a new partnership with Ferrari racing positions Celsius to potentially gain market share in the energy and soft drink industry.\n\nCrocs Inc. (CROX) The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nSource: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nKnown for their remarkable design and comfort-forward shoes, Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) still continues to see strong demand from its customers. Currently, the brand operates in 85 countries and has wholesalers, retail stores, e-commerce platforms, and third-party marketplaces as their platforms. Listed under Nasdaq, the company has robust business and is expected to move well above the $145 per share level, and stay there, moving forward.\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 results highlighted strong demand, with revenue increasing 6% and earnings per share surging 5%. Brand sales reached $744 million despite HEYDUDE revenue falling and reaching only $195 million. However, the company\u2019s brand portfolio is expected to grow 9% in 2024, despite a decline in HEYDUDE.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, the stock is trading at bargain levels. I think this company could be among the most undervalued in its sector right now.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Matterport company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass. MTTR stock.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock\n\nSpecializing in detailed 3D models bolstered by property tech, Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) is another one of the top hyper-growth stocks to buy. With advancing technologies like Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro, accessing digital property tours becomes more seamless and appealing particularly to clients in hospitality and commercial real estate sectors.\n\nRecently, the company launched an emissions reporting tool for select enterprise customers, measuring carbon savings from using its digital twin platform. Developed with carbon accounting experts, this platform helps companies understand emissions avoided by remote collaboration. As corporations increasingly commit to reducing their carbon footprint, this tool supports alignment with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals and science-based climate targets.\n\nIn other related news, CoStar Group revealed its acquisition of Matterport primarily for real estate. The acquisition, valued at $1.6 billion, includes a split of cash and stock, offering shareholders $2.75 per share in cash and $2.75 in CoStar Group shares. Matterport had previously gone public through a SPAC in 2021.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Growth Stock Down 34% to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "For most of 2024, Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) stock has been on a good run, hitting an all-time high of $96.11 in March. After a little dip in April, the stock came back up before falling nearly 40% from its 2024 high just over the last month. Shareholders have had their conviction tested during this roller-coaster ride.\n\nThere are reasons for the volatility in the stock price, but the question investors should always ask when a stock falls dramatically in a short time is whether the severity of the sell-off is warranted. Let's dig in and see why Celsius remains a stock to buy, even after this dip.\n\nMeteoric growth has slowed\n\nOne of the main reasons Celsius stock has been on such a run-up over the last few years has been the company's eye-popping revenue-growth results. Over the past five years, quarterly year-over-year revenue growth has consistently been above 50%, often reaching triple digits. The company also has turned sustainably profitable and generated increasing amounts of free cash flow over the last several quarters.\n\nUnfortunately, in the most recently reported quarter (Q1 of fiscal 2024), revenue growth was 37%. This was lower than Wall Street analysts expected, and the stock sold off, likely kicking off the 40% drawdown seen over the past several weeks.\n\nTaken out of context, there's nothing to be concerned about with 37% revenue growth. However, when a stock has been trading near all-time highs, anything perceived as not living up to expectations could send shares tumbling.\n\nExpanding internationally\n\nThe vast majority of Celsius' revenue comes from North America. In Q1, the share from North America was 95%. Interestingly, as overall revenue slowed to 37%, international revenue increased by 43% and revenue in Europe grew by 63% year over year. Celsius sees international markets as an opportunity for future expansion of the business.\n\nRecently, the company began selling its products in the United Kingdom and Ireland and expects to expand further in those countries. In addition, it expects to begin sales in Australia, New Zealand, and France in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nThe pace of this international growth is made possible by the distribution deal Celsius signed with PepsiCo in late 2022. One of the benefits of this agreement was Pepsi's ability to facilitate Celsius' international expansion.\n\nThis deal is less than one year old, but the early international results are promising. Investors should keep an eye on this over the next year as these growth efforts start to accelerate following a late 2024 launch.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius isn't cheap but is cheaper\n\nEven after the stock sell-off, Celsius is still an expensive stock. It currently trades for 11 times trailing sales (P/S) and 70 times trailing earnings (P/E). That said, both of these metrics have been significantly higher in the past year.\n\nCelsius is also expensive when compared to its closest competitor Monster Beverage, which has a P/S of 7 and a P/E of 30. However, Monster has much slower growth rates. In Q1, the company had year-over-year revenue growth of only 12%.\n\nWhile Celsius isn't cheap, it's near where its valuation has been historically over the past few years. For investors who believe the company will continue to see strong growth, buying shares today could prove to be a bargain.\n\nThat said, a further slowdown in the coming quarters would likely send the stock falling further. Dollar-cost averaging into this stock may make sense for most investors.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "It\u2019s a good time to be in growth stocks. The major U.S. indices have continued their ascent as publicly listed companies churn out better-than-expected earnings reports and the inflation gets back under control. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has climbed 17.8% on a year-to-date basis, while its counterpart, the S&P 500, rallied around 14.7% in the same period. The May consumer price index (CPI) report that the Bureau of Labor Statistics released last week has definitely been in a catalyst in the market\u2019s most recent rally.\n\nInflation in the United States is back on a downward trend, giving relief to not only consumers and investors, but also Federal Reserve officials who are looking for additional encouragement to begin easing current rate policy. The producer price index, which measures wholesale prices, also eased more than economists had predicted.\n\nThese datapoints are great for the market, but not even positive macroeconomic data will help revive the shares of these 3 growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity is an increasingly important aspect of modern cloud technologies. The migration of enterprise data from on-premises servers to remote ones (cloud) has been key to many businesses\u2019 digital transformation efforts. While the hosting data in the cloud is much more expensive than doing so internally, many enterprises are finding the shift to be less costly overtime.\n\nHowever, having data stored in some remote data center does require special protection against cyberattacks. That\u2019s where a company like SentinelOne (NYSE:S) comes in. The cybersecurity firm\u2019s Singularity Platform leverages artificial intelligence models and automation to secure various endpoints across an enterprise.\n\nIn the early 2020s, SentinelOne enjoyed triple-digit revenue growth as companies who had migrated their internal systems to the cloud required more security. The global pandemic, of course, also helped to spur demand for cloud security services.\n\nUnfortunately, SentinelOne\u2019s growth has been negatively impacted by the uneven macroeconomic outlook. In their recent earnings call, the firm\u2019s management team still mentions how \u201cmacroeconomic uncertainty and tighter financial conditions continue to impact customer buying behavior,\u201d which has soured SentinelOne\u2019s growth outlook.\n\nS shares have plummeted 33.8% on a year-to-date basis and could fall even further as competition in the cybersecurity space intensifies, ultimately making SentinelOne a growth stock to sell in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo on a phone screen on a blue background. Phone is in a little cart and there are packages around them. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) is small e-commerce marketplace that connects artisans and entrepreneurs with various consumers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and continental Europe. This is another platform that experienced jaw-breaking top-line growth during the pandemic years but shortly dissipated as inflation surged and interest rates became elevated.\n\nDespite inflation having largely decreased from its 2022 highs, Etsy\u2019s business has not seen any significant resurgence. For the retailer\u2019s first quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024, revenue came in at $645.95 million, which represented year-over-year growth of barely 1%. The Etsy marketplace gross merchandise value, a measure of the value of goods bought on the platform, also decreased 5.3% year-over-year to $2.6 billion.\n\nIn the earnings report, CEO Josh Silverman wrote, \u201cOur first quarter performance, while in line with our guidance, was pressured by the challenging environment for consumer discretionary products, which continues to be a headwind to Etsy marketplace growth.\u201d That is all to say, as consumer discretionary spending remains muted, Etsy\u2019s growth headwinds will remain intact.\n\nETSY\u2019s share price has fallen 28.8% since the start of the year.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nAnother company targeting consumers is Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). The company offers CELSIUS, a fitness drink or supplement designed to accelerate metabolism and burn body fat. Celsius has enjoyed phenomenal financial results over the past few years. In 2023, the energy drink company grew revenue 101.6% to $1.3 billion. Last year, also counted as Celsius Holdings\u2019 first sizable net profit, which amounted to $226.8 million.\n\nUnfortunately, the glamor has not lasted much into 2024. Celsius\u2019s first quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024 saw revenues come under Wall Street analysts\u2019 estimates. Moreover, recent Nielsen retail data suggested Celsius might be losing its growth momentum to competitors. If subsequent data reports confirm this, CELH will definitely see its shares fall even further. Before the news broke, CELH had risen 74.5% for the year, but now the energy drinker maker\u2019s share price has risen just 16.1%, trailing the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Unpacking Q1 Earnings: Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) In The Context Of Other Beverages and Alcohol Stocks\n\nQuarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company\u2019s progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) and the best and worst performers in the beverages and alcohol industry.\n\nThese companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the explosion of alcoholic craft beer drinks or the steady decline of non-alcoholic sugary sodas. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.\n\nThe 13 beverages and alcohol stocks we track reported a decent Q1; on average, revenues were in line with analyst consensus estimates. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 15.8% below consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation.

        "title": "Rags to Riches: 3 High-Risk Stocks That Could Make Early Investors Rich",
        "content": "A lot of great stocks are hiding in plain sight. Many stocks quietly outperform the market without generating much, if any, media attention. Oftentimes, these high-risk stocks are prone to volatility and big swings in their share price. Investors who have a high risk tolerance and are willing to be patient can earn a good return on these more risky investments.\n\nSometimes it is smaller volatile stocks that end up being multibaggers and lead to shareholders getting rich. Consider energy drink company Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). Twenty years ago, its stock was trading for 34 cents a share. Today, the share price is just under $50. That\u2019s a gain of 14,000%. Two decades ago, most analysts dismissed Monster Beverage as a small company with a niche product and a risky stock. Taking a chance on certain high-risk stocks can pay off over time.\n\nHere is rag to riches: three high-risk stocks that could make early investors rich.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIron Mountain (IRM) Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truck\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) servers, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) tends to get all the attention. But another company capitalizing on the opportunity with AI servers is Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM). The company is structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT) and is mostly focused on data storage, back-up and recovery services, as well as records management.\n\nHowever, Iron Mountain is also pushing into the AI server sector. Through an initiative called \u201cProject Matterhorn\u201d that was launched in 2022, the company is investing heavily in the development of data centers and servers to meet the AI needs of other companies. To that end, Iron Mountain has leased 124 megawatts of data center capacity. As for IRM stock, it has risen 60% in the last year, including a 29% gain so far in 2024.\n\nIron Mountain stock is not without risks. It\u2019s currently at a 52-week high and has an exorbitant valuation, trading at 135 times future earnings estimates. Company insiders have also been offloading the stock lately. It does pay a generous quarterly dividend of 65 cents per share, giving it a yield of nearly 3%.\n\nHawkins (HWKN) Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipes\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHawkins (NASDAQ:HWKN) is a relatively small company based outside Minneapolis that specializes in chemicals. Its diversified chemical products are used for everything from ensuring clean drinking water and adding flavor to food to developing health supplements and pharmaceutical medications. The company has been in business since 1938 and today has operations in 27 states and nearly 1,000 employees.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, Hawkins remains a small company with less than $1 billion in annual revenues and a market capitalization below $2 billion. Still, the essential nature of its products has led HWKN stock to outperform the broader market. The company\u2019s share price has risen 350% over the last five years, is up 82% in the past 12 months, and has gained nearly 30% so far in 2024. The company also pays a quarterly dividend of 16 cents per share, which it regularly increases. This is the type of small-cap stock that might be worth the risk.\n\nCelsius (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background. High-Risk Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA buying opportunity might have opened up in Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH). The energy drink company\u2019s stock has plunged 34% over the past month and is trading nearly 40% below its 52-week high. The decline in CELH stock is due to concerns that the company\u2019s rapid growth is beginning to slow. Sales figures show that Celsius\u2019 energy drinks that are made from natural ingredients such as green tea and ginger have cooled.\n\nAnalysts are calling the steep drop in CELH stock during the last month an overreaction and overdone. Piper Sandler just reiterated a $90 price target and \u201cbuy\u201d rating on CELH stock. The $90 price target implies 43% upside for Celsius\u2019 shares. While sales of the energy drinks have slowed, analysts point out that they\u2019re still growing at a 40% year-over-year clip, which is very strong.\n\nDespite the recent volatility, CELH stock remains one of the best performers of the past five years, having gained 4,805% since 2019.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Celsius Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "By disrupting the energy drink duopoly owned by Red Bull and Monster, functional energy drink upstart Celsius(NASDAQ: CELH) has grown to account for 11.5% of its industry's U.S. sales -- becoming the only new brand to reach this mark in the last decade.\n\nNow firmly the No. 3 brand in the energy drink space, Celsius is larger than the No. 4 and No. 5 labels combined. It's grown from a mere 3.5% share of its category two years ago to its current double-digit level, and the company has seen its share price more than double since 2022.\n\nNow, with the company's share price down 35% over the last month due to short-term worries, the time looks right to buy Celsius, thanks to these four key reasons.\n\n1. Celsius is unlocking new opportunities with PepsiCo\n\nAfter signing a massive agreement with beverage giant PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) in 2022, Celsius finally gained the distribution heft it needed to launch its sales into full hypergrowth mode. It averaged triple-digit sales growth in the two years following the deal. The company has picked most of the low-hanging fruit after joining PepsiCo's network. However, there should be plenty of growth remaining in this distribution agreement.\n\nFirst, building upon its land-and-expand strategy, Celsius now looks to execute the \"expand\" portion of this game plan by growing the display space it has in all the new stores it recently entered with PepsiCo's help. In highlighting this point in its first-quarter 2024 earnings press release, management explained: \"We estimate that retailers' spring shelf resets were approximately one-third complete as of March 31st, and once concluded, we are expecting our best shelf space gains in company history.\"\n\nAt an investor conference on June 11, CEO John Fieldy explained that labor shortages have led to delays on these shelf resets, but that gains should be evident over the summer and fall quarters.\n\nSecond, partnering with PepsiCo has opened Celsius up to the food service channel. Case volume for this vertical grew by 186% in Q1 and already accounts for 12% of Celsius' total sales made to PepsiCo. Not only will this burgeoning channel bring sales growth, but it should also increase brand awareness for Celsius drinks as they continue to become more common across a broader array of locations. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Top-notch margins\n\nWhat makes Celsius' incredible sales growth over the last few years all the more impressive is that it already boasts a 19% net profit margin. While this profitability is relatively new, with the company only breaking even in 2023, it already ranks favorably compared to some of its massive beverage peers -- an incredible feat considering the company's rapid growth.\n\nStory continues CELH Profit Margin Chart\n\nThis robust net profit margin is a promising sign for shareholders, as high profitability tends to indicate pricing power for brands with loyal customer bases.\n\nIn addition, reaching profitability means that Celsius is now self-sufficient regarding its growth and will have excess cash to spend on potentially rewarding shareholders or expanding internationally.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\n3. International growth ambitions just starting\n\nAfter signing several distribution agreements with Japanese beverage giant Suntory early in 2024, Celsius plans to expand into Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland, and France. Similarly, the company recently started selling in Canada after expanding its distribution agreement with PepsiCo.\n\nWith international sales only accounting for 5% of the company's total revenue, these foreign markets could represent the next chapter of the Celsius growth story. To put the length of this growth runway for Celsius in perspective, consider that energy drink peer Monster generated 37% of its total sales from international markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company generated $16 million in international sales in its latest quarter, compared to Monster's $637 million. Celsius could have decades of growth remaining in front of it should it continue to disrupt the energy drink industry globally.\n\n4. A more reasonable valuation\n\nWith the company's share price down 35% in the last month due to short-term worries about a few weeks of sales data, the time might be right for long-term investors to reconsider adding to their Celsius position. While the company still trades at a lofty 57 times forward earnings, this is much more reasonable than the mid-80s figure it traded at one month ago. CELH PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile this is nearly three times the S&P 500's forward P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio of 21, analysts expect Celsius to grow its bottom line by 40% in 2024, compared to just 9% for the index as a whole.\n\nUltimately, despite its premium valuation, the four factors listed here show that Celsius still has plenty of room to run -- but investors should be ready for a turbulent ride along the way.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Sean McGowan Just Trimmed Price Target for Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks. In this article, we will examine how Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)\u00a0compares to other stocks whose price targets have been recently reduced by analysts.\n\nOn Tuesday, US stock futures remained stable, reflecting investor optimism following a significant rally in the technology sector on Wall Street, which drove the broader market to a new all-time high. This latest surge marks the 30th record peak for the major US benchmark index this year, defying concerns about market breadth and the possibility of prolonged high US interest rates. Across the Atlantic, European equities experienced a robust rebound, reversing previous losses. Market analysts from M&G are suggesting that the current risks in France could present a strategic buying opportunity for investors, particularly those looking to capitalize on temporary market dips.\n\nIn the commodities market, Treasury yields held steady, indicating a cautious stance among investors amidst the mixed economic signals. Meanwhile, crude oil prices experienced a slight decline, whereas copper prices saw a significant increase, reflecting varying demand dynamics across different sectors. Goldman Sachs economists have pointed out that the US labor market might be approaching a critical juncture. Jan Hatzius from Goldman emphasized that any further decrease in labor demand could lead to a reduction in job numbers, not just a decline in job openings. This concern is underscored by recent data showing healthy nonfarm payrolls but rising initial and continuing jobless claims. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker echoed this sentiment, suggesting that the Federal Reserve might consider either two interest rate cuts or none this year, depending on future economic data.\n\nAdding to the financial landscape, a highly reliable technical trading strategy has issued a sell signal for long-term Treasury securities. This strategy, which has maintained a perfect trading record this year, was triggered after BlackRock's bond exchange-traded fund tracking long-term Treasuries surged last Friday. The fund's performance breached what is known as the \u201ctrading envelope,\u201d indicating overbought conditions. As a result, the strategy suggests that traders should sell these securities when they are overbought and buy them when they are oversold.\n\nThe European Union, despite not matching the economic scale of its counterparts in the U.S. and China, aims to strategically challenge them, according to Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition chief. Vestager emphasized in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that the EU has significantly improved its ability to defend against unfair trade practices. She highlighted recent moves, including the imposition of higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports due to findings of substantial unfair subsidies benefiting Chinese manufacturers, potentially undercutting European producers. Vestager stressed that the EU's approach isn't about outspending its rivals but rather strategically allocating resources. She acknowledged that while the EU cannot match the financial clout of China or the U.S., it can invest strategically in areas of common European interest, such as hydrogen, electric batteries, microelectronics, cloud computing, and healthcare. She pointed to a 100 billion euro fund dedicated to advancing these cutting-edge technologies, aiming to leverage public funds to attract private capital where market forces alone might fall short. Amid escalating trade tensions globally, particularly between the U.S. and China, Vestager reiterated the EU's careful stance, seeking to maintain balanced relations with both economic giants while safeguarding its own interests and alliances. She emphasized that the EU's investments in technology and sustainability are not mere imitations of its competitors' strategies but rather tailored to Europe's unique needs and strengths in the global marketplace. Vestager concluded by urging a focus on the EU's agenda rather than comparisons with other regions, asserting that the EU's approach aims to be effective and sustainable in achieving its economic and technological goals.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's recent property support measures have successfully stimulated sales in its major cities, but smaller regions continue to face significant challenges, indicating a prolonged downturn for much of the national real estate market. According to Reuters, on May 17, China lowered mortgage rates and downpayment requirements and directed local governments to purchase unsold apartments to convert them into social housing. This initiative has led to numerous cities easing their housing policies.\n\nData from real estate research firms and interviews with agents reveal that these measures have had a mixed impact. While they have revived demand in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, smaller cities have seen limited improvement. Reports of home price declines further underscore concerns that the property sector's troubles may persist, especially in smaller cities burdened with a higher supply of unsold properties. This excess inventory is keeping buyer sentiment low, prompting calls for additional support from policymakers. Data from the China Index Academy show that the average daily transactions of second-hand homes in Shanghai between May 18 and June 5 were 27.7% higher than in April, and in Beijing, they increased by 8.1%. Meanwhile, new home transactions in these cities declined slightly. Agents reported a surge in inquiries and home viewings, particularly in Shanghai, where one agent noted a tripling of inquiries following a downpayment reduction. Despite these signs of activity in major cities, smaller cities continue to struggle. Jiaozhou, a city with under a million residents, has attempted to stimulate demand by allowing buyers to split downpayments into two installments, but this has had little impact. In Changsha, authorities have urged developers to offer full refunds on deposits if buyers cancel their purchases, hoping to boost buyer confidence. However, local agents report that demand remains weak, with many customers skeptical about the effectiveness of the new policies. Goldman analysts predict that additional easing measures are likely in the coming months, but they caution that these measures might only lead to a slow, L-shaped recovery in the sector over the coming years.\n\nIn our original article we listed 10 companies whose price targets were cut by analysts and ranked them by the change in their market prices. Negative changes signal that the market participants agree with the analysts\u2019 assessment.\n\n03. Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -1.54(-2.57%)\n\nOn June 17, Roth MKM analyst Sean McGowan reiterated a Buy rating for Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) but adjusted the price target downwards from $96 to $87. This decision follows recent downward revisions by several analysts, sparked by PepsiCo Inc.'s inventory reduction affecting Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH). McGowan's adjustment reflects concerns over Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) growth rates potentially slowing more than initially forecasted. Similarly, analysts at TD Cowen, Stifel, Wedbush, Jefferies, and Morgan Stanley have also revised their price targets downward, aligning with the broader sentiment surrounding Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) performance outlook. The stock reacted to the price target cut with a decline of 2.57%, indicating investor response to the revised expectations from analysts.\n\nAlger Mid Cap Growth Fund stated the following regarding Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCelsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) engages in the development, marketing, sale, and distribution of functional drinks and liquid supplements. It also offers post-workout functional energy drinks and protein bars. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after reporting solid fiscal first quarter results, where revenues and earnings beat analyst estimates. The strong quarter was largely attributed to continued partnership success with large global soft drink manufacturers. Moreover, the company signed a partnership with Ferrari racing, emulating the success of other energy drink competitors within F1 racing. Given the encouraging operating results, we continue to believe Celsius is well positioned to potentially capture market share within the large energy and soft drink industry.\u201d\n\nOverall CELH ranks 3rd on our list of the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently trimmed by analysts. You can visit Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks to see the other stocks whose price targets have been recently reduced by analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CELH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the explosion of alcoholic craft beer drinks or the steady decline of non-alcoholic sugary sodas. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes.

        "content": "Professional analysts aren't always right about which stocks to buy or how high those stocks could go. But when there's a strong consensus among them, I don't ignore it.\n\nAfter all, these people became professionals due to their deep knowledge of how businesses and the stock market work. If they widely agree about something, it's worth noting.\n\nThere are many tools that are publicly available to track the opinions of analysts, one of which is TipRanks. For this article, I've found three stocks that most analysts believe investors should buy and could have at least a 25% upside from where they trade today. The three stocks are Academy Sports and Outdoors(NASDAQ: ASO), Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH), and Nice(NASDAQ: NICE). Here's what investors should know about each one.\n\n1. Academy Sports\n\nOf the 16 analysts tracked by TipRanks who cover the company, 12 recommend buying Academy Sports stock, while the other four recommend holding. Their average price target is about $66 per share, or 25% higher than where the stock trades as of this writing. Keep in mind that analysts usually are making a prediction about where a stock will trade around 12 months later when they set price targets.\n\nAcademy Sports' strategy is to operate huge sporting goods stores capable of high sales volume per location, similar to the strategy of Dick's Sporting Goods. The company has a little more than 280 locations right now, but intends to open between 160 and 180 new stores over the next five years.\n\nThis expansion plan should dramatically boost sales for Academy Sports in the coming years. But management is also striving to push its profit margin up to 10%. For perspective, the company's profit margin was a little less than 6% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGiven its strong plans to increase sales and profits, it's no wonder that most analysts who cover the company believe Academy Sports stock is worth buying.\n\n2. Celsius\n\nOf the 10 prominent analysts who track Celsius, eight recommend buying and two recommend holding. And these analysts generally think that its upside is much higher than the upside for Academy Sports. Their consensus price target here is nearly $91 per share, which is about 47% higher than where the stock trades right now.\n\nCelsius' beverages have quickly grown in popularity in recent years, catapulting it to the third-highest market share in the energy drinks niche behind Red Bull and Monster. But one analyst noted that recent sales data suggests its market share had slipped from 12.4% to 12.2%, and the stock subsequently sold off by more than 30%, partly due to this news.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's possible that analysts could trim their price targets for Celsius stock as more of them update their models based on recent sales data. However, they could be missing the forest for the trees. The reality is that this company has gained tremendous market share in recent years, and its recent slip was minuscule. It doesn't seem like something to get worked up about.\n\nMoreover, Celsius generated 95% of its sales from North America in the first quarter. It's just starting to kick its international growth into high gear, and that presents a multiyear growth opportunity. If it achieves a comparable market share in its foreign markets to the market share it has taken domestically, the upside for investors who buy in today could be substantial.\n\n3. Nice\n\nThere are 16 prominent analysts tracking Nice, and they are unanimous: This is a stock to buy. Their average price target is $274 per share, which implies a whopping 57% upside.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest trend in investing. So one might think that Nice is some start-up trying to capitalize on the market's enthusiasm, considering it bills itself as an AI customer-service software company. However, Nice has been a\u00a0publicly traded company for almost 30 years -- it isn't just some obscure start-up. Nonetheless, it still flies under most people's radar.\n\nNice faces plenty of competition in this niche, including from some tech titans. Therefore, it's reasonable to have concerns about its ability to compete. That said, the company already counts 85 of the Fortune 100 among its customers, so it's clearly competing well enough to win business from top-tier clients.\n\nAccording to management, the AI trend is a tailwind for Nice's business. In consequence, it expects 14% to 15% revenue growth this year, compared to just 9% growth in 2023. And it expects to grow its full-year free cash flow by at least 26% to $600 million. Those are strong projections for a stock that has dropped by more than 35% from its 12-month high.\n\nIs there a clear winner?\n\nAcademy Sports, Celsius, and Nice are all stocks with substantial upsides ahead, according to Wall Street analysts. This would suggest that they're all relatively good bargains right now.\n\nHowever, investors shouldn't just take the word of the analysts. They are often wrong, so individuals need to do their own research.\n\nI believe that Academy Sports stock is the best value of these three today. It's profitable already and trades at a really cheap valuation of just 8 times its trailing earnings. Moreover, while nothing is guaranteed, it does have credible plans to grow its profits and revenues substantially by opening new stores and improving operations.\n\nThese plans should give Academy Sports stock a clear path higher. While analysts see about 25% upside potential over the next year, I believe its upside is 100% or more when extending the time horizon out to three to five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Academy Sports And Outdoors right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Academy Sports And Outdoors, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Academy Sports And Outdoors wasn\u2019t one of them.

Shares are down 16.7% for the week at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe energy drink slowdown\n\nTo be clear, there aren't any earnings reports out yet, but investors are looking at market data from third-party analysts that indicate slowing growth for energy drinks. At an industry conference this week, CEO John Fieldly said he thinks the entire energy market would be in decline without Celsius.\n\nWhat investors are struggling with is the right price to pay for Celsius stock. After this week's drop, shares are still trading for more than 10 times sales and 67 times earnings. That's an incredibly high price for a consumer stock, but Celsius has also been a growth engine that's earned a hefty multiple.\n\nWhat to do now\n\nAs a Celsius shareholder who thinks long-term, I'm looking at this pullback as more of a buying opportunity. Shares are still up over the past year and the pop this spring wasn't driven by great results, it was just a trading phenomenon.\n\nWhat I see in the business is still a growth story, although there will be volatility depending on distributor inventory, the speed at which stores reset shelves, and when international expansion takes place. What I'm more worried about are the long-term trends and a company that's still growing over 30% annually is a good bet even at a lofty valuation.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Investors looking for stocks in the Food - Miscellaneous sector might want to consider either Lamb Weston (LW) or Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nLamb Weston and Celsius Holdings Inc. are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that LW is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\n\nLW currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.97, while CELH has a forward P/E of 56.75. We also note that LW has a PEG ratio of 1.26. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 1.75.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for LW is its P/B ratio of 7.08. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CELH has a P/B of 42.38.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, LW holds a Value grade of B, while CELH has a Value grade of D.\n\nLW has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than CELH, so it seems like value investors will conclude that LW is the superior option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investors in Celsius Holdings, Inc. (CELH) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 19, 2024 $35 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Celsius shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Celsius is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Food - Miscellaneous industry that ranks in the Top 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 28 cents per share to 26 cents in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Celsius right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

        "title": "Celsius Stock Has Plunged More Than 30% in Less Than a Month. Time to Buy the Dip?",
        "content": "Roughly twice a year for the last five years, the same thing keeps happening to shares of energy-drink company Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH): Shares drop 20% or more. And as of this writing, Celsius stock is down once again, this time falling more than 30% in just the last few weeks.\n\nFor investors who hate losing money, buying shares of a company that routinely drops 20% or more might seem like a bad idea. However, Celsius stock is also up more than 5,000% total in the last five years, making it one of the greatest five-year stock performances in history. Therefore, it has been a great stock to own despite a fair amount of volatility. CELH Chart\n\nRoutine volatility has struck again. Now it's important to consider if anything is different this time for Celsius and whether this is a dip worth buying.\n\nWhat's the problem this time for Celsius?\n\nCelsius has enjoyed explosive sales growth for years for two reasons. First, the energy-drink space has continued to grow at a nice pace. Second, the company has taken market share at an encouraging rate. These two factors made triple-digit top-line growth customary for the company.\n\nEvercore analyst Robert Ottenstein notes that this isn't necessarily happening right now. In May, the analyst talked about a slowdown in growth for energy drinks, and he pointed out that the company had slipped from 12.4% market share down to 12.2% in recent weeks, according to The Fly. And Ottenstein isn't alone: Many analysts are adjusting their financial models to account for a slowdown in growth for Celsius.\n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily new information for investors. In 2023, Celsius' revenue grew a whopping 102% year over year. But in the first quarter of 2024, revenue was up by only 37%. Therefore, investors already knew that growth was slowing down. Recent commentary from analysts didn't change this narrative.\n\nMoreover, Ottenstein might have noted a minute decline in market share for Celsius. But the analyst's market-share estimate of 12.2% is actually higher than the company's own estimate of 11.4% market share in the first quarter. Therefore, investors could interpret this more optimistically if they wanted to.\n\nIn other words, analysts are spooking investors by pointing out slowing growth for Celsius. But it was already apparent beforehand. Moreover, investors are getting worried that the company is losing market share. Estimates show that any dip is inconsequential, however, and its share is still higher than previous estimates.\n\nAll of this points to an overreaction from investors for the latest decline for Celsius stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat should investors do now?\n\nTo summarize up to this point, Celsius stock is prone to volatility, and it's down more than 30% in recent weeks as investors overreact to commentary regarding its sales growth. Does this make it a stock to buy? Here are two things to consider.\n\nFirst, for investors looking for a good deal, the stock still has a way to go to be a bargain. Looking at things from a price-to-sales (P/S) valuation perspective, Celsius stock has been cheaper several times in recent years and could drop further. Moreover, it still trades at a premium to top rival Monster Beverage. CELH PS Ratio Chart\n\nYou could argue that Celsius stock should trade at a higher P/S valuation than Monster, and that may indeed be so. But it would need to drop further before it could reasonably be called a bargain.\n\nSecond, Celsius could still create significant\u00a0shareholder value from here, so investors shouldn't discount its growth potential when looking at its valuation.\n\nThe most obvious catalyst for growth for Celsius is entry into international markets, where it generated revenue of only $16 million in the first quarter. By comparison, Monster had net sales of over $700 million from international markets during this quarter. That's nearly $3 billion in annual terms.\n\nTop dog Red Bull is privately held, so investors don't have access to those numbers, unfortunately. But they can make educated guesses. According to Celsius, Red Bull had almost 37% market share in the U.S. in the first quarter, which would equate to roughly $1.1 billion. This would mean that Red Bull has about $4.5 billion in U.S. sales annually.\n\nAccording to Red Bull, the company generated around $11 billion in sales in 2023. This would suggest that it's generating north of $6 billion annually in international markets.\n\nEven if Red Bull and Monster stay at the top of the energy drink market internationally, Celsius could still have an opportunity for over $1 billion in sales, given the size of the other two companies.\n\nFor perspective, Celsius generated total annual revenue of over $1 billion for the first time ever in 2023. Therefore, the company could still realistically double its business from here over the long term before its growth even started to hit a ceiling.\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn't buy Celsius stock like it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity after its 30% pullback; it's not, and it could indeed get cheaper. But this business is extraordinary, and its long-term potential is still quite high, so perhaps this 30% pullback is a nice opportunity to pick up some shares for the long term at a better price than last month.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -23.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, which Celsius falls in, has lost 6.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Celsius is expected to post earnings of $0.26 per share, indicating a change of +52.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.11 points to a change of +44.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.45 indicates a change of +30.9% from what Celsius is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Celsius.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CELH _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Celsius, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $425.37 million indicates a year-over-year change of +30.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.72 billion and $2.18 billion estimates indicate +30.2% and +26.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCelsius reported revenues of $355.71 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.8%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.13 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $388.87 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -8.53%. The EPS surprise was +35%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCelsius is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Celsius. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Refreshing Returns: 3 Beverage Stocks to Quench Your Thirst for Profits",
        "content": "When most people hear the term \u201cbeverage stocks,\u201d they probably picture rather ancient, slow-growing staples like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi (NYSE:PEP). But beverage companies can actually expand extremely quickly.\n\nEnergy drink maker Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), soared from $3.40 in February 2010 to $46.50 in May 2021 while Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE:TAP) jumped from $32.65 in September 2020 to $70.55 in July 2023. Meanwhile, even Warren Buffett is a believer in beverage stocks, as shown by his significant, longtime stake in Coca-Cola. In fact, the Oracle owns 400 million shares of the soda maker and has owned the company\u2019s stock since way back in 1988.\n\nHere are three beverage stocks that are well-positioned to produce big returns for investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVita Coco (COCO) A line of Vita Coco (COCO) waters on a shelf.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nVita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO) beverages are fairly healthy as they are based on coconut water. According to Healthline, coconut water is \u201cnaturally sweet and hydrating,\u201d while it is also \u201cloaded with several important nutrients, including minerals that many people don\u2019t get enough of.\u201d And unlike coconut milk, coconut water contains very little fat. Additionally, several studies show the beverage could be more efficient than water when it comes to helping people recover from exercise sessions. Vita Coco heavily utilizes the latter aspect of the liquid in its marketing campaigns.\n\nThose efforts are bearing some fruit (no pun intended) as the company\u2019s top line jumped to $493.6 million last quarter last year from $427.8 million in 2022. Moreover, its operating income soared over five times to $56.9 million in 2023 from $10.4 million in 2022. Meanwhile, analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to advance to 94 cents this year from 79 cents in 2023.\n\nLarge investors also appear to be warming up to the name as COCO stock climbed 22% from Apr. 22 to Jun. 4.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI view Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) as having found a \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of sorts because its beverages are healthy, don\u2019t use artificial sweeteners, have very few calories, taste rather good and provide a tremendous amount of energy via caffeine.\n\nIts products include large amounts of important vitamins. For example, its Live Fit offerings have 90% of the FDA\u2019s Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for Vitamin C, 130% ofor Riboflavin, and 120% for B6.\n\nLast quarter the company\u2019s revenue jumped 37% versus the same period a year earlier. That growth enabled its top line to reach $355.7 million. Further, its earnings per share more than doubled year-over-year to 27 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nLately, the Street has shunned its shares, largely because its growth has slowed slightly, according to Nielsen. But retail demand for the company\u2019s product is increasing and the placement of its beverages is improving. Also importantly, Celsius is in the process of expanding to multiple, significant overseas markets.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) sign on the front of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAccording to Beverage Digest, Dr Pepper last year overtook Pepsi to become America\u2019s second favorite soft drink. Specifically, Dr Pepper and Pepsi both commanded 8.3% of the soft drink market in 2023, with Dr Pepper holding a slight edge. Buffett\u2019s Coca Cola remained way ahead of both of the other two firms with a 19.2% share.\n\nThe news is certainly positive for Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) which, of course, manufactures and markets Dr Pepper. The data suggests the company is doing a very good job of marketing its soda. What\u2019s more, the news itself has given the company a great deal of free publicity.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on CNBC\u2019s Halftime Report on Jun. 4, Jenny\u00a0Van Leeuwen Harrington, the CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management, said the new weight loss drugs could cause consumers to cut back on Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Keurig pods. But I believe that the opposite could very well be true. That\u2019s because as consumers drink fewer sugary drinks that give them energy, they could turn more to low-calorie coffees to obtain energy instead.\n\nAlthough consumers on the weight loss drug are likely to drink less regular Dr Pepper, many are likely to switch to Diet Dr Pepper instead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in CELH. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "Retail stocks are never seen as compounders that can provide outsized returns. Of course, that narrative has changed this year with the performance of Abercrombie and Fitch (NYSE:ANF). Over the past year, ANF has returned more than 440%.\n\nOf course, not all retail stocks will provide you with these returns. But just like any other sector, choosing winners can provide incredible growth for your portfolio. These three retail stocks offer very different products and services to consumers. What do they have in common? Their stocks are steadily moving higher and to the right on their charts. Check out these three retail stocks to buy that could be the next Abercrombie and Fitch.\n\nCelsius (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is an American energy drink maker looking to expand into international markets. Wall Street thinks highly of the stock, as analysts have a one-year average price target of $94.23 and a street-high target of $110, which indicates the potential for a 40% upside from the current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhy has Celsius done so well? It has a variety of different products that target different audiences. For the most part, the consensus is that Celsius beverages taste better than most other energy drinks. Its distribution partnership with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has allowed it to sell at major retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Celsius is eyeing an expansion into Europe and other international markets over the next couple of years.\n\nStocks with impressive growth tend to trade at higher valuations. The company has a five-year revenue CAGR of 91% and a ten-year CAGR of 71%. Its gross margin of 50% is easily higher than the industry average of 38%, showing how efficiently Celsius runs. Shares trade at 72x forward earnings but just 13x sales. These are high for a retail stock, but the growth rates of Celsius speak louder than those of its multiples.\n\nOn Holdings (ONON) A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.\n\nSource: It for you / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Holdings (NASDAQ:ONON) is a Swiss running shoes and apparel maker founded by former Swiss Ironman Champion Olivier Bernhard. Of the 21 analyst ratings it received in May, 16 were a Buy or Strong Buy. The street-high analyst price target is $55.18, more than 30% higher than the current price.\n\nOn is looking to disrupt the industry with its CloudTec technology, which has garnered a strong following of running enthusiasts and will be used by multiple athletes in the upcoming Paris Summer Olympic Games. On is also taking a chunk of the tennis apparel market with sponsor athletes like Roger Federer and world number one Iga Swiatek.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Celsius, On commands a high price multiple due to its revenue growth and strong gross margin. On\u2019s gross margin of 60% is double the industry average of 30.1%, which also shows the pricing power that the company has for its products. Shares of ONON trade at 13x sales and 45x forward earnings after rising by nearly 60% in 2024. With a strong presence at the Olympic Games, On can capture an even larger market share.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market\u2019s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is a membership-based retail chain that follows the big-box wholesale model. As of June 2024, Costco is the 24th-largest company in the world by market capitalization. Analysts remain bullish on the stock even after returning 60% over the past year. It has a one-year price target range of $650 to $940, which implies the potential for about 15% more upside.\n\nThe most important part of Costco\u2019s business is its memberships. As of 2023, Costco had more than 130 million active members worldwide. Why is this important? In 2024, Costco announced it was raising the price of memberships, cracking down on shared memberships, and requiring a membership to purchase food from its food court. This pricing power and recurring revenue show why Costco\u2019s membership is so vital to the company\u2019s success.\n\nAlthough shares are over $800 now, they trade at just 1.4x sales and 46.5x forward earnings. For a business this size, to grow net income at a ten-year CAGR of 14% is impressive and part of the reason you are paying a high multiple for the stock. At its current price, don\u2019t rule out an imminent stock split and potentially even an addition to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When investors buy stocks on weakness, they purchase securities on dips in the hope that the equities will rebound in the future. Investors try to execute this strategy with names whose pullbacks are overdone or, better yet, completely unjustified.\n\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out in past columns, buying stocks on weakness is a way of starting to execute the \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d strategy that is often the key to successful investing. After all, stocks that have dropped meaningfully on price are much more likely to be towards the low end of their valuation ranges than names which have recently surged.\n\nTo see how a successful buy-on-weakness strategy could work, consider that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock had tumbled to $762 on April 19. At that time, many on the Street were worried that the stock\u2019s valuation was excessive and that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom would prove to be fleeting. Investors who thought such fears were overdone and purchased the shares on weakness would be looking at a 32% gain as of the market close on May 31.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor investors who want to exploit similar opportunities, here are three top-notch stocks to buy on weakness.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH)\n\nThe shares of up-and-coming energy drink maker Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) slumped over 15% from May 24 to May 31. The decline was ostensibly due to a small downturn in the company\u2019s market share and a slowdown in its rapid growth recently reported by Nielsen. Specifically, Celsius\u2019 market share dropped to 10.5% from 10.8% while its sales growth fell to a still-blistering pace of 39%.\n\nBut even Morgan Stanley, which was cautious about the outlook of CELH stock in the near-term, admitted the firm has multiple, positive catalysts including improved placement of its offerings at retailers and increased demand for its beverages by retailers. Moreover, the company is expanding to new overseas markets.\n\nThe investment firm warned the beverage maker is facing tougher comparisons which could cause its growth data to slide. But investment bank Wedbush called the decline \u201can overreaction.\u201d\n\nGiven the company\u2019s incredibly strong growth and powerful, positive catalysts, I agree with the latter sentiment.\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nGiant chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has fallen sharply in recent months as its shares sank 33% between Mar. 7 and May 31. The Street was displeased with the company\u2019s Q1 results in general and its Q2 guidance in particular.\n\nBut the company\u2019s top line increased 8.5% in the first quarter versus the same period a year earlier as sales of its client computing unit soared 31% year-over-year. Moreover, Intel generated earnings per share of 14 cents last quarter, well above analysts\u2019 mean outlook of 10 cents. As a result, I believe that Intel\u2019s Q2 data could easily beat its guidance.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Intel\u2019s share of the PC market increased by about three percentage points to 63% last quarter, and the company\u2019s top and bottom lines are likely to be boosted over the longer term by the initial demand for AI PCs.\n\nFinally, according to some sources, the company\u2019s Gaudi 3 AI chip is actually faster than Nvidia\u2019s current offerings. Gaudi is certainly cheaper and less supply-constrained than Nvidia\u2019s chips.\n\nGiven these points, I view Intel as one of the best stocks to buy on weakness.\n\nLuckin Coffee (LKNCY)\n\nIn recent quarters, China-based LuckinCoffee (OTC:LKNCY) has been the victim of tough competition from domestic rival Cotti Coffee. Launched by Luckin\u2019s deposed former chairman and its former CEO, Cotti has relied on a franchise model to open 6,200 stores and engage in a price war with Luckin. Largely as a result of Cotti\u2019s high number of stores and its price war, Luckin generated an operating loss of 65.1 yuan (or $9 million) last quarter. Last year it had operating income of 678 million yuan.\n\nBut the competition from Cotti is likely to fade sharply in the medium term. That\u2019s because the low prices it is charging appear to be unsustainable for its franchisees. Indeed, reportedly only about 20% to 30% of them are currently profitable and at least 40% are losing money. As a result, it\u2019s not surprising that 826 of Cotti\u2019s shops reportedly closed between November 2023 and February 2024.\n\nGiven these points, I expect Cotti to either have to close many shops or raise its prices going forward. In either scenario, Luckin will be able to raise its prices, boosting its top and bottom lines.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in INTC and CELH.

        "content": "Wall Street actually largely ignores and tremendously underestimates great stocks fairly frequently. And the phenomenon has become even more widespread than usual over the past few years. That\u2019s because most large investors believe that the vast majority of small and medium companies are in great danger of failing due to today\u2019s relatively high interest rates.\n\nBut today\u2019s interest rates are actually not that high from a historical perspective. And it\u2019s clear that great small-and-medium companies can indeed thrive despite the elevated rates.\n\nAmong the companies in the latter category whose stocks have risen tremendously (after being largely ignored and greatly underestimated by the Street) are Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH), Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI), and Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS). Here are three largely undiscovered stocks that are poised to follow the same path over the longer term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmerican Superconductor (AMSC) a close up image of a semiconductor. 5X Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Superconductor\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMSC) products are used to regulate electrical currents and manage wind turbines. Additionally, the company develops products used by the U.S. Navy to evade and detect mines.\n\nIn-line with my previous predictions, the company reported very strong fiscal fourth-quarter results on May 29. Specifically, its top line jumped to $42 million last quarter versus $31.74 million during the same period a year earlier. Further, its operating activities generated $2.14 million of cash, versus cash burn from operating activities of $22.5 million in Q4 of 2023.\n\nIn my previous assessment of AMSC stock, I predicted that the company would likely benefit from the success of its partner, Indian wind energy developer Inox Wind. That appears to have been the case, as the revenue generated by American Superconductor\u2019s wind unit more than doubled year-over-year to $7.8 million last quarter.\n\nGoing forward, I expect American Superconductor to continue to be boosted by Inox\u2019s strong growth. Moreover, the U.S. firm also obtains a significant amount of its revenue from chipmakers, so it should benefit from the rapid growth of chip manufacturing in America.\n\nFinally, the firm obtains a meaningful amount of its revenue from utilities. With utilities building many new power plants to satisfy the increasing demand for electricity, American Superconductor is well-positioned to get a meaningful lift from the latter phenomenon.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, \u201cSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) provides industrial robots that are autonomous and powered by its proprietary AI software.\u201d The company\u2019s robots are primarily currently used in warehouses, and it has signed up multiple, huge customers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Target (NYSE:TGT) .\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the ongoing labor shortages in the U.S. and the continued enhancements in robots\u2019 capabilities enabled by AI, I predict that Symbotic will grow tremendously going forward.\n\nIndeed, the firm is already delivering strong growth as its sales surged 59% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $424 million. And for the current quarter, the firm expects to generate EBITDA, excluding certain items, of $27 to $29 million. The latter outlook indicates that the company is moving rapidly towards overall profitability.\n\nGiven these points, I view Symbotic as one of the best largely undiscovered stocks to buy at this point.\n\nGE Vernova (GEV) Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.\n\nSource: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nGE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) sells parts used in power plants and electrical grids. The company also markets wind turbines.\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated previously, \u2018the firm is very well-positioned to get a big lift from the rapidly rising demand of electricity going forward.\n\nThe Street is starting to catch onto this story, but it is still greatly underestimating GEV stock. As evidence of that point, consider that Morgan Stanley recently initiated coverage of the name with a lukewarm \u201cequal weight\u201d rating, even though it concedes that the firm will benefit from \u201cgrowing electricity demand, power grid reliability and the need to slash carbon emissions\u201d going forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in AMSC,GEV,CELH, and SMCI.

        "content": "The economy faces uncertainty due to decreased consumer spending and a slowing job market. The impact of raising interest rates 11 times from 2022 to 2023 is seen through consumer spending, which saw 0% growth from March to April and a 0.1% decrease when excluding gas and vehicle sales. These statistics don\u2019t account for inflation, meaning real consumer spending has further decreased. Retail analyst Claire Tassin observes signs of a \u201cretail pullback\u201d from consumer surveys. A continued lack of entry-level jobs is expected to raise unemployment rates. If these trends continue, economic output will suffer, making these the prime stocks to sell.\n\nBoeing (BA) Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logo.\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) is an aerospace company that develops and manufactures commercial airplanes, defense products and space systems for over 150 countries. The company has recently come under fire after two whistleblowers were found dead.\n\nBoeing does not show promising financials either. The company missed revenue analyst predictions by 2.42% on its Q1 2024 earnings call, and revenue is down 7.54% YOY. Profitability has taken a significant hit, as seen in a free cash flow reaching -$3.52 billion, and will suffer further.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Brian West states that the plane delivery backlog grew to $448 billion and includes over 5600 airplanes on the Q1 earnings call. Morningstar analysts\u00a0 have predicted that at 2023 production rates it will take more than 11 years for Boeing to fulfill all of these orders, hurting the company\u2019s bottom line for the foreseeable future. Additionally, a recent incident wherein a door on an Alaska Airlines flight flew off has caused the FAA to limit Boeing\u2019s its rate of production to 38 a month. With a bad long-term outlook, I would advise Boeing to be in your list of stocks to sell.\n\nTarget (TGT) an image of bullseye the target dog in a target store\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nTarget (NYSE:TGT) is a large scale American retail company with over 1,900 locations nationwide. Slowing consumer spending nationwide from inflationary pressures negatively affects all retail stores \u2014 but why did I choose Target specifically?\n\nTarget does not show promising financials, falling in line with the predictions on future retail spending stated above. Revenue is down 3.12% YOY, and Target has reported misses on analyst earning expectations for both revenue and earnings per share. A 12.96% decline in cash from operations indicates that management is not able to offset revenue losses either.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter initially stating plans to roll out express self-checkout to most of its locations nationwide, Target has switched back to traditional lane service only at some locations. Target has allegedly made this decision to combat shoplifting. Self-checkout kiosks would lower Target\u2019s operational costs, however, these kiosks can lead to increased prevalence of shoplifting, causing some Target locations to be shut down. Changes to traditional lane service can discourage consumers, as checkout takes longer. When combined with inflationary price pressures, this increased wait time could encourage consumers to choose other retailers over Target. Investors should choose Target as one of the stocks to sell for these reasons.\n\nCelsius (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius (NASDAQ:CELH) is a global beverage company, specializing in energy drinks. The global beverage and energy drink markets demonstrates great indicators of long-term growth. Unfortunately, Celcius will not be included in this.\n\nCelsius showcases amazing financials, with a 36.84% YOY increase in revenue and 27.38% increase in assets. This asset outpaces its 25.01% YOY growth in liabilities, showing good financial health with regards to the company balance sheet. However, the issues with this stock do not stem from its financials.\n\nDespite strong growth potential with an 8.4% CAGR, the energy drink market has been volatile with respect to industry leaders. Originally dominated by Monster Energy (NASDAQ:MNST) and Redbull, the market saw competition from Vital Pharmaceuticals from 2020 to 2022. Bang Energy\u2019s downfall came after false advertising litigation from Monster over \u201csuper creatine\u201d healing property claims, leading to bankruptcy and Monster\u2019s acquisition of Vital Pharmaceuticals. Similarly, Celsius now faces a class action lawsuit for misbranding and selling drinks without FDA approval, threatening its reputation. Due to these uncertainties and the lawsuit, I consider Celsius a stock to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues held no positions in stocks mentioned in this article.

It\u2019s important to approach retirement plans knowing these facts.\n\nUnderstanding this context can inspire you to build your retirement portfolio\u00a0at a faster pace\u00a0and stay sharp with your financial habits. It can also be incredibly satisfying once you\u00a0build\u00a0up a retirement portfolio despite elevated living costs.\n\nWhile investors can take many approaches with their retirement portfolios, these picks are geared for high returns rather than blue-chip picks that offer high yields.

Consumers are willing to pay a premium for Chipotle\u2019s meals due to its healthier options.\u00a0Fast food\u00a0restaurants that sell unhealthy food are having a more difficult time gaining market share as companies like Chipotle continue to thrive.\n\nThe fast food restaurant chain reported 14.1% YOY revenue growth in\u00a0Q1 2024.

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Food - Miscellaneous stocks have likely encountered both Ingredion (INGR) and Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Ingredion has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Celsius Holdings Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that INGR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CELH has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\n\nINGR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.94, while CELH has a forward P/E of 74.65. We also note that INGR has a PEG ratio of 1.09. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 2.32.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for INGR is its P/B ratio of 2.04. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CELH has a P/B of 56.64.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, INGR holds a Value grade of A, while CELH has a Value grade of D.\n\nINGR stands above CELH thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that INGR is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +16.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, which Celsius falls in, has lost 2.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nCelsius is expected to post earnings of $0.26 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +52.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +44.2%. This estimate has changed +1.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.46 indicates a change of +31.4% from what Celsius is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Celsius is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CELH _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Celsius, the consensus sales estimate of $427.32 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +31.1%. The $1.72 billion and $2.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +30.6% and +26.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCelsius reported revenues of $355.71 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.8%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.13 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $388.87 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -8.53%. The EPS surprise was +35%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCelsius is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Celsius. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Institutional investors in Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) lost 14% last week but have reaped the benefits of longer-term growth",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Celsius Holdings implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price The top 10 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have been selling lately\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 65% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nInstitutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$22b last week. However, the 100% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Celsius Holdings, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Celsius Holdings  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Celsius Holdings?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Celsius Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Celsius Holdings' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Celsius Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Estate Of Carl Desantis, with ownership of 10%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.2% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nWe did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Celsius Holdings\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nWe can see that insiders own shares in Celsius Holdings, Inc.. Insiders own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nIt seems that Private Companies own 15%, of the Celsius Holdings stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the  2 warning signs  we've spotted with Celsius Holdings .\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Anyone growing their portfolio at 20% per year would have\u00a0to significantly outperform the Nasdaq.\u00a0It\u00a0would\u00a0also\u00a0mean\u00a0doubling your money every 3.6 years.\n\nHowever, such a task isn\u2019t impossible. I have highlighted the above metrics to clarify that even if you invest in\u00a0very good\u00a0companies, it would\u00a0be difficult\u00a0to consistently achieve 20% annual portfolio growth.\u00a0You\u00a0also need to invest in more than just growth stocks for a well-rounded portfolio.\n\nRegardless, there are some stocks that can help you achieve those returns. These quality growth stocks are likely to compound around 20% annually going forward, as long as the market holds\u00a0up\u00a0their premium valuations.\u00a0A portfolio consisting only of these seven stocks will likely yield significant gains. That\u2019s as long as the rally continues.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI would still recommend you invest in defensive and dividend stocks alongside high CAGR stocks for ballast. That said, investors looking for outsized gains may want to dive into these stocks right now!\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage. Focus on cellphone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) makes equipment to support law enforcement and public safety personnel. Its tasers are very well-known, and as social disorder increases, I see much more demand from law enforcement agencies in the coming years. Looking at the stock\u2019s recent performance, and it becomes clear it is one of the best high CAGR stocks to buy right now. High CAGR stocks: AXON segments\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIn fact,\u00a0the demand for its products so far has been stellar. I\u2019m very optimistic about where Axon\u00a0is headed\u00a0after the company reported their strong financial results for Q1 2024.\u00a0Revenue increased 34% to $461 million, blowing past analysts\u2019 estimates by more than $19 million. Earnings per share came in at $1.15, which also significantly exceeded projections.\n\nBeyond the impressive headline numbers, I\u2019m excited about some of Axon\u2019s transformational projects that could truly be game-changers in their industry. Their planned acquisition of Dedrone aims to enable law enforcement agencies to deploy drones for emergency response in a big way while overcoming current limitations set by the FAA.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Axon\u2019s new AI-assisted software, Draft One, also shows tremendous potential to save officers around 15 hours\u00a0each week\u00a0on paperwork and administrative tasks.\u00a0That freed-up time could be reallocated\u00a0to valuable community engagement and professional development work.\n\nI think\u00a0Axon has the potential for some\u00a0truly\u00a0massive growth over the long-term.\u00a0Axon appears well-positioned to deliver\u00a0strong\u00a0returns for investors seeking high annual returns of 20% or more. Analysts expect the top and bottom lines to grow around 20% annually over the coming years. So as long as the market premium holds, AXON stock should perform just fine.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is an up-and-coming beverage company.\u00a0This company also reported outstanding first-quarter results, with revenue soaring 37%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0to a record $355.7 million.\u00a0Notably, Celsius is among the key contributors to the impressive 47% growth seen in the entire energy drink segment. That\u2019s because the company\u2019s market share climbed to 11.5%, up\u00a0a full\u00a0point.\n\nWhile temporary fluctuations at their largest distributor created some noise, the underlying demand pattern remains robust. Celsius is executing and innovating well, with promising new introductions like Galaxy Vibe and the CELSIUS Essentials line gaining traction. Management also highlighted that they expect their best product placement gains once spring resets fully roll out to stores.\n\nIn my view,\u00a0Celsius has significant potential for growth\u00a0ahead\u00a0as the company works towards its ambitious goal of becoming the world\u2019s top energy drink brand.\u00a0That will take time to materialize, but you can ride the growth\u00a0in the meantime. You\u2019re\u00a0definitely\u00a0paying a premium for this stock, but as long as the company executes and Wall Street holds up the premium, this is a stock that can deliver 20%-plus annual gains.

This stock has been one of the most flashiest names in the market recently. Notably, HWM stock is up by nearly 95% in the past year, and I think it fits the bill among high CAGR stocks with the potential to see this trend continue.\n\nI\u2019m very optimistic about Howmet\u2019s\u00a0future\u00a0prospects. The company\u2019s\u00a0revenue hit a record high of $1.82 billion, up\u00a0an impressive\u00a014% from last year. The remarkable 23% growth in the company\u2019s commercial aerospace segment was especially notable. Private and commercial aerospace are areas that are booming, and will continue to boom, due to Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which allow these jets to\u00a0be written off\u00a0as business expenses.\n\nBut what\u00a0really\u00a0caught my eye was the stunning 21% jump in EBITDA and 150 basis point margin expansion seen this past quarter.\u00a0This company\u00a0seems to be\u00a0performing exceptionally well across the board.\n\nManagement has done a flawless job, with 12 straight quarters of robust gains in aerospace supplemented by\u00a0smart\u00a0decisions to increase their transportation market share. The company\u2019s financial position is\u00a0incredibly strong, with the ratio of their net debt to EBITDA at a record low of only 2 to 1.\u00a0It\u2019s clear that\u00a0Howmet\u2019s excellent operational execution also translates to the bottom line, as earnings per share grew 36%. The company is also deleveraging fast and could become a cash cow.\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nGiven the outstanding first-quarter results and various tailwinds from the rebound in air travel,\u00a0I believe\u00a0Howmet is well-positioned to deliver 20% annual returns.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) operates a leading online marketplace in China and abroad. You likely have heard of Temu and their bargain prices. Temu is now one of the most downloaded apps on the App Store.\n\nI\u2019m very impressed by the company\u2019s strong results reported last quarter, with revenue increasing\u00a0an incredible 131% over the same period last year to\u00a0reach 86.8 billion yuan ($11.99 billion), handily surpassing analysts\u2019 projections by $1.41 billion. This is definitely one of the most high CAGR stocks in the market right now. Analysts are bullish in their near-term projections, too. PDD stock price target\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nPDD is wisely dedicating resources to offering\u00a0more selection to shoppers, partnering with top global brands, and providing merchants with digital tools to help lower costs.\u00a0This balanced approach should support continued growth as Chinese consumers increasingly demand higher-end goods.\n\nPlexus (PLXS) Industrial stocks to buy: a person wearing a hard hat and holding a tablet while standing in front of a machine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPlexus Corp. (NASDAQ:PLXS) provides design, manufacturing, and aftermarket services to companies in the industrial, healthcare/life sciences, aerospace/defense, and communications markets.\u00a0This stock has consistently delivered returns\u00a0that are\u00a0around 20% annually on average. In fact, the stock\u00a0is\u00a0up over 128% over the past five years, and I think\u00a0it is possible for Plexus to\u00a0repeat this performance.\n\nThe company\u2019s fiscal Q2 results were impressive, with Plexus reporting revenue of $967 million and non-GAAP EPS of 94 cents\u00a0that beat\u00a0expectations. Management\u2019s go-to-market strategy is\u00a0clearly\u00a0paying off, with $255 million in new program wins signaling robust demand and market share gains.\n\nThe company now\u00a0seems focused\u00a0on expanding margins, with a target of 5.5% GAAP operating margin (over 6% non-GAAP) by late fiscal 2025.\u00a0Initiatives to align operations and control costs are taking hold. Plexus also flexed its cash generation muscle this quarter, producing $65 million in free cash flow. I see lots of room for margins to expand. How Plexus makes its money\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nGiven management\u2019s increased fiscal 2024 FCF forecast of $100 million and plans to return excess cash to shareholders, I believe Plexus is well-positioned to deliver outsized returns. This under-the-radar mid-cap is worth a closer look for growth-oriented portfolios.\n\nManhattan Associates (MANH) cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nManhattan Associates (NASDAQ:MANH) provides cloud-based supply chain and online shopping solutions to many companies. The company is off to a great start in 2024, with first-quarter revenue growing 15% to $255 million and adjusted earnings per share surging 29% to $1.03,\u00a0both\u00a0beating analyst estimates. I\u2019m\u00a0especially\u00a0impressed by the 36% growth in cloud revenue and 14%\u00a0growth\u00a0in services revenue, which helped drive the higher-than-expected total revenue number this past quarter. The top line beat expectations by 4.6%, while earnings beat by 18.4%.\n\nEven with uncertainty in the global economy, Manhattan\u2019s underlying business fundamentals remain strong. The company\u2019s backlog increased 31% to over $1.5 billion due to increasing demand for its cloud solutions. Manhattan Associates cloud revenue\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nManhattan appears well-positioned for sustained growth with\u00a0a full\u00a0pipeline of potential new projects, over 100 implementations completed in the first quarter, and continued investment in innovation and hiring. This stock is also down around 14% from its March peak, so I see\u00a0big\u00a0upside in the coming quarters as it\u00a0makes a recovery.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven though we may no longer be in a travel boom, don\u2019t count out travel stocks just yet. Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) operates popular travel websites such as Booking.com, Priceline, and Kayak. It had\u00a0a very strong\u00a0start to the year. In the first quarter, revenue grew 17% to reach $4.4 billion compared to last year\u2019s period. Adjusted EBITDA surged even more, with a 53% increase to $900 million. Furthermore, the company beat earnings per share expectations by 43.66%, and revenue beat estimates by 3.74%.\n\nThe stock is up 129% over the past five years, and you also get a 0.9% dividend yield here. Analysts expect around 20% annual EPS growth over the next five years. If this company continues to beat estimates like this, I expect BKNG stock to deliver\u00a0well\u00a0over 20% gains annually.\n\nBooking.com recently saw a\u00a0huge\u00a0jump in the number of \u201cconnected transactions,\u201d\u00a0which are\u00a0when travelers book multiple travel needs like flights and hotels during the same trip. This connected trip option is still new, but is gaining popularity quickly.\n\nWith summer travel looking healthy so far and the connected trip feature helping to boost revenue,\u00a0I believe\u00a0Booking Holdings is well-positioned for a good year in 2024.\u00a0Room bookings over the next few months may slow down\u00a0some\u00a0due to issues in the Middle East and travelers booking closer to their travel dates.\u00a0However, as a leader in the market with improved profitability and share repurchases boosting earnings per share,\u00a0I think\u00a0any dips in the stock price present a buying opportunity for this high-quality growth stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Roundup: Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO) And The Rest Of The Beverages and Alcohol Segment\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season comes to a close, it\u2019s time to take stock of this quarter's best and worst performers in the beverages and alcohol industry, including Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO) and its peers.\n\nThese companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the explosion of alcoholic craft beer drinks or the steady decline of non-alcoholic sugary sodas. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.\n\nThe 12 beverages and alcohol stocks we track reported a decent Q1; on average, revenues were in line with analyst consensus estimates. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 15.8% below consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the beverages and alcohol stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 2.5% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nVita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO)\n\nFounded in 2004 followed by a 2021 IPO, The Vita Coco Company (NASDAQ:COCO) offers coconut water products that are a natural way to quench thirst.\n\nVita Coco reported revenues of $111.7 million, up 1.8% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Celsius Holdings Inc. shares dropped by the most in more than three years after industry sales data signaled that the energy-drink maker\u2019s revenue growth is cooling.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWall Street Moves to Fastest Settlement of Trades in a Century For Private Credit\u2019s Top Talent, $1 Million a Year Is Not Enough Israeli Airstrike and Egyptian Guard\u2019s Death Ratchet Up Tensions Treasury Yields Spike After Pair of Weak US Sales: Markets Wrap Catering to the Ultra-Rich Is a Booming Business in Australia\n\nThe stock tumbled as much as 19% on Tuesday, wiping out roughly $4 billion of the company\u2019s market value. Celsius\u2019 year-over-year sales growth in tracked US channels slowed during the week ended May 18 compared to earlier in the month, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Eric Serotta, citing NielsenIQ data. He also said the company\u2019s market share, excluding its powder products, slipped in recent weeks, and its percentage of sales on promotion increased.\n\nCelsius is more likely to have an outsized share-price reaction to this data than larger multinational firms given a bigger portion of its revenue comes from the US, so the data are seen as a closer read of business trends, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Gerald Pascarelli. As a less mature company, Celsius is also largely valued on top-line trends and market-share gains, instead of earnings, he added.\n\n\u201cSome of the more near-term data didn\u2019t look as good as people were hoping, but I think anytime you have a double-digit move I would classify it as an overreaction,\u201d Pascarelli said referring to Tuesday\u2019s stock decline.\n\nFor the week ended May 18, Celsius\u2019 year-over-year sales growth in tracked US channels slowed to 39%, down from 50% for the week ended May 4, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Serotta wrote in a note.\n\nPascarelli at Wedbush said trends were widely expected to decelerate this month and potentially in June, before an anticipated improvement in July following retailers\u2019 shelf resets.\n\nDespite the plunge, Celsius shares remain up more than 40% this year, still outperforming consumer staples peers.\n\nStephens Inc. analyst Jim Salera said investors are also concerned about additional headwinds related to inventory changes made by Celsius distributor PepsiCo Inc.\n\nAfter hosting meetings with Celsius Chief Executive Officer John Fieldly, Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan warned in a May 27 note that second-quarter sales could again be affected as PepsiCo changes the amount of Celsius inventory it holds. Adjustments weighed on Celsius sales in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cPepsiCo could further reduce Celsius inventories, similar to 1Q24, resulting in 2Q24 sales below end-demand,\u201d Astrachan wrote in a note to clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares in PepsiCo, which holds a stake in Celsius, slid as much as 3.4% on Tuesday. Industry data also recently signaled weaker trends for the snack and soft-drink giant, in contrast to rival Coca-Cola Co.\n\nSalera viewed the slump in Celsius stock as a buying opportunity. He sees the company continuing to gain shelf space at retailers, which will increase the visibility of the brand and support new household growth.\n\n--With assistance from Janet Freund.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNew York\u2019s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade The Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn\u2019t When Business Is Just a Game A Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH) stock dropped 17% as of 12:30 p.m. ET today as the market absorbed new Nielsen data.\n\nFor the week ending May 18th, the energy drink maker saw sales growth decline sequentially to 39%. While this figure is higher than the company's 37% sales growth in the first quarter of 2024, Celsius saw its market share dip from 10.8% to 10.5%.\n\nMaking matters worse, Morgan Stanley analyst Dana Mohsenian warned that Celsius could see slower growth as it laps the growth it saw from the start of its PepsiCo deal.\n\nHowever, this data focuses on one week's worth of sales. Here's why Celsius remains interesting over the longer term.\n\nCan Celsius keep its growth story going?\n\nThough Celsius's days of triple-digit sales growth have probably come to an end, the company still offers investors a promising investment thesis.\n\nLooking through a slightly shorter-term lens for a second, the company expects to see its best retailer shelf space gains in company history this year. With retailers scrambling to capitalize on Celsius's surging popularity, these spring shelf resets could lead to a healthy growth bump starting in July. With PepsiCo's distribution heft backing its operations, Celsius is now able to go toe-to-toe with big dogs like Monster and Red Bull for this valuable product placement.\n\nOver the longer term, the company has big ambitions in international markets. In January 2024, Celsius began selling in Canada with PepsiCo's help. Meanwhile, it recently signed numerous agreements with Japanese beverage giant Suntory to expand to the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\nWith international sales only accounting for 5% of the company's sales, these new markets keep Celsius deserving of its premium valuation. However, with high growth rates like these, volatility will always follow Celsius wherever it goes.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Investors seeking to build sustainable wealth over the long term regard buy-and-hold stocks as one of the most reliable investment strategies. By focusing on fundamentally strong companies and holding their stocks for extended periods, investors can typically enjoy substantial returns. Meanwhile, they can better mitigate the risks associated with short-term market volatility.\n\nThe principle behind buy-and-hold investing is simple. First, identify quality stocks with strong growth prospects, solid financials and competitive advantages. Then, hold onto these investments through market ups and downs. Historically, this approach has been proven to generate impressive returns. Research suggests that the S&P 500 index has delivered an average annual return of approximately 10% over the past 90 years. Such an impressive performance underscores the power of long-term investing.\n\nWarren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, is a staunch advocate of the buy-and-hold strategy. His investment philosophy centers on purchasing stocks of companies with strong fundamentals and holding them indefinitely. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has consistently outperformed the market, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. With that information, let\u2019s delve into three stocks that are well-positioned to deliver long-term growth and stability.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBeverage company Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has emerged as a standout player in the energy drink market. It captures the attention of health-conscious consumers with its unique beverages. Management\u2019s innovative product line has resonated well with a growing demographic focused on fitness and wellness.\n\nIn early May, the energy drink company reported robust first quarter fiscal 2024 results, highlighting its ability to scale its operations and grow market share. Revenue increased 37% year-over-year (YOY) to $356 million. Gross margin surged to a record high of 51%, benefiting from economies of scale in sourcing. First quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 27 cents jumped 108% YOY.\n\nIn fact, CELH\u2019s strong sales momentum is primarily attributed to its success in expanding its global distribution channels. It has a long-term distribution agreement with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)\u00a0for the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the beverage company has recently announced expansions into the U.K., Ireland, France, Australia and New Zealand. Currently, international markets account for just 5%\u00a0of revenues. This suggests robust growth opportunities outside the U.S. Consensus analyst estimates call for 40% earnings growth through the next two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), CELH stock has surged by close to 75%. As a result, the stock currently trades at an expensive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 94x. And, its trailing sales ratio of 15.8x indicates high growth expectations. Investors may want to wait for a pullback toward the $90 level.\n\nDiebold Nixdorf (DBD) A Diebold Nixdorf (DBD) sign featuring the company logo.\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinancial and retail technology company Diebold Nixdorf (NYSE:DBD) is a company known for its ATM managed services. DBD offers a variety of security solutions and self-service technologies. This makes it a potential pick for investors looking for buy-and-hold technology stocks in the financial transformation space.\n\nFirst quarter metrics showed mixed results for Diebold Nixdorf. Revenue grew 5.1% YOY to $897.1 million, falling short of analyst expectations. Nonetheless, the company delivered positive net income of $45.2 million, suggesting a strategic focus on profitability.\n\nRecently, Diebold Nixdorf has unveiled Vynamic\u00ae Connection Points 7 (VCP 7), its latest self-service software, at the Intersect Conference. Investors are hopeful that VCP 7 could streamline digital transformation for financial institutions, potentially increasing efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n\nSince January, DBD stock has advanced 54%, trading favorably at 10.5x earnings and almost 1x sales. At present, the 12-month median price forecast for DBD stock stands at $44.60.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) specializes in high-performance memory and storage solutions that are essential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nIn its Q2 of fiscal year 2024 report, Micron revealed strong momentum across all of its four segments, driven by strong AI server demand. Revenue jumped 58% YOY to $5.82 billion. Adjusted EPS improved to 42 cents, compared to a loss of $1.91 per share in the previous year.\n\nThe ramp-up of investments in data centers, cloud and AI is boosting demand for Micron\u2019s offerings. With high-bandwidth memory (HBM) widely regarded as a bottleneck technology for AI, Micron\u2019s flagship HMB3E chip for AI servers is already sold out for 2025. The chipmaker is ramping up its HBM offering with 30% less power than the competition. Amid\u00a0growing concerns\u00a0about AI\u2019s power consumption, HBM3E is expected to boost Micron\u2019s market share and lead to sustained\u00a0pricing strength due to tight supply.\n\nAlso, the company\u2019s diverse segments and products are demonstrating robust growth momentum, which helps minimize revenue concentration risks for Micron. In Q3, management anticipates YOY revenue growth to accelerate to 76%. Record revenue expectations for fiscal 2025 indicate management\u2019s confidence in its current growth momentum over the next several quarters.\n\nSince January, MU stock has increased by 49%. Shares are changing hands at 7.7 times trailing sales. Wall Street remains optimistic for Micron stock with a potential upside of 10% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "Where Will Monster Growth Stock Celsius Be In 5 Years?",
        "content": "In the last five years, shares of Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) are up 6,290%. That means for every $1,000 someone invested in Celsius five years ago, it is worth over $60,000 today. Not bad. The owner of the Celsius energy drink brand has grown its revenue like gangbusters as it gains market share in the highly profitable energy drink space and makes investors a fortune in the process.\n\nBut what will the next five years look like? The company has some big plans up its sleeve and just reported another strong earnings report, sending the stock close to all-time highs. Let's see where this monster grower could end up in five years and whether the stock is a buy at today's prices.\n\nSlowing revenue growth, expanding margins\n\nOn its face, revenue growth looked a bit weak in the first quarter of 2024. It was just 37% year over year in the period compared to 102% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales hit $355.7 million -- a record -- but investors should be rightfully concerned about slowing sales growth as this business matures.\n\nHowever, it looks like management had a decent explanation for the huge slowdown: inventory buildup among its retailers and distributors. In 2023, Celsius's distributors were building up inventory in anticipation of demand, which led to a pull-forward in revenue growth and those 100%+ numbers.\n\nNow, the opposite is occurring, which is causing revenue growth to slow considerably. From a customer standpoint, retail sales of Celsius were estimated to have grown 72% year over year in the first quarter in the United States, which is closer to the true growth rate of the Celsius brand. It now has an 11.5% category share in its home market.\n\nA maturing business means expanding profit margins. Celsius had a record 23.4% operating margin in the first quarter, which is a great sign for shareholders. It is closing in on competitor Monster Beverage, which had an operating margin of 28.5% in the same period.\n\nCan the brand work internationally?\n\nThere is still room for Celsius to grow in the United States. With how fast it is gaining market share, it wouldn't surprise me if the company doubled or tripled revenue through market share gains and price hikes. This should help consolidated revenue grow for years to come, although you shouldn't expect 100% growth forever.\n\nEventually, the company will need to expand internationally if it hopes to keep growing revenue and match the size of the industry behemoth Monster Beverage. Monster does around $7.3 billion in annual revenue compared to Celsius's $1.4 billion. The brand has announced expansions into France, Australia, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand in recent months.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far, this hasn't shown up on the income statement. International sales were just $16.2 million in the first quarter, or less than 5% of overall sales. Investors can't expect these markets to catch fire overnight, but there should be some concern that Celsius is unable to replicate the success it has had in the United States in other countries. International revenue will be an important number to track over the next few years as it will be the key to keeping up these high levels of revenue growth for the brand. CELH Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWhere will Celsius stock be in 5 years?\n\nCelsius is closing in on $1.5 billion in annual sales. Let's assume it keeps growing market share in the United States, is able to implement price increases to keep up with inflation, and finally sees some modest success in new countries over the next five years. If this happens, I think Celsius could 3x its revenue to $4.5 billion five years from now.\n\nLet's also assume profit margins expand to 25% and apply them to a $4.5 billion revenue base. That is $1.125 billion in annual earnings. Today, Celsius has a market capitalization of $22 billion, or a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 20 based on this five-year earnings projection. Again, these are projected earnings five years into the future, not today's earnings. This P/E is barely lower than the average P/E for the stock market today.\n\nWhat this tells me is that a lot of strong revenue growth is already priced into Celsius stock, even if you expect revenue to triple over the next five years. For this reason, I wouldn't be surprised to see Celsius shares at a similar level five years from now, making the stock a risky bet for investors at the moment.\n\nCelsius is a fast-growing company. But that doesn't automatically mean the stock is a buy.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Worldwide Takeover: 3 Stocks Poised for Global Domination",
        "content": "Consider buying these stocks if you want your portfolio to grow!\n\nThe global stock market is undergoing profound transformations right now, with the rapid globalization of traditional companies, as well as the decentralization of the world\u2019s largest companies, with many rising out of Asia, as opposed to the 20th and 21st centuries, which saw a great increase in companies which arose in the West.\n\nToday, I have focused on three stocks that I think have great potential in both the domestic and international markets and offer great solutions to various global problems. Additionally, all these companies have great growth potential, making them great stocks poised for global dominance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three stocks that I think you should invest in:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a semiconductor manufacturer offering international access to chip fabrication and engineering services, being best known for manufacturing chips for industry giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). TSM is trading at $153+ with a market cap of ~$680 billion.\n\nRevenue estimates are stable, ranging from $19.74 to $20.01 billion for this quarter. Additionally, TSM regularly beats estimates, with EPS surprising investors by 4.50% last quarter. Revenue and earnings held still, with quarterly YoY revenue growth of 16.50%, and quarterly YoY earnings growth at 8.90%.\n\nThe semiconductor sector has a projected CAGR of 12.2% until 2029. However, factors such as market volatility, supply and demand shocks, and geopolitical tensions could cause this growth to stagnate. To mitigate these risks, TSM is diversifying its factories out of East Asia and into more stable countries, which is why this stock is a buy.\n\nCelsius (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) develops, processes, markets, distributes and sells functional energy drinks and liquid supplements in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and internationally.\n\nCELH stock has seen year-over-year (YoY) quarterly revenue growth of 36.80% with an overall revenue of 1.41 billion dollars. Like TSM stock, Celsius regularly beats estimates, and EPS surprised investors by 42.10% last quarter. Celsius Holdings has had a profit margin of 18.63% along with an operating margin of 23.39% which further solidifies its appeal as a stock poised for global domination.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe global energy drink market is still a growth market anticipated to outpace economic expansion by a wide margin. Celsius has to face some fierce competitors \u2013 companies like Red Bull and Monster. But great financials, an innovative product line, and plans to go international make CELH stock a must-buy.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides end-to-end intelligent workflow automation platform solutions for digital businesses in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and internationally. Currently, it is trading at ~$771, with a market cap of ~$158 billion.\n\nNOW stock has quarterly earnings growth of 131.30% and a huge positive operating cash flow of $3.84 billion. This has led analysts to set a price target of $860.88, representing a 12.5% growth potential. This is combined with the fact that both earnings and revenue have seen steady growth over the last few years.\n\nAdditionally, NOW has started to expand hiring by increasing the number of Salesforce employees it hires; with Salesforce being its biggest competitor. Stealing high-quality workers, great financials, and the opportunity to grow in an international market make this top-rated technology growth stock a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.comPublishing Guidelines.\n\nAchintya Pasricha is a self-taught investor who has recently started to publish articles on a freelance basis.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM appears well poised for growth, thanks to its robust business strategies. The company is significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars, which are optimize, drive and growth. The company is actively managing productivity and innovation as well as aligning work to the interconnected trends in food security, health and wellbeing.\r\n\r\nManagement reaffirmed its earlier earnings per share (EPS) guidance for the full year. The company envisions adjusted EPS in the band of $5.25-$6.25 for the full year.\n\nLet\u2019s Delve Deep\n\nUnder the optimize pillar, the company had expanded alternative protein capabilities in Decatur, IL, and starch production in Marshall, MN. The company concluded its alternative protein expansion in Serbia. As part of the company\u2019s optimizing pillar, it has been adapting with consumers changing nutritional preferences. Under its drive pillar, the company is adapting its organizational structure to meet operational excellence and set goals.\r\n\r\nUnder the growth pillar, the company is looking to expand its footprint in fast-growing alternative protein. Notably, Archer Daniels had an agreement with Benson Hill to process and commercialize a portfolio of proprietary ingredients derived from their ultra-high protein soybeans. Also, the company launched Biosolutions to expand its portfolio of sustainable higher-margin solutions, particularly for pharmaceuticals and personal care markets. ADM is also utilizing innovative technologies to develop new products and boost operating capabilities. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn 2024, the global grain and oil seed supply is likely to increase as expected improvements in weather will support huge production across the major South American countries. Management assumes commodity prices to ease, thus anticipating global soybean crush margins to moderate in 2024, moving into a range of $35-$60 per metric ton. From the demand side, the company continues to forecast vegetable oil demand growth from renewable diesel and lower soybean meal demand growth to boost margin improvement.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter, for carbohydrate solutions, management anticipates the quarter to be higher year over year, driven by robust demand and margins in North American starches and sweeteners, somewhat offset by moderating margins in wheat milling and international corn milling after elevated results in the year-ago period. Further, it projects a strong demand for ethanol both domestically and in the export markets.\n\nHere\u2019s More\n\nIn the recent developments, the company had entered into an accelerated share repurchase (\u201cASR\u201d) agreement with delayed share delivery with Merrill Lynch International, an affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc., to buy back $1 billion of the company\u2019s common stock. The company returned $1.3 billion to its shareholders via repurchases during the quarter, with $1 billion executed via ASR program. Management intends to actualize $1 billion of additional share repurchases for the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, Archer Daniels provided $0.7 billion in cash for operating activities. It repurchased shares worth $1.3 billion and cash dividends of $257 million in the first quarter. As of Mar 31, 2024, there were 501,763,545 shares outstanding. The company announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents, payable Jun 5, to shareholders of record as of May 16. Notably, this marks the 370th straight quarterly payment.\r\n\r\nWe note that shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 12.9% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s 3.2% rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely Utz Brands UTZ, Celsius Holdings CELH and Diageo DEO.\r\n\r\nUtz Brands manufactures a diverse portfolio of salty snacks.

        "content": "The mega-cap tech stocks have garnered much attention in recent months. However, certain smaller companies have also performed well, with some small-cap stocks to buy showing promise for growth. In fact, several small-cap stocks have outperformed the large-caps that typically steal headlines. Some have even logged triple-digit price increases this year and are still good candidates for small-cap stocks to buy.\r\n\r\nWhile larger cap stocks have performed well amid a narrowing market, analysts suggest some small-cap stocks to buy may see increased growth as the market broadens. Generally, small-cap stocks tend to be more adaptable to changing economic conditions. As such, individual small-cap stocks offer higher growth potential and often outpace the S&P 500 over the long term. However, this implies these small-cap stocks to buy typically come with higher risk due to greater volatility.\r\n\r\nThe following small-cap stocks to buy have been crushing it on the Russell 2000 and have the potential to keep momentum going while beating the Magnificent Seven:\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX) Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Romix Image\n\nOne of the small-cap stocks to buy is Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX). It is well-positioned to break into the lucrative weight loss \u201cmiracle\u201d drugs market with its first-in-class candidate VK2735. It recently completed positive Phase 1 clinical trials on its candidate, sending the stock price soaring 270% higher. Since then, the stock has stabilized a tad lower and trades nearly double the pre-news level. As Ozempic has become synonymous with several new drugs that help reduce weight and provide substantial revenue in that area, the company may benefit from its entry into that arena.\r\n\r\nDespite recent gains, analysts still consider the stock undervalued and expect an average target price of $113.8, representing a 57% upside. The company recently completed a stock offering to raise $630 million in cash. This compares favorably to the reported net loss of only $27.4 million last quarter. Viking has substantial capital and should be able to advance its drug candidate towards approval without having to dilute its shares.\n\n\u200bCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe second pick in this list of small-cap stocks to buy is energy drink and liquid supplement company Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). The firm has seen its share price increase 75% since its recent low in February after reporting 37% annual sales growth. In addition, it even reported a more substantial beat, with a profit gain of 89%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStory continues\n\nAs it looks to break into new markets to gain market share aggressively, it can continue boosting sales. It has sizable cash reserves of $880 million to support this effort, accumulated by not paying dividends and retaining all income. This positions Celsius firmly in the growth stock category, making it a matching candidate as one of the small-cap stocks to buy.\r\n\r\nInvestors still see a substantial upside for the company even after recent gains, as it has beaten EPS estimates for several quarters now. The consensus average price target is $93.31 per share, and virtually all analysts rate it a buy.\n\nHippo Holdings (HIPO) miniature home next to pen, pad of paper, calculator and coins on a desk\n\nSource: MIND AND I / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final pick in this list of small-cap stocks to buy is Hippo Holdings (NYSE:HIPO). The company provides online insurance and loan technology for homes and mortgages. When the Fed cuts interest rates, the housing industry is expected to see an increase in sales, implying a greater need for Hippo\u2019s services.\n\nThe home insurance innovator\u2019s share price has more than doubled since the start of the year, as investors believe it will benefit from secular trends in the lending industry. The company saw its most recent gains after reporting solid first-quarter earnings, with revenue more than doubling and losses decreasing 49%.\r\n\r\nAnalysts who underestimated the company\u2019s growth in the previous period see a potential upside of 13%, with a price target of $24.70 per share. Almost all analysts rate the company as a buy, seeing sales growth of 87.50% year-over-year (YOY) in June and growth estimates of 57.70% next year compared to S&P500\u2019s 13%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Celsius (CELH) Reliance on International Sales: What Investors Need to Know",
        "content": "Have you evaluated the performance of Celsius Holdings Inc.'s (CELH) international operations during the quarter that concluded in March 2024? Considering the extensive worldwide presence of this company, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial resilience and potential for growth.\n\nIn the current era of a tightly interconnected global economy, the proficiency of a company to penetrate international markets significantly influences its financial health and trajectory of growth. For investors, the key is to grasp how reliant a company is on overseas markets, as this provides insights into the durability of its earnings, its ability to exploit different economic cycles, and its overall growth capabilities.\n\nBeing present in foreign markets serves as protection against local economic declines and helps benefit from more rapidly expanding economies. Yet, such expansion also introduces challenges related to currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varied market behaviors.\n\nUpon examining CELH's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $355.71 million, marking an increase of 36.8% from the year-ago quarter. We will next turn our attention to dissecting CELH's international revenue to get a clearer picture of how significant its operations are outside its main base.\n\nDecoding CELH's International Revenue Trends\n\nDuring the quarter, Europe contributed $14.14 million in revenue, making up 4.0% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $11.9 million, this meant a surprise of +18.84%. Looking back, Europe contributed $12.12 million, or 3.5%, in the previous quarter, and $8.65 million, or 3.3%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nOther International generated $1.38 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 0.4% of the total. This represented a surprise of -32.07% compared to the $2.03 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Other International accounted for $1.87 million (0.5%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $1.48 million (0.6%) to the total revenue.\n\nAsia accounted for 0.2% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $0.68 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -57.94%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $1.61 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Asia contributed $0.64 million (0.2%) and $1.26 million (0.5%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue Projections for Overseas Markets\n\nThe current fiscal quarter's total revenue for Celsius, as projected by Wall Street analysts, is expected to reach $431.69 million, reflecting an increase of 32.5% from the same quarter last year. The breakdown of this revenue by foreign region is as follows: Europe is anticipated to contribute 5% or $21.74 million, Other International 0.5% or $2.14 million and Asia 0.5% or $2.05 million.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to report a total annual revenue of $1.74 billion for the full year, marking an increase of 31.7% compared to last year. The expected revenue contributions from Europe, Other International and Asia are projected to be 4.8% ($83.07 million), 0.5% ($8.52 million) and 0.4% ($6.06 million) of the total revenue, in that order.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCelsius' reliance on international markets for revenues offers both opportunities and risks. Hence, keeping an eye on its international revenue trends could significantly help forecast the company's prospects.\n\nIn an era of growing international ties and escalating geopolitical disputes, financial analysts on Wall Street pay keen attention to these developments to fine-tune their earnings estimations for businesses operating across borders. It's important to note, however, that a range of additional variables, like a company's local market status, also play a crucial role in shaping these forecasts.\n\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\n\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool, comes with an externally validated impressive track record. It effectively utilizes shifts in earnings projections to act as a dependable barometer for forecasting short-term stock price trends.\n\nCelsius, bearing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to mirror the broader market's movements in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nCelsius' Recent Stock Market Performance\n\nOver the past month, the stock has seen an increase of 3.9% in its value, whereas the Zacks S&P 500 composite has posted an increase of 1.3%. The Zacks Consumer Staples sector, Celsius' industry group, has ascended 5% over the identical span. In the past three months, there's been an increase of 28.6% in the company's stock price, against a rise of 4.3% in the S&P 500 index. The broader sector has increased by 4.7% during this interval.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "INGR or CELH: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "Investors interested in stocks from the Food - Miscellaneous sector have probably already heard of Ingredion (INGR) and Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nIngredion and Celsius Holdings Inc. are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that INGR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nINGR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.43, while CELH has a forward P/E of 75. We also note that INGR has a PEG ratio of 1.13. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 2.33.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for INGR is its P/B ratio of 2.11. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CELH has a P/B of 56.56.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, INGR holds a Value grade of A, while CELH has a Value grade of D.\n\nINGR is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that INGR is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +3.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, which Celsius falls in, has gained 2.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nCelsius is expected to post earnings of $0.26 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +52.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.10 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +42.9%. This estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.49 indicates a change of +34.7% from what Celsius is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Celsius.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CELH _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Celsius, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $431.69 million indicates a year-over-year change of +32.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.74 billion and $2.19 billion estimates indicate +31.7% and +26.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCelsius reported revenues of $355.71 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.8%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.13 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $388.87 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -8.53%. The EPS surprise was +35%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCelsius is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Celsius. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Incredible Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying on the Dip",
        "content": "Some stocks can swing wildly in the near term, and this is why many long-term investors like to buy stocks on the dip. Investors know it's the performance of the business over many years that builds wealth, so buying the stock at a discount from its previous highs can offer a more attractive value to improve returns.\n\nWith that in mind, let's see why the following Motley Fool contributors believe now is the right time to buy Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU), Lululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU), and Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH).\n\nDon't give up on this streaming winner\n\nJennifer Saibil (Roku): Roku keeps pumping out higher sales and improving profits, and its stock keeps falling. It's down 35% this year and 87% from highs in 2021.\n\nLet's talk a bit about what's going on. Roku, as many readers know, makes streaming devices. It's the leading streaming company in the U.S. by hours streamed, and it's also the top-selling streaming device brand in the U.S. However, its main source of sales is its advertising partnerships. It's gone through some ups and downs over the past few years, soaring with the onset of the pandemic and then pulling back in the aftermath. Sales growth has been brisk, but it's very stuck in the land of the unprofitable.\n\nInvestors have become really down on Roku this year, though, despite its growth, and it looks like it's a bit much. Total revenue increased 19% over last year. Streaming households, its new term for accounts, increased 14% year over year, while total streaming hours were up 23%. Average revenue per user was flat year over year, which is better than some of the declines the company has reported.\n\nProfitability, or lack thereof, is improving. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased from a $69 million loss last year to positive $41 million this year in the first quarter, and net loss improved from $194 million to $51 million. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was positive and increasing for the third consecutive quarter at $427 million.\n\nWhat started the landslide was Walmart's announcement in February that it was acquiring Roku competitor Vizio. Even though Vizio doesn't look like a threat to Roku, having Walmart's backing scared investors. That news came on the heels of a tepid fourth-quarter earnings report, and Roku stock has continued to slide.\n\nThe good news for investors is that this is a great opportunity to buy shares of a top company on the dip. Roku stock trades at 2.3 times trailing-12-month earnings, a cheap valuation for a stock with its potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuy the sale on Lululemon\n\nJohn Ballard (Lululemon Athletica): Lululemon has been an incredible growth story over the last few decades. The company's annual revenue grew at an annualized rate of 20% over the last 10 years, with annualized growth accelerating to 24% over the last two years. The stock followed suit, delivering a cumulative return of almost 700%. For anyone who has followed the athletic apparel industry, Lululemon's growth is no surprise, as the trend toward athleisure has been driving very consistent sales growth across the industry for years.\n\nThe stock recently fell after the company's quarterly update in March. Lululemon reported lower-than-expected revenue growth for the fiscal fourth quarter, and guidance didn't leave investors feeling any better. Management expects full-year top-line growth to land between 11% and 12% year over year. That is not the level of growth investors have come to expect from Lululemon.\n\nHere are two important reasons to buy the dip:\n\nLululemon's lower growth reflects an industrywide slowdown. In fact, Lululemon's guidance for double-digit revenue growth is head and shoulders above the world's leading brands that are forecasting single-digit sales increases this year. Nike's fiscal 2024 revenue is pacing to be up just 1% year over year. Lululemon stock is now trading at its most attractive valuation in years. Shares currently trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28. The stock briefly traded at this level most recently in March 2020, and before then in 2017.\n\nOverall, nothing has changed the long-term growth trajectory for the industry. The long-term trends driving demand for athletic wear, including active lifestyles and athleisure, will continue to fuel growth for Lululemon as it has over the last 20 years.\n\nThis doesn't mean the stock can't hit new lows in the near term, but I believe investors who buy today and hold over the next decade will do well with their investment.\n\nThis growth story is far from over\n\nJeremy Bowman (Celsius Holdings): Celsius Holdings, the energy drink maker, is one of the best-performing stocks on the market over the last four years, up about 5,000%. The brand has grown from a niche player in the beverage industry, popular in gyms and health clubs, to a mainstream beverage brand, sold everywhere from Costco to convenience stores. And it posted triple-digit revenue growth in many of its quarters along the way.\n\nHowever, more recently, Celsius stock has pulled back from its peak in March, down by about 25% since then. There hasn't been any major catalyst for that pullback. It seems more a combination of concerns about its valuation and changes in the macro outlook as persistent inflation has led investors to suspect that the Fed won't lower interest rates this year.\n\nFor long-term investors, Celsius' drawdown seems to offer a solid entry point. The company just reported first-quarter results so we have a clear picture of the business. Shares pulled back modestly as Celsius missed revenue estimates with reported revenue growing 37%, but that was primarily due to an inventory adjustment by PepsiCo, the distribution partner responsible for purchasing 62% of its product.\n\nUnderlying growth remained strong. According to data from Circana, an industry research firm, Celsius' sales in the key U.S. chain-store channel jumped 72%, showing that the brand remains red-hot. Even better, Celsius's margin surged during the quarter as it also controlled its inventory and benefited from lower input and material costs. Earnings per share more than doubled from $0.13 to $0.27 as a result.\n\nCelsius still has a lot of whitespace for growth, including international markets, which only make up a small fraction of sales today, and in new channels like restaurants and food service, where it's just starting to gain exposure thanks to placement from Pepsi.\n\nAs Celsius gains share and expands the energy drink category, it's easy to imagine the beverage stock growing to approach the size of Monster Beverage, whose market cap is more than triple that of Celsius currently. Investors can get a good entry point by taking advantage of the recent sell-off and buying the stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roku, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Roku wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "You don\u2019t need a lot of money to invest in the stock market. It\u2019s possible to buy fractional shares with as little as $1. However, investors who can put more money into the stock market have the potential to realize higher gains.\n\nPortfolios compound over time, especially if you pick the right investments. An annualized 8% growth rate can have a significant impact on your finances when you stretch your time horizon to multiple decades. While index funds can offer solid returns, investors may also want to consider these hot stocks if they have $1,000 ready to invest. These are the best stocks to buy right now.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers a healthy sports drink that doesn\u2019t have any sugar, high fructose corn syrup or similar unhealthy ingredients. Instead of using those ingredients, the beverage offers plenty of caffeine.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe formula has worked well for the corporation. Revenue surged by 95% year-over-year in Q4 2023, while net income came in at $39.1 million. The company reported $28.2 million in net losses in the same period last year.\n\nCelsius Holdings generates most of its sales in North America. International markets represent relatively untapped opportunities, and the company is making strides in those segments. International sales should grow at a high rate for multiple years and support a higher stock price.\n\nThe average price target suggests a 14% upside from current levels. Celsius Holdings is rated as a Strong Buy among 11 analysts. The stock has gained 52% year-to-date and is in the middle of a correction. Shares are up by more than 5,000% over the past five years.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) offers a reasonable valuation and strong financials. The stock trades at a 19 P/E ratio and offers a 1.2% yield. Shares are up by 28% year-to-date and have gained 105% over the past five years.\n\nThe fintech firm exceeded previous guidance in the first quarter of 2024. Revenue growth came in at 11% year-over-year (YoY), which wasn\u2019t a big shock, but 34% YoY net income growth is significant. American Express suggested it will achieve revenue growth ranging from 9% to 11% per year beyond 2026. The firm also established a mid-teens growth rate for EPS. The 39% YoY diluted EPS growth rate exceeded the target.\n\nConsumers will continue to use credit and debit cards in any economy. American Express makes a small percentage of each transaction. However, it isn\u2019t only older generations that use AMEX cards. The firm reported that 60% of the people who became cardholders in the first quarter were Millennials or Gen Z consumers. A younger core audience will help American Express deliver more growth in the years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has established itself as a fast food leader. The company offers healthier alternatives than most of its competitors, and customers keep coming back for more. Price hikes and higher costs aren\u2019t stopping people from visiting Chipotle stores.\n\nThe fast food restaurant chain reported 14.1% YoY revenue growth in Q1 2024. The company opened 47 new restaurants in the quarter and included a Chipotlane in 43 locations. The bottom line grew at an even faster rate. Diluted earnings per share increased by 23.9% YoY. Leadership has a long-term target of more than doubling its business in North America and expanding internationally.\n\nChipotle is still on pace to open 285 to 315 new restaurants in 2024. The stock\u2019s 42% year-to-date performance suggests it is also on pace to outperform the stock market. Looking from a wider lens, investors will notice the stock has more than quadrupled over the past five years. Rising profit margins can enable more growth for long-term investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in CELH.

        "title": "Top Russell 2000 Picks: 3 Small-Cap Stocks to Scoop Up This May",
        "content": "The stock market continues to question whether a large cap dominance \u2014 especially that from The Magnificent Seven \u2014 is indeed the best way to invest. While investing in large cap firms is undoubtedly a good strategy, there are plenty of top Russell 2000 stocks to buy. Enter the Russell 2000, 2000 small cap equities in the U.S. market.\n\nSmaller companies have a greater potential to grow rapidly than do their larger counterparts. It\u2019s easier to double revenue early on and becomes increasingly harder as time passes. Beyond that, many investors fear over concentration by investors among the largest equities. It follows then that such investors would logically consider all of the other firms that contribute to the economic engine of the United States. Lets evaluate the top Russell 2000 stocks to buy for ambitious investors.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) sells wet cleaning equipment used in the manufacturing of integrated circuit semiconductors. The stock represents an excellent small-cap opportunity in the chip packaging sector that should not be overlooked.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors will better recognize the opportunity when they understand the company\u2019s most recent preliminary results. ACM Research anticipates that revenues will fall between $150 million and $152 million in the first quarter of 2024. That will represent growth between 102% and 105%.\n\nACM Research is the fastest growing small cap chip stocks available. The company has seen its share price more than double over the past 12 months. Investors should also recognize that the chip packaging sector is expected to grow by double digits on a compounding annual basis between 2024 and 2029. Thus, ACMR represents a firm that has already hit its stride in a sector that should continue to grow. It is certainly one of the better small cap semiconductor plays available to investors at the moment.\n\nBellRing Brands (BRBR) A picture of the Clean Whey Protein Bar flavoured vanilla coconut crunch.\n\nSource: JJava Designs / Shutterstock.com\n\nBellRing Brands (NYSE:BRBR) is a fast growing beverage stock deserving of more attention. The company sells ready-to-drink protein shakes under the Premier brand along with protein powders under its Dymatize brand.\n\nDuring the first quarter sales grew by 18.7%, reaching $430.4 million. One of the more encouraging aspects about the company is that its growth was almost exclusively driven by volume gains and not inflation.\n\nThe company also increased guidance upon releasing that earnings report. I find BellRing Brands particularly interesting because I\u2019m continuously intrigued by fast-growing brands that hit on lifestyle trends. The protein market is expected to grow at a rate between 8% and 9% annually between 2023 and 2032. As consumers continue to avoid carbohydrates in preference of protein, companies like BellRing Brands have a real opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have seen similar stocks including Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) explode of late. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if BellRing Brands can grow similarly.\n\nMind Medicine (MNMD) Dried psilocybe cubensis psilocybin magic mushrooms inside and around a plastic prescription medicine bottle with no lid isolated on white background, Mind Medicine is in the psychedelic medicine business. MNMD stock\n\nSource: Daniel Patrick Martin / Shutterstock.com\n\nMind Medicine (NASDAQ:MNMD) is a psychedelic stock that continues to impress and inspire optimism among investors. Share prices have risen from $4 to $10 in 2024, and are expected to triple from current levels, which will no doubt attract some investors.\n\nThe company is poised for success in relation to the treatment of anxiety with LSD based therapeutics. The FDA granted breakthrough designation to Mind Medicine\u2019s MM120 program for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). In trials, a single dose resulted in a substantial clinically relevant decrease in anxiety with a duration of 12 weeks.\n\nThe company intends to bring its LSD based treatment program to Phase 3 trials this year. It is clear that the pharmaceutical industry is growing rapidly accepting of alternative therapies that would have been considered outlandish years ago. Many companies are now leveraging the therapeutic benefits of drugs such as ketamine and LSD in the treatment of mental health disorders. It is truly the dawning of a new age in that regard, and Mind Medicine may very well emerge as one of the strongest stocks therefrom.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing in Russell 2000 stocks is a smart idea because it focuses on small-cap stocks with substantial growth potential. While individual stocks within the index vary, some are poised to offer significant gains. Additionally, with some expectations of easing inflation and interest rates, now may be an opportune time to find the best Russell 2000 stocks to buy for potential returns. The index provides an extensive view of smaller companies, offering investors exposure to a broader segment of the market beyond large-cap stocks, which can add to portfolio diversification and bring growth prospects.\n\nThese three companies are the three best stocks in the Russell 2000 to buy . If you want to invest in small-cap stocks, it makes more sense to choose the companies that will deliver better profits and growth rather than the entire index, which will provide slower returns. These are the three best Russell 2000 stocks to buy that can bring you those high returns.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) develops and sells energy drinks and liquid supplements. It distributes its products through supermarkets, convenience stores, health clubs and gyms. Analysts are optimistic about the stock\u2019s future performance and offer a median price target of $95.00, its current price is $82.07.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius\u2019s business has recently been underscored by remarkable growth, and Q1 2024 was no exception. The company reported revenue of $355.7 million, up 37% YoY. And net income of $77.8 million was up 89% YoY. In addition to being a growth success story, Celsius also has a strong balance sheet. It holds almost $880 million in cash and cash equivalents and has a debt-to-equity ratio of only 0.17.\n\nMoreover, Celsius now holds an 11.5% market share in MULOC, up from 7.5% a year ago. Management noted in its most recent earnings report that Celsius has gained a significant amount of shelf space and market reach, a result of its strategic partnerships including Celsius\u2019s alliance with PepsiCo.\n\nAdditionally, international expansion is a massive opportunity for Celsius. In Q1 2024, North American sales still accounted for 95% of Celsius\u2019s revenue, but the company\u2019s focus on global expansion could change this. Recently, Celsius announced its plans to expand its distribution to the UK, Ireland, Australia, France and New Zealand. Investors should watch its efforts to tap into these new markets.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) develops and manufactures artificial intelligence servers and storage solutions. After exploding by nearly 500% in the past year, its stock currently trades for just under $800. And analysts are still bullish. 20 analysts have a median price target of $1000.\n\nIn 2024, Super Micro Computer-delivered outstanding growth and attracted much attention. In Q3 2024, the company achieved net sales of $3.85 billion and net income of $402 million, YoY growth of 301% and 467% respectively. After delivering another record quarter, SMCI\u2019s growth is well above its industry peers. In its earnings call, management attributed Super Micro Computer\u2019s top-tier performance to explosive demand for its AI servers. And management also highlighted the company\u2019s expanding market share in AI Infrastructure.\n\nThe AI Server market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of over 18% until 2032. Given Super Micro Computer\u2019s position as a market leader, the company is poised to take advantage of this demand for specialized AI services. In its latest earnings call, Super Micro Computers underlined its commitment to remaining a top player in AI servers. They remarked on the extent to which it is upgrading its production capacity. The company is not only retrofitting its Silicon Valley facilities but is also scaling up its Taiwan and Malaysia factories, which includes acquiring new parts and additional warehouses.\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX) Scientists in a lab\n\nSource: Matej Kastelic / Shutterstock\n\nViking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX) is a biopharmaceutical company that develops drugs for metabolic and endocrine disorders. It is up an astonishing 253% YoY and has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating from 11 Wall Street analysts.\n\nVKTX has already begun capitalizing on the market\u2019s growth, as shown in its Q1 2024 earnings report. The company logged $963 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the end of the quarter, compared to $362 million a year ago. VKTX also beat analyst forecasts for EPS by 7.14% and saw working capital jump 597.63% YoY.\n\nThe most significant catalyst behind VKTX\u2019s growth is its promising weight loss drug, VK2735, which saw promising results from its phase 1 clinical trials. Initial data from the study indicates that the oral tablet caused a 3.3% weight loss after 28 days. Phase 2 clinical trials are slated to start later this year. If the drug receives continued success, investors can expect VKTX to capture a significant portion of the massive $90 billion weight loss market.

        "title": "The 3 Best Energy Drink Stocks to Own to Fuel Your Finances",
        "content": "The best energy drink stocks to own are positioned to benefit from changing consumer trends and booming demand for caffeinated beverages. While coffee remains a popular caffeinated drink, energy drinks are growing at a much faster clip. The global coffee market is only expected to expand by 0.9% annually through 2025. But the energy drink market is forecast to grow by 1.4% annually over the same period. This presents a big opportunity for investors.\n\nRed Bull is not included among the energy drink stocks listed in this article because it is a private company. We instead focus on three appealing publicly traded stocks with exposure to the high-growth energy drink category.\n\nRising health consciousness among Millennials and Gen Z has fueled demand for fortified energy drinks. These are often packed with vitamins, herbs and functional ingredients like caffeine. The mega caffeine boost provided by energy drinks also appeals greatly to this demographic. Major distribution gains for brands like Monster, Rockstar and Celsius have put energy drinks in more stores, making buying convenient. With several catalysts driving continued expansion ahead, energy drink stocks stand out as an attractive investment theme. The companies covered below boast impressive growth trajectories. This makes them some of the best energy drink stocks to own to capitalize on the surging consumption.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith over 37% of the global dedicated energy drink market share, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) continues to strengthen its position as an industry leader. Net sales grew 11.8% year-over-year in Q1 2024 to reach a record $1.90 billion. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, net sales were actually up 15.6% (12.6% without Argentina impact). Gross profit as a percentage of net sales also rose significantly to 54.1% in Q1 2024. In Q1 2023, it hit 52.8%.\n\nMonster Beverage\u2019s consistent double-digit growth has fueled its stock price appreciation over decades. In fact, Monster\u2019s stock performance over the past 30 years makes it the single best-performing stock out of the entire S&P 500 during that stretch \u2013 yes, even better than Apple or Amazon over the same timeframe.\n\nWith strong continued revenue growth projected at 10% annually over the next five years along with strategic international expansion and acquisition initiatives underway, Monster Beverage remains well-positioned for future success. MNST stands out as one of the best energy drink stocks to own for investors who want long-term gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is one of the best energy drink stocks to own thanks to its rapid growth and immense potential. CELH offers healthy, sugar-free energy drinks made with quality ingredients and no artificial flavors. Celsius\u2019s annual sales exploded from $75.1 million in 2019 to over $1.3 billion in 2023.\n\nThe key driver behind Celsius\u2019s incredible revenue growth is expanding distribution. Their international distribution currently only accounts for a small percentage of sales but has been expanding. In 2023, Celsius signed an agreement with PepsiCo for distribution in Canada. It also entered a deal with Suntory Beverage & Food to distribute in the UK and Ireland. These deals pave the way for accelerated international expansion. Domestically, Celsius sells its drinks in over 174,000 retail locations across major chains like Walmart and 7-Eleven.\n\nWall Street continues to be bullish on Celsius, projecting revenue to double to $2.49 billion by 2025. The company just secured a high-profile global sponsorship deal with Scuderia Ferrari Formula One racing team as well. With sales surging, new distribution channels opening internationally, and increased brand visibility, Celsius Holdings is one of the best energy drink stocks to own.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue sky\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is certainly one of the best energy drink stocks to own right now. With over $91 billion in net revenue in 2023 and 14% growth in core constant currency earnings per share, PepsiCo shows that it is a strong and growing company.\n\nA key driver of PepsiCo\u2019s growth in the energy drink space is its 2020 $3.85 billion acquisition of Rockstar Energy. In addition, PepsiCo continues to invest significantly in other energy drink brands like Celsius. These moves have expanded PepsiCo\u2019s presence in the fast-growing energy drink industry.\n\nThe energy drink moves also leverage PepsiCo\u2019s overall size, stability and staying power as a blue chip stock. So PEP offers a less risky way to bet on the energy drink boom compared to investing directly in smaller, less diversified energy drink pure plays.\n\nIn 2023, PepsiCo held or gained market share in over half of its key global beverage and convenience food markets. So its core business remains extremely strong. When one combines steady core growth with big energy drink investments, it\u2019s clear PepsiCo has what it takes to energize portfolios for years to come.\n\nFor investors looking to add an energy drink stock with size, stability and serious growth potential to their portfolio, PEP perfectly fits the bill. Its recent results and smart energy drink investments cement its status as one of the best energy drink stocks to own now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrea van Schalkwyk did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Celsius Holdings, Inc. Just Beat Earnings Expectations: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
        "content": "Investors in Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) had a good week, as its shares rose 6.6% to close at US$77.13 following the release of its quarterly results. Revenues of US$356m fell slightly short of expectations, but earnings were a definite bright spot, with statutory per-share profits of US$0.27 an impressive 39% ahead of estimates. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Celsius Holdings after the latest results.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Celsius Holdings  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFollowing the latest results, Celsius Holdings' 16 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$1.73b in 2024. This would be a huge 22% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to ascend 19% to US$1.10. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$1.88b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.10 in 2024. The consensus seems maybe a little more pessimistic, trimming their revenue forecasts after the latest results even though there was no change to its EPS estimates.\n\nThe consensus has reconfirmed its price target of US$90.38, showing that the analysts don't expect weaker revenue expectations next year to have a material impact on Celsius Holdings' market value. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Celsius Holdings analyst has a price target of US$110 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$35.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that Celsius Holdings' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 30% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 59% p.a. growth over the last five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 5.0% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while Celsius Holdings' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. They also downgraded Celsius Holdings' revenue estimates, but industry data suggests that it is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. Still, earnings are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Celsius Holdings going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nPlus, you should also learn about the  1 warning sign  we've spotted with Celsius Holdings .\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Buying promising stocks before everyone else notices can set you up for a big payday. Some hidden gems can deliver outsized returns, but great opportunities are also hidden in plain sight.\n\nInvestors can find many large market-cap stocks trading at significant discounts. Those deals shouldn\u2019t last forever, and accumulating shares while prices are low can lead to more gains.\n\nFinding long-term stocks can make investing simpler. You won\u2019t have to monitor daily price fluctuations or study much technical analysis. These are some of the best stocks to buy before they pop.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has outperformed the stock market for several years. The cybersecurity firm has almost quintupled over the past five years and has gained 24% year-to-date.\n\nMore businesses are turning to CrowdStrike to protect themselves from cyberattacks. The financial costs and reputation damage from cyberattacks are too great for most companies to risk. CrowdStrike provides a solution that has turned into $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue.\n\nThe company closed out the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 on a high note with 33% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth and $53.7 million in GAAP net income. Profits made a big turnaround as the company reported a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in Q4 FY23.\n\nCrowdStrike continues to grow as other cybersecurity companies report much slower revenue growth than just a year ago. The stock has approval from many analysts with its Strong Buy rating. The average price target implies a 27% upside.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has been winning more attention. The credit and debit card issuer has been a household name for decades,\u00a0but\u00a0strong financial\u00a0results and a low valuation are raising demand for the stock.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the valuation. While most credit card companies have P/E ratios above 30, American Express only has a 19 P/E ratio. American Express would have to gain more than 50% from current levels just to be valued at the same level as its peers. That offers a good margin of safety.\n\nFinancials are another area of strength. American Express grew its revenue by 11% YoY in Q1 2024. Net income soared by an astonishing 34% YoY. The fintech firm attracted many younger consumers. More than 60% of its new cardholders from the quarter were Millennials and Gen Z consumers. To top it all off, investors receive a 1.19% yield just for holding onto their shares. American Express does a good job hiking its dividend, raising its payouts by 17% this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) makes it easier for people to learn new languages. The educational app trades at a $11 billion market cap and a lofty 700 P/E ratio. The valuation will scare away many value investors, but the stock is delivering impressive financial growth that can reward patient investors. As profit margins continue to improve, the valuation should become more reasonable.\n\nDuolingo is reporting high growth numbers in the areas that matter: revenue, profits and user growth. Revenue increased by 45% YoY in Q4 2023, while net income reached $12.1 million. Meanwhile, the company posted a $13.9 million net loss in Q4 2022. The switch to profitability has significantly strengthened the bullish thesis.\n\nDaily active users grew by 65% YoY to reach 26.9 million people. The educational app also had 88.4 million monthly active users, 46% higher than in the same period last year. Those growth rates should help the company rally. If net income continues to expand, the valuation will look more enticing for people who accumulate shares at current levels.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe mega-cap tech giant is an undervalued opportunity hidden in plain sight. You may have used Google to find this article and saw some ads along the way. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the leader in online advertising, and its profit margins are getting more attractive.\n\nRevenue increased by 15% YoY in Q1 2024, while net income soared by 57% YoY. Cost cutting has been working wonders for the company\u2019s profits, just as it did for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Alphabet is getting lean and more efficient while delivering top-line growth.\n\nAlphabet only trades at a 26.3 P/E ratio despite its lead in the advertising industry. Gemini offers enticing opportunities in artificial intelligence that aren\u2019t fully reflected in the company\u2019s stock price. Furthermore, Google Cloud is gaining more market share in the cloud computing industry. Cloud revenue growth outpaced advertising revenue growth, now making up more than 10% of the company\u2019s business model. The stock looks reasonable at current levels.\n\nD.R. Horton (DHI) In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nD.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) is a home construction company with a $50 billion market cap and a 10 P/E ratio. It also trades at a reasonable 0.60 PEG ratio. The stock has outperformed the market with a 252% gain over the past five years.\n\nShares have only inched up by 1% year-to-date, but the company has been posting good financial results. Revenue increased by 14% YoY in Q2 FY24, while net income surged 24% YoY.\n\nD.R. Horton offered fiscal 2024 revenue guidance that ranges from $36.7 billion to $37.7 billion. That represents mid-single-digit YoY growth from fiscal 2023 results. The firm also has an excellent reputation with its dividend. D.R. Horton hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share in 2023, a 20% YoY increase. The company also delivered an annualized dividend growth rate of 22.05% over the past decade.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) Image of the foundation and frame of a house\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) is a smaller construction company receiving a lot of love from investors in the know. The $3.8 billion corporation has a 26.2 P/E ratio and has gained 40% year-to-date. It\u2019s also up by almost 1,000% over the past five years.\n\nThe construction company reported another strong quarter. Revenue increased by 9% YoY in Q1 2024, while net income jumped by 58% YoY. Rapidly expanding profit margins will further reduce the P/E ratio and make it a compelling pick for long-term investors.\n\nThe company\u2019s E-Infrastructure Solutions continue to attract plenty of clients. Sterling expects high single to low double-digit revenue growth in this segment for 2024. The infrastructure firm also anticipates a strong 2024 due to its backlog.\n\nSterling also raised its 2024 guidance. The company came into the year with net income guidance of $155 million to $165 million. The new guidance now suggests Sterling Infrastructure can generate $160 million to $170 million in net income.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a high-growth sports beverage company expanding internationally. While revenue growth took a back seat in the first quarter, profit margins expanded considerably.\n\nCelsius reported 37% YoY revenue growth in Q1 2024. Most of the company\u2019s revenue came from domestic sales, but international sales exhibited 43% YoY growth. The company has plenty of opportunities to reaccelerate revenue growth as it taps into global markets.\n\nThe 89% YoY jump in net income still makes the stock attractive despite the growth deceleration. Celsius Holdings generated $77.8 million in GAAP net income. The stock is still up 42% year-to-date and has gained almost 5,000% over the past five years. Investors shouldn\u2019t expect the 5-year gains to repeat, but Celsius Holdings still has the makings of a stock that can outperform the market in the long run. The pullback after earnings has created a long-term buying opportunity.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in GOOG and CELH.

        "content": "Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 7, 2024\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.273, expectations were $0.2. CELH isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good day. My name is [Elli] (ph), and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Celsius Holdings, Incorporated First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand over the conference call to Paul Wiseman. You may begin.\n\nPaul Wiseman: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are John Fieldly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jarrod Langhans, Chief Financial Officer; and Toby David - Chief of Staff. The call will open to questions following the prepared remarks. The company released its first earnings press release earlier this morning, and all materials are available on the company's website, celsiusholdingsinc.com, as well as on the SEC's website, sec.gov. As a reminder, an audio replay of this call will be available later today, and can be accessed with the same live webcast link used to join today's call. Please be aware that this call may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on forecasts, expectations, and other information available to management at this time.\n\nThese statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including many that are beyond the company's control. Except to the extent as required by law, Celsius Holdings undertakes no obligations and disclaims any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review in full our Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC for additional information. Additionally, management will share operating results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures that we use, such as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations of these measures to our results as reported in accordance with GAAP are detailed in our earnings release for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Fieldly: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This morning, Celsius reported a 37% year-over-year increase in revenue for the first quarter of 2024, totaling $355.7 million for the period, a new first quarter revenue record for the company. Celsius alone was responsible for approximately 47% of the entire energy drink category growth year-over-year in the first quarter. And as we reported in this morning's press release, Celsius now holds an 11.5 share in MULOC for the four weeks period ending April 14, according to Circana. This is a full point higher than the Q4 2023, and four points higher than one year ago. These results on their own are very strong, especially after growing at a triple-digit for the past three consecutive years.\n\nEven so, our first quarter revenue would have been higher, except that it was adversely affected due to inventory movements by our largest customer, which is beyond our control. The year-over-year inventory variation is attributive to elevated first quarter 2023 restocking, which we believe was meant to compensate for the fourth quarter 2022 destocking, and to prepare for a robust spring reset that were planned in 2023. However, no such first quarter restocking and spring reload in was observed this year. Absent these effects, we would have seen a higher growth rate. Ongoing inventory fluctuations may be expected in subsequent quarters because our largest distributor constitutes approximately 62% of our total North America business during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAll these inventory fluctuations caused noise in our sequential quarterly revenue figures. What's important to focus on here is that Celsius is constantly on shelves, stocked cold, stocked high with a 98.4% ACV. And our category across all tracked channels and untracked channels continues to grow. We introduced several new flavor innovations since the beginning of this year, including Galaxy Vibe, which may be our most refreshing and delicious flavor yet, as well as the CELSIUS Essentials line, which began its national distribution in January, and has now achieved a 54.5% ACV and a 5.5 point share increase since we last reported, in February. We estimate that retailers' spring resets were approximately one-third complete at the end of the quarter.\n\nAnd once concluded we're expecting our best shelf space gains in the company history. The importance of these space gain increases, and placements, and improvements cannot be overstated. The visual impact of multiple full shelves of cold CELSIUS in convenience stores and coolers, and in the grocery shelves is a powerful in-store billboard, and showcases our portfolio. The full effect of these shelf resets is expected to be reflected in the scanner data beginning in July. In March, we launched a new incentive program with Pepsi that further aligns our shared interest within the energy category, including alignment around priorities, and delivering a program that will contribute to our long-term goal of becoming the number one energy drinks brand in the world.\n\nAs we prepare for our 100 Days of Summer campaign, we are well-positioned with the best-in-store presence in company history, the most refreshing products, and some great marketing initiatives, which I'll discuss later in the call, and as just noted, a strong aligned partnership with our North America distribution partner. Celsius' share in MULOC in the most recent four-week data, as of April 14, as stated, was 11.5 share, an increase of approximately four points compared to year-ago period. We're pleased with our continued share growth across all tracked channels. As we shared on our last earnings call, there are 12 major U.S. markets where Celsius maintains a 15-point share or greater, and we are within just a few points of 15 share in several additional markets.\n\nWith our growth and expansion, we're adding more talented people. And already this year, we've increased our sales and key accounts team by approximately 85%. By the end of this year, we're expecting to have three times as many sales staff compared to this time last year, supporting our growth and the opportunities we see ahead. Our world-class operation teams continue to drive efficiencies to reduce freight and raw material cost savings this quarter, contributing to our highest gross margin to date, at 51.2%. Turning to pricing, we have generally maintained flat pricing on a per-volume basis across our portfolio, while strategically promoting our new 16-ounce line of CELSIUS Essentials drive trial. And the reduced pricing and scanner data reflects CELSIUS Essentials' promotions, and the increased mix of variety packs into our overall sales, which come with a lower per-ounce cost. A hand pouring a cool can of a carbonated non-alcoholic beverage with a smiley face on it.\n\nWe continue to consider strategic pricing and promotional opportunities that will allow us to maintain our premium position in the category, while maintaining velocity. With that said, we continue to review and monitor both our distribution infrastructure and the commodity environment across the back-half of 2024, and into 2025. Celsius new product innovation this year is the best-tasting and most refreshing beverages we've ever created. A new favorite here is CELSIUS Galaxy Vibe, which joins other excellent 2024 additions in our 12-ounce line, including Blue Raspberry Lemonade, Sparkling Raspberry Peach, and Astro Vibe. We are very pleased with the strong retailers supporting our initiatives rolling out our 16-ounce line of CELSIUS Essentials, which now has reached approximately 54.5% ACV as of mid April with availability increasing across the country.\n\nCELSIUS ON The Go powders continues to perform well with a recent innovation with refreshing strawberry coconut and blueberry lemonade being our top two performers. We have more CELSIUS On The Go powder innovation plan for this year and continue to see great opportunities with this line. Non-tracked channels including club, ecomm, and foodservice continue to be tailwinds to our overall growth. Club sales in the first quarter increased 36% to $63 million compared to $46.5 million in the same period in 2023. Sales on Amazon increased 30% year over year to $28 million in the first quarter, up $21.8 million in the prior period. Celsius ended the first quarter with a 20.2 share compared to Monster with a 20 share and Red Bull with a 12.3 share according to Stackline 12-weekd data ending March 30th,2024.\n\nApproximately 12% of Celsius sales through Pepsi in the quarter was through the foodservice channel with especially strong sales in restaurants, recreation, lodging, and gaming locations. International sales, which do not include Canada, increased 42% in the quarter to $16.2 million. Celsius launched in Canada, which began in January, continues to exceed expectations. And, we recently achieved a 5.5 share to the first two periods of 2024 according to Nielsen. In the first quarter, Celsius announced plans to expand in Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, and United Kingdom, executing our stated strategy to pursue measured international growth, balancing investment levels in new markets. I am excited to say that as of April, Celsius is now officially available in select gyms and retailers across the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nSales in Australia and New Zealand as well as France are planned to gradually begin in the fourth quarter of 2024 with [spaced] (ph) expansion across the countries in 2025. Finally, we produced some fantastic marketing activations recently including Celsius Cosmic Desert event in Coachella, which hosted celebrities and influencers as well as performance by leading artists. Celsius was also featured in a recent Saturday night live opening skit, making clear that Celsius is the top-of-mind functional energy brand in pop culture. And, just last weekend, we activated our global partnership with Ferrari at the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix. Congratulations to the Ferrari team for their podium finish. I'll now turn the call over to Celsius' Chief Financial Officer, Jarrod Langhans to discuss our first quarter financial results.\n\nJarrod?\n\nJarrod Langhans: Thank you, John. Celsius delivered another record selling quarter, exceeding our expectations and producing strong returns while we grew the business and levered in certain areas. Revenue for the three months ended March 31st, 2024, was approximately $355.7 million, an increase of 37% from $259.9 million in the prior-year period. To put this growth rate into historical context, when Monster Energy achieved $1.3 billion in net sales, they grew revenue 30% the following year. Adjusted for the inventory fluctuations John mentioned previously, Celsius would have grown at an even higher rate in the first quarter of 2024. North American revenue, which includes the United States and Canada, was $339.5 million, an increase of 37% from the same period last year.\n\nInternational revenue grew 42% to $16.2 million as velocity continued to increase. We attribute our sales volume growth for the quarter to several key factors including our ability to drive increased consumer demand, strong innovation, and excellent in-store execution by our key account and field sales teams. Continued growth in the club, ecommerce, and foodservice channels also served as a solid driver of our revenue growth in the quarter as did strong year over year share gains of more than 69% or four points in the convenience and gas channel. Gross profit in the first quarter increased 60% to $182.2 million, up from $113.8 million in the prior-year period. Gross profit margins in the first quarter were 51.2% of revenues compared to 43.8% for the prior-year period.\n\nThe improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to reduced freight and raw material cost. First quarter freight cost as a percentage of net invoice sales decreased 120 basis year over year. And cost of goods sold decreased 470 basis points. As we look to the remainder of the year, we have a number of key drivers that we are monitoring including fuel cost which has been rising, other commodity cost such as aluminum and our promotional calendar. As a result, we are taking a conservative approach to the remainder of the year and continue to stick with our commentary from February where we noted that gross margins in the high 40s was very achievable, but that we are not ready move too far from that expectation until we got further into the year.\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the quarter were 21% of revenue. We have hired a significant number of new team members, and are on track to fill the remaining open positions by the end of Q2. But based on timing, we did see some benefit in Q1, which was slightly below where we expected to be, and three points higher than the same period in 2023. We will continue to invest and plan to maintain investment in this area as we expand further into our 31 Drill Deep markets, and internationally. As we continue to grow, our investment in sales and marketing will remain within the 20% to 23% range. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2024 were approximately $23.2 million, an increase of 9% relative to Q1 2023. As a percentage of sales, G&A was 7%, compared to 8% in the prior-year period as we continue to leverage and due to lower third-party costs, such as legal fees.\n\nAs we look across the reminder of the year, we would anticipate some ebbs and flows within G&A, but remain confident that we will be able to leverage this area in 2024. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased 81% to approximately $88 million in the first quarter, compared to $48.7 million in the prior-year period, driven substantially by revenue growth and increase in margins, and our continued leverage across SG&A. Net income attributed to common shareholders increased 106% to $65 million in the quarter or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to $0.13 in the prior-year period. We ended the quarter with approximately $879.5 million of cash on hand, which continues to accrue interest, and remains available for strategic growth initiatives. Cash flows provided operating activities totaled $135 million in the first quarter, which compares to negative $14 million in net cash provided by operating activities in the prior-year period.\n\nWe will continue to invest in our working capital as well as CapEx around coolers and our fleet to drive further growth, but we do see a greater opportunity to continue to drive strong cash flow growth across 2024. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\n\nSee also\n\n12 Good Cheapest Cigarette Brands In 2024 and\n\n15 Countries with English as Official Language in the World.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Millennials are a driving force within the global economy. Younger generations are splurging more often, which creates opportunities for companies that can win their loyalty.\n\nSome corporations will continue to attract consumer spending from multiple generations. However, some relatively new brands are gobbling up market share from their competitors.\n\nKnowing what millennials want can help investors generate long-term returns. While many businesses have millennial customer bases, these three Millennial stocks are enticing money magnets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

The company has millions of product listings that can arrive at your door within a day or two. The tech giant was a big hit before Millennials, but it has staying power for multiple generations.\n\nThe company continues to grow despite having a large market share in the e-commerce industry. Revenue increased by 13% year-over-year (YoY) in Q1 2024, as sales in North America and international markets remained strong.\n\nAmazon Web Services also performed well in the quarter and grew by 17% YoY. This cloud computing segment will continue to attract money from businesses. Some of these companies are Millennial-owned, but many of them serve Millennials. Artificial intelligence is also fueling the rising demand for cloud computing.\n\nAnalysts believe the stock can continue to march higher as it wins more consumers within the demographic. The stock is projected to gain 16% from current levels. It\u2019s rated as a Strong Buy among 41 analysts.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nMillennials need to buy sneakers and clothing, and they\u2019ll gravitate toward trendy, innovative companies. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) fits the bill as it continues to gain market share from bigger rivals with its HOKA and UGG product lines.\n\nAlthough the stock is currently in the middle of a correction, it\u2019s still a leader. Deckers Outdoor shares are up 30% year-to-date and have surged by 503% over the past five years. Revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased by 16% YoY to reach a record $1.56 billion. Net income growth was also solid, as profits soared by 40% YoY.\n\nMillennials aren\u2019t the only ones who believe in the company. Analysts are projecting an 11% upside from current levels and have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The highest price target of $1,110 per share implies a 29% upside from current levels. Deckers Outdoor trades at a reasonable 31 P/E ratio and has demonstrated it can improve profit margins. Net profit margins came in at 25.0% in Q3 FY24.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nThe sports beverage is capturing more market share and continues to fly off the shelves. Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers a healthier alternative to other sports drinks. Millennials and Gen Z consumers are more conscious about their health and have been grabbing this drink in force.\n\nRevenue more than doubled in full-year 2023. Sales were up 95% YoY in Q4 2023, reaching $347 million. The company also strengthened its profit margins. Celsius Holdings reported $39.1 million in Q4 2023 net income compared to a $28.2 million net loss in the same period last year.\n\nIts stock has soared along with the drink\u2019s success. The stock is up 45% year-to-date and has soared almost 5,000% over the past five years. CELH shares currently trade at a 69 forward P/E ratio. The beverage company\u2019s continued expansion into international markets should create more opportunities and lead to high revenue growth for several years.

Celsius' launch in Canada, which began in January, continues to exceed expectations, and we recently achieved a 5.5 share through the first 2 periods of 2024, according to Nielsen. \r\nIn the first quarter, Celsius announced plans to expand in Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand and United Kingdom, executing our stated strategy to pursue measured international growth, balancing investment levels in new markets. I'm excited to say that as of April, Celsius is now officially available in select gyms and retailers across the United Kingdom and Ireland. Sales in Australia and New Zealand, as well as France, are planned to gradually begin in the fourth quarter of 2024, with phased expansion across the countries in 2025. \r\nFinally, we produced some fantastic marketing activations recently, including Celsius Cosmic Desert event in Coachella, which hosted celebrities and influencers as well as performers (sic) [performances] by leading artists. Celsius was also featured in a recent Saturday Night Live opening skit, making clear that Celsius is the top-of-mind functional energy brand in pop culture. And just last weekend, we activated our global partnership with Ferrari at the Formula One Miami Grand Prix. Congratulations to the Ferrari team for their podium finish. \r\nI'll now turn the call over to Celsius' Chief Financial Officer, Jarrod Langhans, to discuss our first quarter financial results. Jerry?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nThank you, John. Celsius delivered another record-setting quarter, exceeding our expectations and producing strong returns while we grew the business and levered in certain areas. \r\nRevenue for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024, was approximately $355.7 million, an increase of 37% from $259.9 million in the prior year period. To put this growth rate into historical context, when Monster Energy achieved $1.3 billion in net sales, they grew revenue 30% the following year. Adjusted for the inventory fluctuations John mentioned previously, Celsius would have grown at an even higher rate in the first quarter of 2024.\r\nNorth American revenue, which includes the United States and Canada, was $339.5 million, an increase of 37% from the same period last year. International revenue grew 42% to $16.2 million as velocity continued to increase. We attribute our sales volume growth for the quarter to several key factors, including our ability to drive increased consumer demand, strong innovation and excellent in-store execution by our key account and field sales teams. Continued growth in the club, e-commerce and foodservice channels also served as a solid driver of our revenue growth in the quarter, as did strong year-over-year share gains of more than 69% or 4 points in the convenience and gas channel. \r\nGross profit in the first quarter increased 60% to $182.2 million, up from $113.8 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margins in the first quarter were 51.2% of revenues compared to 43.8% for the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to reduced freight and raw material costs. First quarter freight costs as a percentage of net invoice sales decreased 120 basis points year-over-year, and cost of goods sold decreased 470 basis points. \r\nAs we look to the remainder of the year, we have a number of key drivers that we are monitoring, including fuel costs, which have been rising; other commodity costs, such as aluminum; and our promotional calendar. As a result, we are taking a conservative approach to the remainder of the year and continue to stick with our commentary from February, where we noted that gross margins in the high 40s was very achievable, but that we were not ready to move too far from that expectation until we got further into the year. \r\nSales and marketing expenses for the quarter were 21% of revenue. We have hired a significant number of new team members and are on track to fill the remaining open positions by the end of Q2. But based on timing, we did see some benefit in Q1, which was slightly below where we expected to be and 3 points higher than the same period in 2023. We will continue to invest and plan to maintain investment in this area as we expand further into our 31 [drill deep] markets and internationally. As we continue to grow, our investment in sales and marketing will remain within the 20% to 23% range. \r\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2024 were approximately $23.2 million, an increase of 9% relative to Q1 2023. As a percentage of sales, G&A was 7% compared to 8% in the prior year period as we continue to leverage, and due to lower third-party costs, such as legal fees. As we look across the remainder of the year, we would anticipate some ebbs and flows within G&A, but we remain confident that we will be able to leverage this area in 2024. \r\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased 81% to approximately $88 million in the first quarter compared to $48.7 million in the prior year period, driven substantially by revenue growth and increase in margins and our continued leverage across SG&A. Net income attributed to common shareholders increased 106% to $65 million in the quarter or $0.27 per diluted share compared to $0.13 in the prior year period. We ended the quarter with approximately $879.5 million of cash on hand, which continues to accrue interest and remains available for strategic growth initiatives. \r\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled $135 million in the first quarter, which compares to negative $14 million in net cash provided by operating activities in the prior year period. We will continue to invest in our working capital as well as CapEx around coolers in our fleet to drive further growth, but we do see a great opportunity to continue to drive strong cash flow growth across 2024. \r\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from Jefferies.\n\nKaumil S. Gajrawala\n\nA question on inventories as we're thinking about 2Q, maybe how businesses progressed from a consumption perspective in 2Q. But also our inventory is now tight and low as we're going into another 2/3 of shelf resets to maybe some of the $20 million reverse in 2Q. Can you just give some context around that?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Great question. We did state that in our prepared remarks in regards to some of the inventory fluctuation with our partner. We don't control the inventory levels, but we do feel that everyone is optimizing inventory levels as we move forward, and we'll see how that evolves. If you look at our inventory levels over the last 15 months, looking at the -- especially the cash flow statement, we've optimized our inventory levels as well, about $47 million. So I think every business is going to be optimizing. \r\nI think, really, the most important thing when we look at it is keeping the shelf stocked, most importantly keeping the shelves cold and just preparing for this -- the reset season that's underway as we continue to progress forward. And the scan data is really strong, especially last week at the register, according to Circana. So we feel like we're in a good shape. But to predict where inventory levels move is just really difficult for our partner. I don't know, Jarrod, if you have any further comments to add.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nLike John said, depletions are really good. They're rock solid. But as I look at April, I'd say this is kind of a new normal for us at the moment. We'll see where our partner goes from here, but I wouldn't bake in a reversal of what we've seen.\n\nKaumil S. Gajrawala\n\nOkay. Got it. And then margins were quite substantially ahead of plan. Was there anything onetime in there? Or is it just sort of leverage off your growth?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Jarrod, why don't you talk about the margins?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes. I mean, you know I always point to freight as something that fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, and that's definitely been something that, if you look back over the last 3 years, it has been. We've been able to keep it within kind of a set of guardrails, but we did see some good freight rates this quarter. We'll continue to look to optimize that, but some of that will be dependent upon fuel costs as we look out into the back half of the year. \r\nWe have seen some good activity in terms of leveraging our business and our scale around raw materials. But at the same time, we are moving into a much higher promotional time period with 100 Days of Summer. So that's why we kind of said we're not ready to put the line in the sand at the rate we were able to deliver in Q1. We're always going to try to deliver that or better, and we do have a kind of a long-term goal that we're looking to get to. \r\nBut I would say, as we look out to Q2, Q3, Q4, we're kind of sticking with what we said at the end of February, which was kind of that high end of the 40s and not quite locking in into the 50s yet.\n\nOperator\n\nMark Astrachan from Stifel.\n\nMark Stiefel Astrachan\n\nI wanted to go back to that last question, the one that we're getting a lot today as far as the timing of this inventory stock. So if I do some rough math, it looks like you've undershipped demand, per scanner data, recently in the last 2 quarters. 1Q, obviously, when you're lumping in the rollout into Canada. Would you state that even more pronounced? So I guess the question is, a, what do you say to that? Meaning that we saw -- kind of see where end demand is versus what your sales are, and your sales are a lot lower. \r\nAnd two, as you think about how Pepsi is managing shelves, does this have an impact? Have you seen any impact from a service-level standpoint on how to stock and whatnot? And kind of how do you work with them to make sure that you prevent that, assuming that you haven't seen it yet, but may, given where trends seem to be moving?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Mark, I'll take the beginning of the question. When you look at the inventory levels, I think our partners are at really good inventory levels right now. We're maintaining deliveries, we're keeping products in stock. We're seeing scan data. We just broke a record on the share gain to 11.5. So product is flowing. I think we're both getting -- learning about each other, our supply chains, and looking to further optimize. \r\nSo I can't speak for our partner, but they are maintaining supply levels, servicing customers. We have greater ACV. The resets have gone well, the ones that have been reset so far. So -- and we're further working on programs with 100 Days of Summer, working on further displays and NCAP programs. \r\nSo I think we feel really good where we're at. You're going to see some optimization on both sides. Like I said to Kaumil is that we did optimize our inventory as well, about $47 million in the last 15 months, if you look at the cash flow statement. \r\nSo in regards to shelves, we're not seeing out of stocks. You're always going to have some, that's just part of the business, but always out there's ways to further optimize.And I think we're in a -- we're in a really good place. We have good inventory levels now. We feel confident in our inventory levels and confident in the Pepsi inventory levels supporting our growth.\n\nMark Stiefel Astrachan\n\nGot it. Okay. And then I guess just staying on the point, was there any change in the inventory levels that Pepsi held through the March quarter that was notable? I say that in part just out of curiosity and partly with the view that distribution points continue to expand. Obviously, you talked about what you did through March 31, implying a pretty substantial increase in distribution points as you head to summer. \r\nSo it would just be odd to me that you would reduce the amount of inventory for Pepsi. And I guess just how do you think about that progression through? I know you talked about April being a little bit weaker. So I guess, sort of related to the first question, but kind of how does the timing of that worked through? Did they hold more at the beginning of the quarter and less at the end of the quarter?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I mean we haven't spoken about April being weaker. I think Jarrod was talking about maintaining inventory levels with our partners, maintaining as we enter the second quarter. We're going to have to see how this how this plays, how the quarter unfolds. I think with optimizing inventories, we're getting more efficient. We're able to ship product in less number of days. Prior, we're running 14 days. And now, in many cases, we're shipping within 7. So we're just finding further ways to optimize our supply chain. So that's going to impact some of the revenue recognition standards in order as we continue to progress forward. \r\nBut I think the most important thing to really look at is what's taking place within the scanner data for the end user and the end customer, which continues to maintain. It seems to be extremely strong, and we got good momentum heading in, especially the 100 Days of Summer, double the sales staff, great refreshing innovation and a bunch of great marketing assets and activities. I don't know, Jarrod, is there any more color you want to add on there?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nI'm aligned with you. I think we're in good shape. We haven't seen any service issues as they optimize their system. As long as they're getting product on the shelf, that's what we're most concerned with.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeff Van Sinderen from B. Riley.\n\nJeffrey Wallin Van Sinderen\n\nI wanted to circle back to a comment you made on markets where you're getting close to a 15% market share. Maybe any more color you can add on that? I guess what specifically you've done in those markets to achieve that and plans to apply those initiatives to other markets?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes, Jeff, great question. It's really exciting that now we're in 12 markets, major metropolitan markets in the U.S. right now that are over 15 share. And then we have several additional markets that are getting close to that range. So what we're seeing is just really further collaboration with our Pepsi partners, further building out our sales team and marketing teams and really using our methodological approach to marketing and activation, which has worked well. It's activating the consumer where they live, work and play, disrupting the path to purchase, building that awareness, getting that trial, and we have such great flavors and a great product and a great brand that we build that loyal consumer. \r\nAnd when we're seeing our Celsius consumers further increasing their consumption levels as we've further built out our availability, we're seeing category growth or driving category growth, about 47% of the category growth is coming from new to category, and Celsius is creating that. So really exciting. It's really about gaining that additional distribution and really closing the gap within convenience, and we've talked about that for many years. We've done well in large format and online and with gyms and health clubs. And now we're really -- next phase is really closing the gap in convenience and getting better placement. You're seeing the share numbers start to increase there.\n\nJeffrey Wallin Van Sinderen\n\nOkay. Great. And then I just wanted to circle back to spring resets as well. Maybe you could just speak a little bit more about where you're seeing the most significant gains. Maybe touch on that in terms of SKUs, spacings, quality of shelf locations, that sort of thing.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I think when you look at the resets, we're really excited. It's going to be convenience is the biggest opportunity. So we're expecting some pretty good growth within the convenience channel as well as our existing accounts. \r\nAs an example, in Publix, we just moved over from the HPC to the energy category and the energy set. And we've gained further replacement in front checkout coolers, and we're working with several other retailers. More to come on that. We expect full resets to be done by the end of June, but really looking to gain further placements in all accounts. The key accounts team has been extremely positive this year.\n\nJeffrey Wallin Van Sinderen\n\nOkay. Great. And then just as a follow-up to that. As far as the coolers scaling, what are the plans for coolers this year? And also, is there an opportunity to get into a lot more coolers that are maybe not Celsius coolers at this point?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes, I think that's a huge opportunity, and that's really partnering with PepEnergy and working really closely with our Pepsi partner, gaining more distribution and availability in cold placements. Our key accounts team is working on branded Celsius coolers, that's a big initiative. We're not going to put a number out, but they're a substantial number we're looking to place. And in regards to the first quarter, I think the team's placed almost 3,000 coolers. But lots of opportunities with coolers we expect to really continue the momentum as we go forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jonathan Keypour from Bank of America.\n\nJonathan Daniel Keypour\n\nI've got a couple on margins and then a couple on sales. I guess on margins, just looking at the chart on aluminum, I think it's up pretty meaningfully year-over-year. Can you guys give us any kind of magnitude of COGS exposure to aluminum and, I guess, a sense of timing about maybe where those higher costs will flow through?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes, Jon, and then I'll turn it over to Jarrod.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes. So a couple of things. Let me jump on an inventory question that was asked. Just to clarify, when I was talking about April, I was talking about days on hand is consistent from March into April. So that wasn't a knock-on what we're seeing. In April, as we continue to see our resets happen, we're doing very well and you can see the consumer data. We continue to get more SKUs. We continue to get more space, et cetera. So just a clarity there. That was more of a days on hand comment more than anything.\r\nIn terms of the aluminum, you've seen some fuel costs go up. We have locked in a lot of our aluminum pricing. So we're in pretty good shape there. So we tend to lock that in around Q4 of every year.\n\nJonathan Daniel Keypour\n\nOkay. Cool. On margins, again, just in terms of the amendments to the Pepsi agreement. I guess what are the other implications to the margin from here? What -- is there a benefit? Is it likely diluted? Anything. Like just a sense of what it may or may not do to margins.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes. So the incentive program is for Pepsi, it's incentive-based, right? So obviously, we're going to get something for it. So the idea is to really drive what our priorities are, what their priorities are across energy. We want to be the #1 energy brand in the world. It's also really to drive alignment. \r\nAnd so from that perspective, it's an incentive program. So the idea is to really push us to the next level. There is -- obviously, it's an incentive program, so there is obviously a cost to that program. So it's something that I would look to see ramping up across, call it, the first 6, 7, 8 months of the year, and to really be cruising by the time we get to the back part of the year.\n\nJonathan Daniel Keypour\n\nCool. And sorry, just a couple more on revenue. I guess, specifically in Costco, that became in a bit light, same as on foodservice. Just wondering about the sequential decline in Costco and the flat foodservice, any drivers there that you can point to or what to expect going forward, please?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes. So Costco, really the club channel, we probably should have called that out last quarter, but we did see a really good Thanksgiving week and Black Friday. So we had -- the team really activated phenomenally there. So we did get a bit of a bump there in Q4 versus Q1. Q1 does also tend to be a little slower in the club channel. \r\nWhat was the other part? The foodservice. Foodservice remains strong. That can be a little lumpy at times. But being up at that 12-ish range is pretty good for us. And we do -- we are seeing gains in areas like convenience. So we're seeing gains in some of the areas that are, from a scale perspective, bigger. So as we see gains there, you may not see the same percentage growth from 1%, but we are seeing dollar growth.\n\nJonathan Daniel Keypour\n\nCool. And then just last one on the shelf resets coming up. So it sounds like 1/3 down already, 2/3 coming, so basically, a doubling of what's already been put in the -- or more than doubling what's been put in the trade already. \r\nI guess, in the Nielsen, you can see that TDPs in the average number of items looks great. But if it's going to keep moving up from there, I guess, is that going to be -- does that kind of imply new flavors or innovations coming to market by the end of the year? Or is it going to be like double, triple facing, that kind of thing?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I think the goal is to gain double, triple facing. So a lot of the resets -- average items per store might not increase -- show up in the scanner data. But we're gaining those secondary, third placements and better placements within retailers. So as an example, like within -- I mentioned Publix, moving from HPC into the energy aisle, also gaining additional availability and placements in cold checkouts. That's an example of a transitional move. And also, we're looking at other retailers as well. \r\nSo we do have innovation coming in this year, which we're launching. We launched a CELSIUS Essentials. We got Galaxy Vibe, a variety of other great flavors. But we're really -- I think the bulk of the resets you're going to be seeing them by double, triple facing within stores and gaining a secondary placements.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.\n\nMichael Scott Lavery\n\nJust wanted to come back to the inventory for a minute. And I think you've been clear not to expect a snapback or an inventory restocking. But should we expect any more destocking? I know you said the inventory levels feel about right, but how low could it go? Is that something we should watch out for?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I mean I can't control that or we can't control that. I think it's -- sales are flowing, sales are strong at the register. So it seems to be like the balancing has been finalized. But who knows what next week or the week after happens? But I think, right now, it seems somewhat stable as we ended the -- ending March.\n\nMichael Scott Lavery\n\nOkay. And just back on the incentive plan, you've given some color on that. I know you don't want to be too specific, but can you maybe touch on what the rationale was? What prompted you -- what problem was it fixing because, obviously, there was great momentum in place. What does this change qualitatively that makes it seem kind of worth changing the terms?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I think when you look at the partnership, we're heading in really at a great point within the -- where Celsius is within the energy category. We just broke that 10 share. You're looking at ways to further partner and incentivize our distributor and our partners. And we do that with our employees. We do have retailers and our distributors. So this is like a standard practice we've done in the past. So I don't think it's added anything out of our standard course of business. We've done a variety of incentive programs. And it's -- this further aligns us with additional prioritization within Pep Energy. Also solidifies this -- as more incentives, we both win together. And it really achieves our long-term goals. We feel really confident in where we are and what better way to incentivize both parties to continue to drive Celsius forward. I don't know, Jarrod, do you want to add anything else.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nI agree with you. It's really about making sure we're all fully aligned together to take that next step and to really go after the #2 and #1 players in the market. We need to do it together.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nPeter, are you here?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jon Andersen from William Blair.\n\nJon Robert Andersen\n\nI just wanted to ask about the category growth that you're driving. I mean, you're driving half of the growth in the category, energy category. And I'm curious to know to what extent you're seeing that come through? As kind of new consumers into the category, to what extent you think you're driving buy rate through new occasions? And then how the brand is performing overall from a household penetration and the kind of repeat rates you're seeing? So just digging into some of the metrics underpinning the growth that you're seeing both for the category that the brand is driving, but also to your brands.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. No, great question. And it's exciting because we're -- when you look at like brand shifting, we're not seeing a substantial amount of our growth coming from brand shifting. It really is incremental and it's increasing the user intensification. Our core consumers are consuming more. And then it's about 35%, the latest day we had is intensification of more consumption of our core or base. And then new to category for us was 42%, and this was as of the end of March. So really seeing the 23% brand shift. \r\nSo we're expanding the category. We're changing the way consumers think about energy as well. And we've seen that talk about Jersey Mike's and Dunkin' Donuts, and really the partnership with Pepsi allows us to take advantage of this opportunity. We have some of the most refreshed -- we feel we have the most refreshing energy drinks in the world. And it's showing. \r\nWe're bringing new consumers who are growing in the category. We got a lot of great attributes within the brand. We look at better-for-you trends. Celsius has over 7 essential vitamins. If you look at how we all want our foods and beverages to have more function, Celsius delivers on that with our thermogenic properties. \r\nAnd then you also look at fitness, this health and wellness trend, and we're all about live and fit and living life to the fullest. So I think we're really well positioned. And we haven't really seen that change within the user intensification as well as the increase to new to category over the last, really over the last 6 to almost a year now.\n\nJon Robert Andersen\n\nGreat. That's helpful. And on these 33-or-so drill-down markets, can you talk about what you're doing there -- or 31 drill deep markets, what you're doing there that's different at present? And kind of what you're expecting in terms of, I guess, maybe share results as a measuring stick?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes, I think you talked about household penetration and that shows -- as we've continued to drive forward with our targeted marketing programs and as well as our distribution gains, our household penetration has reached an all-time high, most recently at a 29.7% household penetration. So really proud of the team and all the hard work they've been doing. \r\nWe take an approach of a drill-deep strategy. We're not going to get into specific strategies because a lot of competitors are listening on the call. But we have a proprietary blend of a special formula here which starts with the employee and a great product that we promote and market. And it's all about touching consumers where they live, work and play, creating awareness, creating trial and then creating loyalty.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS.\n\nPeter K. Grom\n\nCan you hear me now?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes, we can hear you. Excellent.\n\nPeter K. Grom\n\nAll right. Cool. So I guess just a couple of follow-ups here. Just in terms of the inventory dynamic, Jarrod, can you just remind us what we're kind of comping against from a year ago perspective? Like I guess you might not have visibility on what types you might do or how will manage it sequentially. \r\nBut when we just think of how this dynamic evolved last year. I think it kind of held in 2Q, grow again in 3Q. So does this -- should we expect kind of this gap versus standard data to kind of continue as we move through the year? Or would you expect it to kind of be more aligned at this point?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes. I mean, remember, we were just getting started last year and so we're still learning each other. And obviously, as everybody in CPG, it's all about optimizing the supply chain to make sure we're spending our dollars wisely. So we did see some buildup in Q1 like we talked about, roughly $25 million. Across Q2 and Q3, we saw some minor buildup, and it kind of stuck steady for kind of Q2, Q3, Q4. To Mark's earlier point, there was some innovation in there, so that could have -- maybe there would have been some inventory taken down in Q4 if it weren't for that as they were optimizing. And then across Q1, clearly, there's been some optimization occurring again. \r\nNo issue with having product on the shelf. And we do have KPIs that we work together to maintain in terms of service standards, and so we have no complaints there. And we're fully -- believe they're fully committed, we're fully committed. So we're very happy with how things are going there. But if there's opportunity to optimize, like John said, we'll do it and they're welcome to do it, too. So I think what I mentioned with April is the days on hand that we saw kind of in March, kind of were maintained in April. But the consumer is there, if they can maintain inventory levels,and keep the product on the shelf, then that's -- we're comfortable with that.\n\nPeter K. Grom\n\nOkay. Great. And then just following up on kind of the shelf resets and kind of the market share metrics you mentioned. I think you said 1/3 of the shelf resets were done by March. I mean when did those actually take place in 1Q? I'm just trying to understand whether there is a benefit, including kind of these 4-week share figures that you mentioned on the 4Q call. I think it was the same 11.5% that you mentioned in the latest release today. So shares, kind of, on a monthly basis, held steady. \r\nAnd then I think as we look ahead, is there anything you can share in terms of the phasing of the benefits? I know you touched on but we won't see the full benefit until July. But kind of where are we now in the first week of May? What's really the progression look like? And is there really any way to put into context what you actually expect in terms of track growth or market share performance as these resets happen?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes, I think [jamming] to 11 5. I think the last poll, maybe been in the last couple of weeks is more like 11 8. So we do continue to see the number climb as we go through April and into May. So we are seeing good progress. As those resets continue to happen, we'll benefit. Once they're fully baked in, we'll really see where we are once we get to early July, once everything is baked in. So we continue to be on track. \r\nThere's been some rumblings out there that it's been a little slower in terms of resets this year versus prior years. But we're going to have the best space gains that we've had in the history of the company. We're super excited about it. We're -- our key account team and our sales guys are working diligently with all of our customers.

        "title": "VDC: Strong and Steady Consumer Staples ETF",
        "content": "Whether it\u2019s Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Hershey (NYSE:HSY), Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), or Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), consumer staples stocks are reporting strong earnings, and they look like steady, reliable performers for the long haul during a time of market volatility.\n\nThe Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:VDC) is a major consumer staples ETF that allows investors to gain diversified exposure to a broad range of these steady-eddy blue-chip stocks.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on VDC based on the reliable revenue and earnings of its holdings, the persistent demand for the products these holdings sell, and the ETF\u2019s strong performance amid a volatile market. I\u2019m also bullish on VDC based on its low fee, long dividend history, and the strong Smart Scores its top holdings boast.\n\nWhat Is the VDC ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nVDC was launched by index fund pioneer Vanguard more than 20 years ago, in January 2004. In that time, the fund has grown to $6.5 billion in assets under management (AUM). According to Vanguard, VDC \u201cseeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks in the consumer staples sector.\u201d\n\nVDC\u2019s underlying index \u201cincludes stocks of companies that provide direct-to-consumer products that, based on consumer spending habits, are considered nondiscretionary.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll get into what types of stocks this encompasses in the section below.\n\nVDC\u2019s Top Holdings are Holding Up\n\nVDC owns 105 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 60.7% of the fund.\u00a0Below, you\u2019ll find an overview of VDC\u2019s top 10 holdings from TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, VDC owns a group of high-profile, blue-chip U.S. consumer staples stocks.\n\nThe fund owns the makers of everyday household staples like detergents, deodorants, soaps, shampoos, and more, like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Colgate-Palmolive. These companies may not sound like the most exciting in the world, but they sell products that people need every day and are loath to cut from their budgets. This puts them in a strong position no matter how the economic tides ebb and flow from one day to the next.\n\nColgate recently shook off inflation and economic uncertainty to report strong 9.8% organic sales growth for the first quarter and increased pricing of 8.5%, encapsulating the strength these consumer staples stalwarts have in this environment. Colgate also used the strong start to the year as an opportunity to increase revenue guidance for the year.\n\nMeanwhile, VDC has positions in soft drink giants like Coca-Cola and Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), which sell the sodas and other drinks that many people consume on a daily basis, regardless of how the macro economy is doing or where interest rates stand.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Colgate, Coca-Cola recently reported earnings and overcame any macroeconomic challenges, beating on both revenue and earnings. Coca-Cola says that it expects to grow organic revenue by an impressive 8-9% this year, along with comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 11% to 13%.\n\nTobacco stocks like Philip Morris and Altria (NYSE:MO) are in a similarly strong position, as tobacco users buy their products on a routine, habitual basis and are unlikely to eschew this habit just because the economy is slow. Inflation and the uncertain economy aren\u2019t hurting demand for Philip Morris\u2019 red-hot nicotine pouch product Zyn, which saw shipment volume increase by an incredible 79.7% year-over-year during its first quarter of the year.\n\nBig box retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are competitive in any type of economic environment, thanks to their low-cost offerings.\n\nLastly, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the maker of popular snacks like Oreos and Chips Ahoy! is the type of company many consumers will buy products from as an affordable pick-me-up when they may not be able to afford other luxuries in a down economy.\n\nOther notable VDC holdings from beyond the top 10 include Hershey, Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), and Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). Hershey just reported impressive first-quarter earnings in which it brushed off rising cocoa prices to beat estimates. Its earnings grew 3.7% year-over-year, and revenue increased 8.7%.\n\nAs these results show, top consumer staples stocks like these have strong brands and persistent demand to succeed during a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nIn addition to these resilient business models and strong demand, another thing that VDC\u2019s top holdings have in common is their strong Smart Scores.\u00a0The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nEight out of VDC\u2019s top 10 holdings have Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and VDC itself has an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.\n\nLong Dividend History\n\nWhether it\u2019s Pepsi and Coca-Cola or Altria and Philip Morris, many of VDC\u2019s top holdings are lauded for their long dividend histories, so it\u2019s no surprise that VDC is a dividend payer.\n\nVDC currently yields 2.5%. While it\u2019s not a huge dividend yield, it trumps that of the S&P 500 (SPX), which yields 1.4%. Plus, VDC has a reliable track record as a dividend payer, having made dividend payments to its holders for 18 years in a row.\n\nAffordable Expense Ratio\n\nLike many of its Vanguard peers, it features a modest expense ratio of just 0.10% (a 0.09% management fee plus 0.01% in other expenses). This means that an investor in the fund will pay just $10 in fees on an investment of $10,000 annually.\n\nOver time, investing in low-cost funds like this can save investors a considerable amount of money. Assuming the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains its current expense ratio, the investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay just $128 in fees over a 10-year time frame.\n\nHow does this help investors to save? Let\u2019s compare VDC to another consumer staples ETF with a higher expense ratio, the iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:IYK), which has $1.3 billion in AUM and charges an expense ratio of 0.40%. An investor putting $10,000 into IYK will pay $40 in fees annually, and assuming the same parameters as above, this investor will pay a much higher $505 in fees over a 10-year time horizon, illustrating the considerable savings offered by a low-cost fund like VDC.\n\nBelow, you can check out a comparison of VDC and IYK using TipRanks\u2019 ETF Comparison Tool, which allows users to compare up to 20 ETFs at a time based on a variety of inputs.\n\nIs VDC Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, VDC earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 56 Buys, 43 Holds, and six Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VDC stock price target of $220.16 implies 8.8% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: A Sound Choice\n\nI\u2019m bullish on consumer staples and VDC in particular. The economy goes through ups and downs, and the stock market ebbs and flows, but consumers always need the basics that consumer staples companies sell, whether it\u2019s their favorite soft drink from Coca-Cola or Pepsi or toothpaste from Colgate-Palmolive. It may not be the sexiest sector, but these companies have strong and consistent earnings and revenue.\n\nThroughout earnings season, we\u2019ve seen companies like Coca-Cola, Hershey, Philip Morris, Colgate-Palmolive, and other consumer staples names prove this.\n\nI\u2019m also bullish on VDC, specifically because of its holdings\u2019 strong Smart Scores, low expense ratio, and attractive dividend.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) Misses Q1 Revenue Estimates, Stock Drops",
        "content": "Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) Misses Q1 Revenue Estimates, Stock Drops\n\nEnergy drink company Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) fell short of analysts' expectations in Q1 CY2024, with revenue up 36.8% year on year to $355.7 million. It made a GAAP profit of $0.27 per share, down from its profit of $0.40 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Celsius? Find out in our full research report.\n\nCelsius (CELH) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $355.7 million vs analyst estimates of $389.8 million (8.8% miss) Adjusted EBITDA: $88.0 million vs analyst estimates of $72.7 million (21.0% beat) EPS: $0.27 vs analyst estimates of $0.19 (38.9% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 51.2%, up from 43.8% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $18.26 billion\n\nWith its proprietary MetaPlus formula as the basis for key products, Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) offers energy drinks that feature natural ingredients to help in fitness and weight management.\n\nBeverages and Alcohol\n\nThese companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the explosion of alcoholic craft beer drinks or the steady decline of non-alcoholic sugary sodas. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.\n\nSales Growth\n\nCelsius is a small consumer staples company, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefitting from better brand awareness and economies of scale. On the other hand, one advantage is that its growth rates can be higher because it's growing off a small base.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 110% over the last three years was incredible for a consumer staples business. Celsius Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Celsius pulled off a wonderful 36.8% year-on-year revenue growth rate, but its $355.7 million in revenue fell short of Wall Street's rosy estimates. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 42.5% over the next 12 months, an acceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability accounting for key expenses such as marketing and advertising, IT systems, wages, and other administrative costs.\n\nThis quarter, Celsius generated an operating profit margin of 23.4%, up 6.1 percentage points year on year. This increase was encouraging, and we can infer Celsius had stronger pricing power and lower raw materials/transportation costs because its gross margin expanded more than its operating margin. Celsius Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nZooming out, Celsius has done a decent job managing its expenses over the last eight quarters. The company has produced an average operating margin of 8.3%, higher than the broader consumer staples sector. On top of that, its margin has improved by 37.3 percentage points on average over the last year, a great sign for shareholders.\n\nKey Takeaways from Celsius's Q1 Results\n\nWe were impressed by how significantly Celsius blew past analysts' adjusted EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also excited its gross margin outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, its revenue unfortunately missed analysts' expectations. Overall, we think there will be focus on the revenue miss since this is a stock where topline is a key part of the bull case. The stock is down 5.1% after reporting, trading at $74.32 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Celsius right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

The company's net income for the quarter stood at $77.8 million, up 89% from the previous year, and surpassing the estimated $45.39 million. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) also saw a remarkable increase, reaching $0.27, up 108% year-over-year and higher than the estimated $0.19 per share.\n\nStrategic Highlights and Operational Efficiency\n\nCelsius' strategic initiatives have led to increased market share and distribution gains. According to John Fieldly, Chairman and CEO, the company's innovative product offerings have significantly contributed to its top-line growth. CFO Jarrod Langhans highlighted the improved gross margin, which reached 51% in Q1 2024, reflecting efficient cost management and favorable raw material pricing.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket Expansion and Innovation\n\nThe company continues to expand its footprint both domestically and internationally. Notable growth drivers include a 36% increase in club channel sales and a 30% rise in sales on Amazon. Celsius has also launched new products like CELSIUS Blue Razz Lemonade and expanded into new markets such as Canada and the UK, with plans to enter additional countries in 2024.\n\nFinancial Statements Insight\n\nThe balance sheet of Celsius Holdings shows a strong liquidity position, with cash and cash equivalents of $879.498 million as of March 31, 2024. The comprehensive income for the quarter was reported at $63.492 million. These figures demonstrate the company's solid financial health and its ability to sustain growth and shareholder value.\n\nOutlook and Analyst Expectations\n\nThe impressive first quarter results have set a positive tone for the fiscal year. As Celsius continues to innovate and expand, it remains well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for energy drinks. The company's performance is a testament to its effective strategic planning and operational execution, making it a noteworthy contender in the competitive beverage industry.\n\nFor detailed financial figures and future projections, interested parties can access the full earnings report and additional documents through the provided SEC filing link.\n\nThis summary is provided for informational purposes only and reflects the company's performance for the first quarter of 2024.

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.27 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.20 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 35%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.17, delivering a surprise of 6.25%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nCelsius , which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $355.71 million for the quarter ended March 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.53%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $259.94 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nCelsius shares have added about 43.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Celsius?\n\nWhile Celsius has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Celsius: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.28 on $467.47 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.09 on $1.87 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Food - Miscellaneous is currently in the top 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Nomad Foods (NOMD), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 9.\n\nThis frozen foods company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nNomad Foods' revenues are expected to be $870.19 million, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "When Should You Buy Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)?",
        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of 57% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQCM. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s examine Celsius Holdings\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Celsius Holdings\n\nWhat Is Celsius Holdings Worth?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 6.81% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Celsius Holdings today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $73.34, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Celsius Holdings\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCan we expect growth from Celsius Holdings? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Celsius Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in CELH\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CELH, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Celsius Holdings at this point in time.

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Reports First Quarter 2024 Financial Results",
        "content": "Record first quarter revenue of $355.7 million, up 37% year over year Record first quarter gross profit of $182.2 million, up 60% year over year First quarter diluted EPS of $0.27, up 108% year over year\n\nBOCA RATON, Fla., May 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Celsius Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: CELH), maker of CELSIUS\u00ae, the premium lifestyle energy drink formulated to power active lifestyles with ESSENTIAL ENERGY\u2122, today reported record first quarter 2024 financial results.\n\nSummary Financials 1Q 2024 1Q 2023 Change (Millions except for\r\npercentages and EPS) Revenue $355.7 $259.9 37\u00a0% N. America $339.5 $248.6 37\u00a0% International $16.2 $11.3 43\u00a0% Gross Margin 51.2\u00a0% 43.8\u00a0% +740 BPS Net Income $77.8 $41.2 89\u00a0% Net Income att. to \r\nCommon Shareholders $64.8 $31.5 106\u00a0% Diluted EPS $0.27 $0.13 108\u00a0% Adjusted EBITDA* $88.0 $48.7 81\u00a0%\n\nJohn Fieldly, Chairman and CEO of Celsius Holdings, Inc., said: \"Celsius reported its best first quarter ever driving record revenue and contributing 47%1 of the quarterly year-over-year growth in the energy drink category. Our category share of 11.5 percent as of April 142 reflects the early impact of shelf space gains that we are earning from company-record and ongoing retailer resets, which we believe will serve as a flywheel for our continued growth. Celsius product innovation this year has delighted consumers with the most refreshing products we've ever created.\"\n\nJarrod Langhans, Chief Financial Officer of Celsius Holdings, Inc., said: \"Celsius' first quarter revenue of $356 million and year-over-year growth of 37 percent is a record, despite changes in days on hand inventory by our largest customer. Our solid 51 percent first quarter gross margin reflects a balanced and disciplined approach to leveraging while simultaneously building the business and expanding globally, as well as an accelerated benefit from raw materials pricing and reduced freight costs.\"\n\n*The company reports financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), but management believes that disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that management uses to assess our performance, may provide users with additional insights into operating performance. Please see \"Use of Non-GAAP Measures\" and reconciliations of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, both of which can be found below.\n\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER 2024\n\nRevenue for the first quarter increased 37% to $355.7 million compared to $259.9 million for the prior-year period, driven primarily by the North American business and the company's success in sustaining consumer demand growth, delivering unique innovation and overall channel growth, offset in part by inventory movements within our largest distributor where first quarter 2024 inventory days on hand declined versus the fourth quarter resulting in an approximate $20 million impact, while first quarter 2023 revenue benefited from an inventory buildup of approximately $25 million. Ongoing inventory fluctuations may be expected in subsequent quarters because our largest distributor constituted 62% of our total North American sales during the first quarter of 2024. However, retail sales of Celsius in total U.S. MULOC grew by 72.1% in the first quarter of 2024 year over year3, and subsequent-period sales show ongoing consumer demand, as reported by\u00a0Circana for the period ended April 21, 2024, (L1W +48.8% YoY; L4W +51.0% YoY; YTD +67.2% YoY)4. Revenue from\u00a0U.S. and Canadian sales are reported together as North America.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational sales of $16.2 million increased 43% from $11.3 million for the prior-year period, driven by ongoing velocity improvements and product launches.\n\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2024 increased 60% to $182.2 million compared to $113.8 million for the prior-year quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 51% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, up from 44% for the prior-year period, as a result of lower freight and materials costs.\n\nDiluted earnings per share for the first quarter increased 108% to $0.27 compared to $0.13 for the prior-year period, driven by improvements in gross margin and leverage across SG&A.\n\nBUSINESS OPERATIONS & COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS\n\nShare Growth Celsius held an 11.5% share in the energy drink category in total U.S. MULOC for the last four weeks ended April 14, 2024, \u2013 a one-point increase over the prior quarter and approximately four points higher than one year ago5. This share performance delivered quarter-over-quarter sales growth for Celsius of 9.6% during a period when the energy category declined 0.4%. Sugar-free segment sales in the first quarter were approximately 50% of the energy drink category6.\n\nAverage SKUs per retailer increased in the first quarter of 2024 to 20.6 from 13.5 in the prior-year period7.\u00a0TDPs for the quarter grew 55% year over year and 27% sequentially8.\n\nWe estimate that retailers' spring shelf resets were approximately one-third complete as of March 31, and once concluded, we are expecting our best shelf space gains in company history. The importance of these space increases and placement improvements cannot be overstated. The visual impact of multiple, full shelves of cold Celsius in convenience store coolers and on grocery shelves is a powerful in-store billboard and showcases more of the Celsius product portfolio. The full effect of shelf space gains is expected to be reflected in scanner data beginning in July 2024.\n\nGrowth Drivers Club channel sales in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, increased 36% to $63.0 million compared to $46.5 million in the prior-year period.\n\nCelsius sales on Amazon increased 30% in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, to approximately $28 million, and Celsius remained the #1 energy drink brand by dollar share9.\n\nCase volume in the food service channel increased 186% year over year and grew 113% quarter over quarter. Approximately 12% of Celsius' total sales to PepsiCo in the first quarter of 2024 was to the food service channel.\n\nInnovation & Marketing Sales of CELSIUS Essentials continue to exceed expectations and have reached 54.5% ACV and 4.1 average items sold per store10. CELSIUS Essentials were sold in more than 95,000 stores in the first quarter of 202411.\n\nCelsius introduced new, refreshing 12-ounce flavors in the first quarter, including: CELSIUS Blue Razz Lemonade, CELSIUS Raspberry Peach, CELSIUS Astro Vibe, CELSIUS Galaxy Vibe, as well as new variety packs.\n\nCELSIUS On The Go powders reached the #1 position in the energy powder category in the first quarter of 2024 and have increased category share by 1.7 points since January 2024 to 24%12.\n\nCelsius hosted high-profile influencers and celebrities during the first weekend of the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival at the Celsius Cosmic Desert event featuring the Celsius Space Vibe Trilogy (CELSIUS Cosmic Vibe, CELSIUS Astro Vibe, CELSIUS\u00a0Galaxy Vibe) with exclusive performances by artists T-Pain, Two Friends, DJ Xandra and more.\n\nInternational Expansion Sales in Canada began in the first quarter of 2024 and continue to exceed pre-launch expectations. Celsius' share in the energy category in MULOC in Canada was 5.5% as of Feb. 29, 2024, according to Canadian NiQ data.\n\nCelsius in the first quarter announced plans to expand its sales and distribution into Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom in 2024. Sales in the UK and Ireland began in April through the fitness channel and in select gyms. Sales in Australia, France and New Zealand are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year with broadening reach throughout 2025.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nConference Call Management will host a conference call and webcast at 10 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 7, 2024, to discuss the company's first quarter results with the investment community.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nCelsius uses Adjusted EBITDA for operational and financial decision-making and believes these measures are useful in evaluating its performance because they eliminate certain items that management does not consider indicators of Celsius' operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA may also be used by many of Celsius' investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties in evaluating its operational and financial performance across reporting periods. Celsius believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors by allowing an understanding of measures that it uses internally for operational decision-making, budgeting and assessing operating performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or any other financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of Celsius' results as reported under GAAP. Celsius strongly encourages investors to review its financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by Celsius, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. It therefore may not be possible to compare Celsius' use of these non-GAAP financial measures with those used by other companies.\n\n____________________ 1 Circana Total US MULOC L13W Ended 3/31/24, RTD Energy 2 Circana Total US MULOC L4W Ended 4/14/24, RTD Energy 3 Circana Total US MULOC L13W ended 3/31/24, RTD Energy 4 Circana Total US MULOC ended 4/21/24, RTD Energy 5 Circana Total US MULOC L4W ended 4/14/24, RTD Energy 6 Circana Total US MULOC RTD energy weekly sugar free dollar share from 4/11/21 \u2013 3/31/24 7 Circana Total US MULOC L13W ended 3/31/24, RTD Energy 8 Circana Total US MULOC L13W ended 3/31/24, RTD Energy 9 Stackline Total US Energy Drink Category L14W ended 3/30/24 10 Circana Total US MULOC L4W ended 3/24/24, RTD Energy 11 Circana Total US MULOC L4W ended 3/24/24, RTD Energy 12 Circana Total US MULOC L4W ended 3/24/24, Energy Powders 13 Selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Celsius Holdings, Inc. CELH may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\r\n\r\nThat is because Celsius is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CELH in this report.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 22 cents per share for CELH, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CELH, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.45% heading into earnings season.\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Celsius Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. price-eps-surprise | Celsius Holdings Inc. Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\r\n\r\nGiven that CELH has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Celsius, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Celsius (CELH) Reports Earnings Tomorrow: What To Expect\n\nEnergy drink company Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow morning. Here's what investors should know.\n\nCelsius beat analysts' revenue expectations by 4.8% last quarter, reporting revenues of $347.4 million, up 95.2% year on year. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a narrow beat of analysts' gross margin estimates but a miss of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nIs Celsius a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Celsius's revenue to grow 50% year on year to $389.8 million, slowing from the 94.9% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.19 per share. Celsius Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Celsius has only missed Wall Street's revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 10.5% on average.\n\nLooking at Celsius's peers in the beverages and alcohol segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Coca-Cola delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 2.5%, beating analysts' expectations by 2.4%, and Constellation Brands reported revenues up 7.1%, topping estimates by 2%. Coca-Cola's stock price was unchanged after the resultswhile Constellation Brands was down 1%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Coca-Cola's results here and Constellation Brands's results here.\n\nInvestors in the beverages and alcohol segment have had steady hands going into earnings, with share prices flat over the last month. Celsius is down 8.8% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $92.1 (compared to the current share price of $76.45).\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "title": "Hershey (HSY) Q1 Earnings Top, Positive Price Realization Aids",
        "content": "The Hershey Company HSY kickstarted 2024 on a strong note, with the first-quarter top and bottom lines increasing year over year and beating their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales grew across all three segments.\r\n\r\nHershey\u2019s investments in innovation, marketing and in-store execution have been aiding, leading to better consumer engagement and enhanced market share performance across segments. Also, the successful implementation of a new ERP system marked a notable step toward meeting the company's agility and efficiency goals. Management remains committed to its strategies amid the recent business volatility.\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\nHershey posted adjusted earnings of $3.07, which increased 3.7% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.74.\n\nHershey Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nHershey Company (The) price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Hershey Company (The) Quote\n\nConsolidated net sales of $3,252.7 million rose 8.9% from the year-ago quarter, cruising past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,124 million. Organic sales on a constant-currency (cc) basis ascended 8.6% on price realization (up 5.2%). Additionally, volumes advanced 3.4% owing to higher everyday core U.S. confection stemming from greater shipments in expectation of the implementation of the company\u2019s ERP system, which was concluded in the second-quarter beginning.\r\n\r\nThe adjusted gross margin came in at 44.9%, down 170 basis points (bps) year over year due to increased commodity costs, partly made up by price realization and productivity gains. Our model suggested an adjusted gross margin contraction of 250 bps to 44.1%.\r\n\r\nSelling, marketing and administrative expenses rose 6.3% year over year on increased levels of media, capability and technology investments. Advertising and related consumer marketing expenses moved up 12%, with elevated investments across all segments. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased 3.3% due to wage and benefits inflation, capability and technology investments.\r\n\r\nThe adjusted operating profit of $861 million grew 3.7% year over year due to higher sales. However, the adjusted operating profit margin contracted 130 bps to 26.5%. The downside can be attributed to higher investments in brand and capabilities, along with elevated commodity costs, partially compensated by the benefits of price realization and productivity improvements.\n\nSegment Details\n\nThe North America Confectionery segment\u2019s net sales increased 10.4% year over year to $2,707.3 million due to the abovementioned higher shipments. The company\u2019s U.S. candy, mint and gum (CMG) retail takeaway for the 12-week ended Apr 14, 2024 rose 1.1% (in multi-outlet plus convenience store channels or MULO+C). The company\u2019s CMG\u2019s share declined about 10 bps year over year. The North America Confectionery segment\u2019s income advanced 6.8% to $948.2 million.\r\n\r\nThe North America Salty Snacks segment\u2019s net sales rose 1.9% from the year-ago quarter to $275.1 million. Hershey's U.S. salty snack retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ended Mar 31, 2024 in MULO+C declined 4.1% year over year. The segment witnessed a fall in SkinnyPop ready-to-eat popcorn takeaway due to persistent category softness.\u00a0 The segment\u2019s income decreased 17.3% year over year to $38.7 million.\r\n\r\nNet sales in the International segment grew 1.8% year over year to $270.3 million. At cc, organic net sales declined 1.3%.\u00a0 Increased shipments related to the aforementioned ERP implementation, along with increases in Europe and Latin America, were countered by planned decreases in Mexico associated with the dairy beverage product line discontinuation in 2023. The segment\u2019s income was $42.8 million, down by $12.2 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Financials & Guidance\n\nHSY ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $520.4 million, a long-term debt of roughly $3,790 million and a total shareholders\u2019 equity of $4,108.3 million. Management expects capital expenditure of $600-$650 million for 2024 aimed at core confection capacity expansion and constant investments in digital infrastructure.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nManagement expects year-over-year net sales growth of 2-3% for 2024.\u00a0 The company expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be unchanged year over year at $9.59 in 2024.\r\n\r\nManagement anticipates a reported and adjusted effective tax rate of nearly 13% and interest expenses of around $165-$175 million. Additionally, it expects other expenses of $220-$230 million.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 4.4% in the past six months compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 3.7%.\n\n3 Strong Bets\n\nHere, we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Colgate-Palmolive CL, Vital Farms VITL and Celsius Holdings CELH.\r\n\r\nColgate-Palmolive, which manufactures and sells consumer products, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). CL delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.4% in the trailing four quarters, on average. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s current fiscal-year sales and earnings calls for growth of 4% and nearly 9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.\r\n\r\nVital Farms offers a range of produced pasture-raised foods. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. VITL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 155.4%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vital Farms\u2019 current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 19.5% and nearly 30.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.\r\n\r\nCelsius Holdings, which develops, processes, markets, distributes and sells functional energy drinks and liquid supplements, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. CELH has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 67.4%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Celsius Holdings\u2019 current financial-year sales and earnings implies growth of 41.6% each from the year-ago reported numbers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "US Foods (USFD) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",
        "content": "The market expects US Foods (USFD) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 9, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $8.93 billion, up 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for US Foods?\n\nFor US Foods, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.89%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that US Foods will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that US Foods would post earnings of $0.68 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.64, delivering a surprise of -5.88%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nUS Foods doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +53.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $389.6 million, up 49.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Celsius has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 9.45%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Celsius will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Low-Profile Stocks Set to Outperform the Market",
        "content": "The earnings season has helped the stock market move out of a slump. However, with several companies yet to report earnings, we could expect a market rally in the short term. A lot depends on the inflation report and the Fed\u2019s decision, but if you are a long-term investor, you already know that the market always goes through ups and downs. While one cannot time the market, smart investors can pick low-profile stocks that have the potential to outperform the market.\n\nI have picked three stocks that could generate solid returns in the long run. These are well-known companies but not covered by the news or investors as much as they should. The three stocks have the potential to soar higher and generate impressive returns if you have the patience to hold on to them. Let\u2019s take a look at the three low-profile stocks to buy.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have been pounding the table about SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) throughout the last quarter, and the recent financial results have proved that the company is in\u00a0a very strong\u00a0position. SoFi reported a 44% rise in member growth and\u00a0a net income of $88 million. It saw a revenue of $645 million, marking the second quarter of profitability.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, the market wasn\u2019t happy with the second-quarter revenue guidance, which led to a stock dip. SoFi gave a lower-than-expected quarter guidance and called 2024 a \u2018transitional year\u2019 for the business. It aims to rely more on the growth of its financial and tech segment\u00a0than\u00a0lending.\n\nIt added 622,000 new members in the quarter; its total members now stand at 8.1 million. The company has raised the sales outlook for the full year to $2.39 billion to $2.43 billion, up from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion.\n\nDespite beating estimates, the stock slid and is now trading for $6.78. It has dropped 29% year-to-date, and the plunge is a buying opportunity. The long-term prospects of SoFi look attractive, and can potentially double your money.\n\nThe digital bank appeals to the younger demographic, and it has the potential to expand profits in the coming years rapidly. Since it is an online bank, it can lower overhead costs and make the most of the revenue growth. The stock has been on a rough ride for the past few months, so investors need to remain patient.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech company Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is set to report results on May 6. Here\u2019s why you should buy the stock before earnings. Palantir was used for only working for the government, but\u00a0it\u00a0now has a wide umbrella of government and commercial clients. The company has turned profitable and has an enviable clientele.\n\nStory continues\n\nExchanging hands for $21 today, the stock is up 32% year-to-date and had soared 19% after the fourth-quarter results. The upcoming results could lead to another rally. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has led to a surge in revenue and attracted new clients. Its commercial segment revenue grew 70% YOY in the fourth quarter and\u00a0reported a record-high commercial contract value in the fourth quarter of $699 million.\n\nAIP has become a huge hit in the market, and its boot camps have helped convert leads into clients. Indeed, AIP has led to high commercial client growth, where it saw a 35% YOY rise to 497. I expect the same to continue throughout this quarter.\n\nPalantir is slowly becoming a global leader with a strong presence in the thriving AI industry. This low-profile stock could outperform the market in the next two years. It has taken a while for PLTR stock to reach where it is today, and patient investors have already made significant gains.\n\nWe do not expect an immediate upside, but there could be a rally after the results. The stock is Cathie Wood\u2019s favorite for a reason, and the expectations for the upcoming results are high. With momentum on Palantir\u2019s side, investors should be ready for a ride.\n\nCelsius Holding (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a sports beverage company with another low-profile stock up 20% YTD. The company is on a global expansion spree and impressed investors with its fourth-quarter results.\n\nIt saw an impressive 95% YOY surge in revenue for the quarter and a 102% revenue growth for the full year. Additionally, it reported a net income of $39.1 million in the quarter compared to the net loss reported in the same prior year.\n\nThe increasing awareness of health-conscious drinks and the rising demand for healthier sports beverages has\u00a0boosted\u00a0Celsius Holding, and I believe this is only the beginning.\n\nThe company has a presence in the global markets but only holds a\u00a05.9% market share. This means there is ample scope for expansion in the industry. The international revenue was up 52% YOY, and further expansion could accelerate growth.\n\nIt already has plans to expand in Australia and New Zealand. One big reason to own the stock is the changing preferences towards healthy beverages. This trend will continue to dominate the market in the coming years, and Celsius Holding will benefit from it.\n\nTrading at $71 today, the stock is up over 100% in the year. It has gone from $34 last May to $71 today. My\u00a0InvestorPlace colleague Marc Guberti thinks Celsius Holdings can double your money in a year.\u00a0The company is set to report results on May 7.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) ending at $72.34, denoting a +1.5% adjustment from its last day's close. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.34%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.23%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.33%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the company had lost 9.66% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector lost 1.63%, while the S&P 500 lost 4.05%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Celsius Holdings Inc. in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on May 7, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $0.20, marking a 53.85% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $389.6 million, showing a 49.88% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.09 per share and a revenue of $1.87 billion, representing changes of +41.56% and +41.62%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Celsius Holdings Inc. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Celsius Holdings Inc. presently features a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Celsius Holdings Inc. has a Forward P/E ratio of 65.33 right now. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 16.46.\n\nWe can additionally observe that CELH currently boasts a PEG ratio of 2.08. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Food - Miscellaneous was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.04 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Food - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -9.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, which Celsius falls in, has lost 3.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nCelsius is expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +53.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.09 points to a change of +41.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.53 indicates a change of +39.8% from what Celsius is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Celsius.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Celsius, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $389.6 million indicates a year-over-year change of +49.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.87 billion and $2.43 billion estimates indicate +41.6% and +30.3% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCelsius reported revenues of $347.44 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +95.2%. EPS of $0.17 for the same period compares with $0.01 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $326.55 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.4%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCelsius is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Celsius. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the latest stocks Jim Cramer is recommending. If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list, click Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks Heading Into May 2024.\n\nJim Cramer is concluding April by talking about some specific stocks whose performance could give investors insights into the market dynamics today. On Monday, Cramer said during his program on CNBC that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s recent rise is \"instructive of what can make a stock go higher in this dynamic market.\"\n\nElon Musk Bags a \"Terrific Rabbit\"\n\nCramer said he's been saying that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares would keep tanking until and unless \"Elon Musk pull a rabbit out of the hat.\" Cramer said while Musk wasn\u2019t able to find \"that rabbit\" in time for the quarter, he was able to \"bag a terrific one\" on the weekend as the company received in-principle approval from China to deploy its driver-assistance system. The stock jumped about 15% on the news. This development, according to Cramer, could give Elon Musk a \"whole new revenue stream\" and offset the effects of \"vicious\" price cuts in China.\n\nCramer also talked about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s latest deal with Baidu, which he called the \"Google of China.\" The deal, according to media reports, is related to Baidu's mapping and navigation functions, and could clear a hurdle for Tesla to start operating its autonomous driving technology in China.\n\nJim Cramer said that Elon Musk is \"doing something no American CEO can do, just get on a plane and make a deal with the leader of a country\" that our government is not fond of. Because of this, according to Cramer, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders are loving Elon Musk since the stock is up significantly, making a \"fool of last week's downgraders.\"\n\nCramer said that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares can \"keep running\" until its \"shorts are crushed.\"\n\nShould You \"Buy The Fear\" on Apple? Cramer Shares His Thoughts\n\nJim Cramer also talked about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is up after Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi upgraded it, urging investors to \"buy the fear,\" with an $195 price target. Cramer highlighted Sacconaghi's thesis which says that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be entering a \"seasonably strong trading period.\" The analyst also said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s problems in China might be \"cyclical\" and the stock is a buy because of its low valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut does Cramer agree with Toni Sacconaghi? Cramer reiterated that for the past 20 years he's believed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock should be held, not traded. He also said that Toni Sacconaghi is an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"skeptic\" as in February 2018 the analyst downgraded the stock and cut his price target to $170. Adjusting for Apple's stock split, the analyst's projections turned out to be wrong. Cramer said that Toni Sacconaghi is a \"leader\" of the \"contingent\" which has been saying that Apple's \"glory days\" are behind us. Cramer also said he doesn\u2019t care about Toni Sacconaghi's estimates and projections and feels the analyst's bullish call on the stock might \"jinx it.\" However, Jim Cramer yet again recommended investors to buy the stock, albeit after a pullback.\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's bullish on and recommends investors to buy. With each stock we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nJim Cramer said he was \"waiting\" for someone to bring Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) stock up. Cramer is bullish on the company because of its partnership with Nvidia. Cramer said Nvidia talked about Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) \"endlessly\" at the \"great\" GTC conference.\n\n\"I think you have a real winner. The stock went up around the conference and it has come right back down. Recursion is for me.\"\n\nRXRX is a small company which Cramer likes. He is also recommending Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the long term.\n\nDuring its Q4 earnings call, Recursion talked about its partnership with Nvidia:\n\n\"Then in July, a month later, we announced our collaboration with NVIDIA.\n\nThis included a $50 million equity investment. And with our partners at NVIDIA, we\u2019re working on advanced computation, so foundation model development; we\u2019ve got priority access to compute hardware, which I\u2019ll talk about later; and the DGXCloud Resources and we talked with them about the potential for us to put some of our tools into their BioNeMo marketplace. And in fact, just last month in January at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, we released the first third-party tool to exist on NVIDIA\u2019s BioNeMo platform. That was our Phenom-Beta foundation model in January of 2024. So very excited about this ongoing collaboration. One month later in August, we were able to deliver a demonstration of how we leveraged the May acquisition of Cyclica and our brand new partnership with NVIDIA to drive a real value into our platform.\n\nWe were able to predict the protein ligand interactions for more than 36 billion compounds from the N Enamine REAL Space across about 80,000 predicted binding pockets spanning the human proteome. And what this did was generate a large in silico data layer for us, a synthetic data layer.\"\n\nRead the detailed earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 23\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about oil and gas pipeline company Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD). He said that the company has the \"best network\" of fractionators in America. He hit the \"buy, buy, buy\" button on Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD).\n\n\"I can't say enough positive things,\" Cramer said.\n\n8. Caseys General Stores Inc (NASDAQ:CASY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program called food and grocery company Casey\u2019s General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) a \"gem\" and hit the \"buy, buy, buy\" button on the stock.\n\n\"Loved the pizza there.. that is a winner, it should be bought, it's not that expensive given its growth prospects. I wish they'd split the stock.\"\n\nClearBridge Mid Cap Strategy made the following comment about Casey\u2019s General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe Strategy\u2019s consumer staples holdings also fared well. One of our top performers was Casey\u2019s General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY), which operates convenience stores and gas stations. The company continues to drive greater growth and improve internal performance through the expansion of its private label offerings, while a cooling labor market has helped alleviate wage pressures on margins. By deliberately focusing its geographic footprint on smaller communities, the company has high market share in the regions it serves as well as pricing power, which we believe will continue to be long-term earnings drivers.\u201d\n\n7. Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 42\n\nWhen asked about energy drinks company Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH), Jim Cramer said that he's \"liking\" Celsius. Cramer said Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) went down \"because of Monster, but the problems with Monster are really the win for Celsius.\"\n\nJim Cramer was referring the Monster Beverage's declines that came after the stock was hit by two downgrades from notable Wall Street analysts. JPMorgan decreased its rating for the stock to Neutral from Overweight, while Truist Securities downgraded the stock to Sell.\n\nLike CELH, Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe initiated new GardenSM positions in Equifax, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) and Xylem during the quarter. Celsius is an energy drink company viewed as providing a healthier option than its large competitors. We believe Celsius\u2019 product portfolio appeals to a broad demographic, attracting new consumers and more frequent usage occasions in the energy drink category, enabling Celsius to grow sales through market share gains and market expansion. Furthermore, the company signed a US distribution partnership with PepsiCo in October 2022, which is bringing the product into new points of distribution while also improving its penetration across existing points of presence. The end result should be better product availability, increasing brand awareness, higher sales volumes and scale-driven margin improvements.\u201d\n\n6. Coterra Energy Inc (NYSE:CTRA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 42\n\nAnswering a question about oilfield services company Schlumberger, Cramer said that the company \"did not deliver.\" Cramer said he feels \"terrible\" about the stock. However, Cramer reminded investors that he likes Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) and his charitable trust also owns a position in the company.\n\nCoterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) stock has gained about 10% so far this year.\n\nLike Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cramer is also bullish on CTRA.\n\nDiamond Hill Mid Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOther bottom contributors in Q4 included Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA), VF Corporation and Ciena Corporation. Coterra Energy is an oil exploration and production company focused in West Texas\u2019s Permian Basin and Oklahoma. Though production is beating expectations, shares traded in sympathy with the broader industry, which declined alongside falling oil and natural gas prices.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks Heading Into May 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy Jim Cramer\u2019s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Not every promising investment opportunity receives widespread attention. Some hidden-gem stocks are relatively unknown until they soar into the spotlight. Micro-caps become large-caps and lead to generational wealth.\n\nSome of these hidden gems are micro-caps, but setting your sights on this cohort presents significant risk. Some hidden gems end up being duds that drag down your portfolio. However, finding hidden gem stocks with multi-billion dollar market caps is possible. Some of these stocks are relatively unknown despite having enthusiasts surrounding them.

The company also expanded to offer additional subjects like music and math. The Duolingo mobile app has\u00a0over 88 million monthly active users, resulting in stellar revenue growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company reported 45% year-over-year revenue growth and $12.1 million in net income. The switch to GAAP profitability and rising profit margins suggest that the stock can deliver enticing returns for long-term investors. Duolingo reported a $13.9 million net loss in Q4 202,2, demonstrating how far the company has come.\n\nDuolingo has a market cap of just below $10 billion. The stock\u2019s main weakness is its P/E ratio, which sits above 600. Duolingo\u2019s\u00a0133 forward P/E ratio\u00a0is more palatable but still leaves something to be desired. Analysts are mixed and rated it as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d with a\u00a0projected 11% upside.

Fintech Stock Bargains\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ZinetroN\n\nSezzle (NASDAQ:SEZL) only has a $330 million market cap. It\u2019s a riskier pick due to its size and competition in the fintech industry, but its 47 P/E ratio and financial growth offer reasons to feel optimistic.\n\nThe fintech firm is up 176% year-to-date and has comfortably outperformed the stock market.

        "content": "\u201cUndervalued stocks\u201d is a relative term \u2014 for some, it may mean a tech stock in a temporary dip; for others, it means deep value stock analysis involving obscure and esoteric multiples and calculations.\n\nThese companies blend the best of undervalued stock objectives. While some are less-than-profitable and may not be a value stock by most parameters, each has sufficient market strength and imminent tailwinds to propel higher per-share pricing. We\u2019re rapidly entering an era where high-flying tech stocks relying on promises of AI and the like will stop being cash magnets \u2014 look to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Meta\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) price action for proof.\n\nAs an alternative, these stocks will likely start seeing increased investor cash inflows as mega-caps begin drying up and traders fight for diversification from a heavily concentrated market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGarrett Motion (GTX) Two electric vehicles facing a dark sky, sunset background with one EV hooked up to an EV charger in between the two cars. EV Stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Larich\n\nGarrett Motion (NASDAQ:GTX) is a double threat when it comes to undervalued stocks: trading at low multiples (including just 8x earnings and 0.5x sales), the company also exists as an overlooked player in its wider industry: green tech and sustainable driving. The industrial manufacturer makes various automotive parts and add-ons for emission reduction and zero-emission tech, including alternative fuel engines and turbochargers for gasoline and diesel autos.\n\nAs pure-EV plays struggle amid waning consumer interest, as evidenced by skyrocketing hybrid and gasoline vehicle sales compared to electric counterparts, Garrett Motion stock acts as an intermediary for investors interested in long-term sustainability but aware that global EV adoption is a decades-long pipe dream at this point.\n\nRecent stock suppression came from a fair-to-middling earnings report last week that included a 6% quarterly sales slippage, though annual sales stayed steady, and the company\u2019s margins and free cash flow remained healthy. Ultimately, this undervalued stock is a victim of investors looking for the next high-flying growth opportunity. However, as wider economic forces kick the legs from under mega-caps currently controlling the market\u2019s direction, small-cap value stocks like Garrett Motion are expected to become hot commodities.\n\nSturm Ruger & Company (RGR) An LCP Custom handgun manufactured by Sturm Ruger (RGR).\n\nSource: Susan Law Cain / Shutterstock.com\n\nSturm Ruger & Company (NYSE:RGR) is one of those critically undervalued stocks that, with just a hint of good news from its May 7th earnings report, could trigger a buying frenzy that elevates the company well past its current position. That position is a testament to its critically undervalued stock status, a 14.5x price-to-earnings ratio, and an equally slim 1.5x sales ratio. Both may seem reasonable, but when considering the company\u2019s fall from grace after a downbeat November 2023 earnings report it hasn\u2019t yet recovered from, it seems only a matter of time until Ruger reasserts itself on top of the wider firearm stock sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the meantime, income investors can find something to love about Ruger\u2019s stock as management steadfastly sticks to distributing 40% of its net income as dividends; this approach means that quarterly dividend amount may vary but also serves as a smart way for Ruger to ensure shareholder value remains high while keeping enough cash on hand for expansion and initiatives. That payout ratio equates to a respectable 2.32% dividend yield today, which jumps further to 3.78% when accounting for stock buybacks.\n\nCostamare (CMRE) Costamare Inc. website zoomed in on the logo\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven as seafaring shipping concerns put competitor transport stocks at risk, containership chartering company Costamare (NYSE:CMRE) remains robust despite its status among undervalued stocks, trading at just 0.6x book value and 5.6x earnings. Unfortunately, for investors, waiting for Costamare to pop demands patience since, though global freight and charter prices spiked in early 2024, Costamare\u2019s non-operating owner status means that its fleet is more than 87% booked for the remainder of the year and likely at less-than-ideal pricing.\n\nStill, recognizing which way the winds are blowing, Costamare\u2019s management is rapidly right-sizing operations and divesting smaller ships within the fleet while snatching up larger vessels to maximize cost efficiency as geopolitics make naval transport increasingly unpredictable.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest \u2013 Costamare is a strong buy at these levels, but investors should expect upward momentum to take some time to build before the stock sets sail again. In the meantime, Costamare\u2019s healthy 7% total yield (roughly split between buybacks and distributions) should be enough to keep shareholders happy in the short term.\n\nSharkninja (SN) Coins for Undervalued Value Stocks\n\nSource: Via iStock\n\nWide-ranging appliance manufacturer Sharkninja (NYSE:SN) stands out as one of today\u2019s most undervalued stocks in the consumer sector despite receiving little attention from investors. Since its debut in last year\u2019s challenging summer market, Sharkninja stock has proved nearly unbeatable. Its shares soared 130% higher post-listing in less than a year, massively outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Sharkninja\u2019s short-term strength and resilience that make it stand out; the company\u2019s solid operational fundamentals position it for significant growth in the coming years. as evidenced by its 20% annual sales increase since 2008, with no signs of slowing down in the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestors interested in snagging a piece of Sharkninja stock should do so before the company\u2019s May 9th earnings report; muted annual guidance following the company\u2019s fourth-quarter report included fairly flat sales for the first few quarters of 2024 \u2013 so even a modest revenue bump could send shares surging.\n\nVita Coco (COCO) A line of Vita Coco (COCO) waters on a shelf.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeverage stocks like Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) remain at the forefront of the market. Yet, undervalued stock Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO) is quickly becoming a notable contender among big-name beverage stocks. Unlike the highly competitive energy and standard sports drink markets, Vita Coco dominates the coconut water segment, commanding over half the market share.\n\nTo expand its purview, Vita Coco strategically partnered with British alcohol giant Diageo (NYSE:DEO) to venture into the rapidly expanding ready-to-drink alcoholic beverage sector, introducing a line of spiked coconut water options. While coconut water blended with Captain Morgan isn\u2019t my bag personally, analysts forecast that the burgeoning market will hit 7.5% compound annual growth rate targets through 2029, positioning Vita Coco to secure a significant portion of this growth.\n\nFinancially, Vita Coco recently blew expectations away with a year-end earnings beat of 4%, driven by an impressive nearly 500% increase in net income and a profit margin of 9.4%. Investors upset about missing Monster\u2019s stock mega-run may have a chance to redeem themselves with this undervalued stock.\n\nSteelcase (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nHigh-end home office and corporate furniture manufacturer Steelcase (NYSE:SCS) stands out as a promising undervalued value stock, but like others listed, it generally escapes retail traders\u2019 attention. Steelcase has successfully adapted to the evolving work-from-home trends in the post-pandemic era. Its recent $0.10 quarterly dividend announcement translates to a 61% payout ratio and a 2.88% yield.\n\nThe company has swiftly recovered its financial footing after the pandemic\u2019s challenges. Its latest quarterly earnings report showed a net income of $30.8 million, more than doubling the figure from the previous year. Moreover, Steelcase has consistently maintained sales of around $800 million over the past five quarters, indicating effective margin improvements without compromising quality.\n\nIn response to the ongoing shift towards remote work, Steelcase is strategically aiming for 5-7% annual sales growth and a target of 5% free cash flow margin relative to revenue over the next five years. Additionally, the company has significantly reduced its debt to adapt to the higher interest rate environment, thereby enhancing liquidity and minimizing interest expenses. These strategic moves position Steelcase as one of the top undervalued stocks within the lagging remote work stock segment.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) occupies a unique position at the nexus of semiconductor and undervalued stocks, offering an appealing combination in a sector where many options are becoming increasingly expensive. This semiconductor company specializes in developing semiconductor photomasks, a critical but niche area within the semiconductor industry with significant implications for the future.\n\nThe photomasks from Photronics enhance the precision and accuracy necessary for microchip patterning, propelling advancements in cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. These fields demand increasingly complex and precise circuitry, and Photronics\u2019 photomasks likewise contribute to the wider industry\u2019s miniaturization of transistors and components. With its shares trading at a slim 12x price-to-earnings ratio and offering a blend of compelling value propositions, Photronics stands out as a prime candidate among a shrinking pool of undervalued stocks in the semiconductor sector, perfectly positioned at an intersection of current and emerging technologies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Social Finance is an online personal finance company.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) is finally hitting its stride. The stock is down by 26% year-to-date but has reported solid financials that indicate a rebound is due. Q4 2023 net income came in at $48 million compared to a net loss in the same period last year. Revenue grew by 35% year-over-year. Total memberships grew by 44% year-over-year. SoFi now has more than 7.5 million members on its platform.\n\nThe fintech company offers bank accounts, investment accounts, loans, credit cards and other financial products. The company can offer more competitive rates and terms than traditional banks since it doesn\u2019t have as much overhead. Profit margins came in at 8% for the quarter, and SoFi can expand its margins quickly.\n\nSoFi\u2019s leadership has established an encouraging multi-year plan that suggests compound revenue growth of 20% to 25% beyond 2026. The fintech company anticipates 20% to 25% EPS growth beyond 2026. SoFi expects EPS to range from $0.55 to $0.80 per share in 2026, which suggests a reasonable price point for current investors.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is doing everything right from a growth perspective. Revenue increased by 95% year-over-year in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023\u00a0as the company\u2019s sports beverages continued to fly off the shelves. Net income came to $39.1 million for the quarter compared to a $28.2 million net loss in the same period last year.\n\nCelsius Holdings\u2019 efforts to expand globally stand to improve the stock. North America generated $332.8 million of the company\u2019s $347.4 million in total Q4 revenue. The company will\u00a0expand in Australia and New Zealand in Q4 2024. The company\u2019s sports drinks will be available in the United Kingdom and Ireland in Q2 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese developments can keep revenue and earnings growth elevated. The stock will need those two components to keep up with a\u00a062-forward P/E ratio. Celsius Holdings trades at a $16 billion market cap and exhibits impressive revenue and earnings growth. It can double within a few years, if not within the next 12 months.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cosmetics firm has attracted plenty of attention thanks to its 1,100% gain over the past five years.\u00a0Elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is still ahead of the market with a 12% year-to-date gain but is in the middle of a correction. The stock has dropped by roughly 30% from its all-time high as concerns from other beauty brands suggest Elf Beauty may disappoint investors in its earnings report.\n\nHowever, Elf Beauty has a history of outperforming its peers and can repeat that process in its next earnings report. The company\u2019s previous earnings report revealed\u00a0Q3 FY24 results. Revenue surged by 85% year-over-year, which gave the company its 20th consecutive quarter of sales growth. Net income increased by 41% year-over-year.\n\nElf Beauty gained 305 basis points of market share during the quarter. Analysts feel confident about the stock and have rated it as a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d The\u00a0average price target suggests a 31% upside from current levels.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in SOFI, CELH and ELF.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in Celsius (CELH) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH).\n\nCelsius currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy, representing 85.7% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Celsius here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Celsius, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in CELH?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Celsius, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $1.09.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Celsius. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Celsius may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Finding stocks to buy in today\u2019s relatively overvalued and volatile market isn\u2019t as easy as it was when initial rate cuts dropped top stocks to bottom-barrel pricing. While many quickly point to tech stocks as the main wealth drivers in today\u2019s economy, forward-thinking investors know to seek diversification across industries, geographic locations, size, scale, and more.\n\nLikewise, finding long-term stocks to buy demands thorough due diligence to ensure that a company has a strategic vision and actionable plans to achieve its goals. Financial fundamentals and strength are equally clutch today; even the best strategies are futile if the company risks bankruptcy.\n\nEach of these seven stocks to buy offers a unique range of sectors and value propositions while standing on solid financial footing and boasting brighter long-term prospects than much of the market \u2014 making them prime candidates for a buy-and-hold strategy through 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDigi International (DGII)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDigi International (NASDAQ:DGII), an Internet of Things (IoT) tech stock, stands out among stocks to buy on its relatively low profile coupled with remarkable strength. Surprising considering its small-cap status, Digi International just marked its 20th consecutive profitable year, with a 14% CAGR over the past decade and 17% over the past five years. The company manufactures and distributes products essential for industrial-level IoT expansion, including embedded network connections and scalable USB and cellular communication modules.\n\nIoT is swiftly expanding across national markets, with full globalization on the horizon. Currently, there are just over 15 billion IoT-connected devices, a number expected to double by 2030. In response, management projects continued short-term strength, forecasting its annual recurring revenue to double by 2028. Despite a slump in shares this year, Digi is a top choice for investors seeking IoT stocks to buy.\n\nSharkninja (SN) Explore the stock market trends for 2024 with analytical visuals of businessman planning long term investments and future business growth, Navigate towards success with smart strategies. growth stocks with millionaire potential\n\nSource: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWide-ranging appliance manufacturer Sharkninja (NYSE:SN) is one of today\u2019s most robust consumer stocks to buy despite its relative investor inattention. Debuting during last year\u2019s challenging summer market, Sharkninja remained remarkably resilient. Shares climbed 130% higher post-listing in less than a year, outperforming the S&P 500 by a huge margin. However, it\u2019s not just the stock\u2019s short-term strength and resilience that set Sharkninja apart from other stocks to buy; it\u2019s the company\u2019s solid operational fundamentals that position it for significant growth in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nSharkninja employs a simple yet ingenious business model: it provides high-end, semi-luxury appliances like ice cream makers and upscale coffee machines at affordable prices. By targeting consumers who prioritize both budget and quality, Sharkninja satisfies a unique market demand, especially relevant in today\u2019s economy, where consumers seek durable, quality products that align with tighter budgets. Consistently, the company has expanded its sales by 20% annually since 2008, with no signs of slowing down over the next decade.\n\nVita Coco Company (COCO) Creative image of growing coin stacks and candlestick forex chart on blurry background.

Double exposure\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeverage stocks like Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) continue to dominate headlines, but the Vita Coco Company (NASDAQ:COCO) is rapidly gaining ground among beverage stocks to buy. While the energy and standard sports drink markets are highly competitive, Vita Coco dominates the coconut water segment and owns more than half of the total addressable market.\n\nThrough a strategic partnership with British alcohol brand Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), Vita Coco is also making significant inroads into the ready-to-drink alcoholic beverage market by launching a line of spiked coconut water options. Although coconut water mixed with Captain Morgan might not be to everyone\u2019s taste, this emerging market is booming and expected to grow at a 7.5% CAGR through 2029, with Vita Coco well-positioned to capture a large share of this growth.\n\nFinancially, Vita Coco recently exceeded expectations with a 4% earnings beat at year-end, fueled by a nearly 500% increase in net income for the year and a 9.4% profit margin. While everyone knows how Monster became one of the century\u2019s top-performing stocks, Vita Coco might be on track to replicate its success.\n\nFair Isaac Corp (FICO) Button with the word risk pointing between medium and high level, 3D render suitable for risk management or decision-making process situation. represents risk tolerance\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFair Isaac Corp (NYSE:FICO), known for its consumer credit risk measurement system (FICO score), is trading relatively flat in 2024, dipping less than 1% since January 1st despite rising nearly 60% over the past year. As revolving consumer credit reaches record highs and society moves away from cash-based transacting, Fair Isaac is increasingly integral to the evolving digital economy.\n\nFair Isaac is also unique among data analytics stocks to buy, benefiting from AI in the coming years. CEO Will Lansing mentioned in a recent interview that Fair Isaac has leveraged AI and machine learning for the past twenty years, positioning it not as a newcomer but as a pioneer in the field. As technology progresses, the company\u2019s deep expertise in data analytics allows it to explore innovative AI applications and expand its market presence. This capability points to continued strength through 2030, even if its short-term per-share pricing isn\u2019t spectacular.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights.

GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT), while not as widely known, operates similarly but targets the massive B2B market. It also offers small businesses a comprehensive one-stop shop to source products and handle a range of related management tasks.\n\nProduct and inventory management, along with sourcing and payment processing, is tough for smaller businesses when accounting for the many international business nuances. GigaCloud provides a complete solution for scaled B2B eCommerce needs, including an active vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment, and, crucially, safe and secure cross-border payments.\n\nGigaCloud\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio is notably low at just 15x, which is significantly below the tech sector\u2019s average of 33x. This discrepancy becomes even more apparent when considering GigaCloud\u2019s earnings growth. The company has doubled its earnings per share over the past four quarters and maintained strong free cash flow per share, all while trading at a solid discount.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is unique among software industry stocks to buy as it merges AI with automation, focusing on office administration\u2014a sector often overshadowed by more glamorous tech sectors. Better yet, this software stock ranks among Cathie Wood\u2019s top picks, and she particularly likes the stock based on its harnessing corporate data\u2019s latent potential and turning it into actionable insights.\n\nIn a discussion, Wood emphasized UiPath\u2019s software-centric investment strategy, contrasting it with hardware investments, which she views as having more limited upside. She pointed out that software firms can continuously innovate on existing hardware platforms. She also highlighted UiPath\u2019s access to proprietary data across a multitude of global firms, which it uses to automate mundane tasks efficiently.\n\nUiPath recently gained Federal authorization to extend its software solutions to public sectors, a move likely to streamline governmental processes plagued by inefficiency. Securing Federal contracts, known for their lucrative returns, positions UiPath to better diversify and solidify its revenue streams and buffer it against market shocks in coming years.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) stands at the intersection of semiconductor stocks to buy and cheap stocks that are tough to pass up \u2013 a perfect combo, considering so many semiconductor companies are increasingly pricy. The semiconductor stock specializes in developing semiconductor photomasks, a niche semiconductor segment subset with big implications for the future.\n\nPhotronics\u2019 semiconductor photomasks enhance precision and accuracy essential for patterning microchips, advancing next-gen fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing since these sectors require increasingly complex and precise circuitry. Additionally, these photomasks possess fine details that contribute to the miniaturization of transistors and components, operationalizing Moore\u2019s Law to shrink down complex tech. Its combination of value propositions and relative cheapness (trading at just 12x earnings) positions Photronics at the crucial nexus of current and emerging technologies, making Photronics a strong candidate among semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "When the economy goes through a downturn, people must be more careful about spending their money. Budgets get tighter and luxuries get downgraded or skipped altogether. However, some sectors, like consumer stocks, continue to attract capital during any economic cycle.\n\nPeople can\u2019t neglect consumer staples. Consumers need food, beverages, home care products and other essentials in good times and bad times. While stocks in this sector can offer more insulation during economic uncertainty, these same picks can also do well in bullish markets.

The company regularly releases earnings reports that exhibit high growth rates. For instance, Celsius Holdings\u2019 Q4 2023 report revealed a 95% year-over-year increase in sales. Revenue isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s going up. Net income came in at $39.1 million compared to a $28.2 million net loss in the same period last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company has maintained impressive growth rates throughout the year. Full-year 2023 revenue increased by 102% year-over-year while full-year net income flipped from a $198.8 million net loss to a $182.0 million positive net income. The company has a tiny slice of the international market and is expanding in multiple countries. This development should help the company generate robust revenue and long-term net income growth.\n\nThe stock has been a reliable outperformer for long-term investors.

Sprouts Farmers Market also repurchased 5.9 million shares in full-year 2023 for a total investment of $203 million. Investors should anticipate a 5.5% to 7.5% net sales growth in 2024.

That\u2019s the highest increase in over a decade, indicating that Walmart is back to being a dividend growth stock.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent acquisition of Vizio should support higher dividends. Vizio will strengthen Walmart\u2019s growing advertising segment, improving the company\u2019s profit margins in the long run. E-commerce sales are gaining traction and exceeded $100 billion in full-year 2024.

        "content": "Investors interested in stocks from the Food - Miscellaneous sector have probably already heard of Utz Brands (UTZ) and Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nBoth Utz Brands and Celsius Holdings Inc. have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nUTZ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 25.69, while CELH has a forward P/E of 63.11. We also note that UTZ has a PEG ratio of 1.56. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 2.01.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for UTZ is its P/B ratio of 1.77. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CELH has a P/B of 60.40.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to UTZ's Value grade of B and CELH's Value grade of D.\n\nBoth UTZ and CELH are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that UTZ is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Will IBM Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?",
        "content": "Technology powerhouse International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) used to be an industry giant. Big Blue's market cap peaked at $239 billion in the summer of 1999, sparking speculation about perhaps forming the world's first trillion-dollar company.\n\nBut the dot-com bubble popped, and IBM changed gears. The market cap reached $230 billion again in 2012, ending an era where other tech giants were copying IBM's one-stop IT shop business model.\n\nBut that year also marked a sharp strategy shift under newly appointed CEO Ginni Rometty. IBM stiff-armed the hardware side of its operations, apart from the unique mainframe systems segment. When Rometty handed off the reins to current CEO Arvind Krishna in the spring of 2020, IBM was refocused on hybrid cloud computing, data security, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAnd its market cap had dropped to just $106 billion.\n\nThe company has enjoyed another renaissance since then, joining the AI boom just a bit later than many peers. Currently perched at a total market value of $167 billion, is the reformed Big Blue finally destined for trillion-dollar greatness before the end of this decade?\n\nLet's set some realistic targets for IBM\n\nA starting point of $167 billion is pretty impressive. Only 45 of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index's household names can boast a larger market cap than IBM's today.\n\nOne-trillion is still a long way away, though. I'm talking about a sixfold jump, and share prices would rise even faster thanks to IBM's unstoppable habit of buying back shares by the boatload.\n\nSo if IBM has a chance of reaching $1 trillion at all, it won't be a quick and easy romp.\n\nThat's a sixfold gain in five years and change. Most stocks wouldn't even dream of it. And honestly, IBM faces some long odds here. Super Micro Computers(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) have posted the strongest gains on the stock market over the last five years.\n\nSupermicro soared on the wings of unique AI systems; Celsius was a literal penny stock five years ago, and its health-conscious energy drink had no distribution system or marketing to speak of. It's a lot easier to multiply those modest starting values than it is to list IBM from a $167 billion platform.\n\nAnd even then, Celsius barely reached the sixfold market cap multiplication target. Supermicro only made it halfway. CELH Market Cap Chart\n\nWhy I don't mind IBM missing the trillion-dollar mark\n\nSo the trillion-dollar goal looks nearly unreachable from IBM's current starting point, given only five or six years of AI-driven growth. That's alright. I still think IBM is one of the best AI buys in today's market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company can pull its weight with much milder price gains. It doesn't have to meet some arbitrary market-cap goal in five years. Remember, only one stock actually achieved a similar gain over the last five-year period, and that was from an optimal starting point. IBM isn't reinventing energy drinks here or on the verge of signing a global distribution deal with PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP). That's what it took to lift Celsius Holdings' stock sixfold in half a decade.\n\nBut the company is nibbling on explosive growth opportunities in the massive market for business-grade AI services. Its Watson AI engine and the related Watsonx generative AI platform were built for enterprise customers, and the long-term contracts are starting to drop in.\n\nMeanwhile, Big Blue's stock trades at just 22 times earnings and 12 times free cash flows. That's a bargain-basement deal next to AI-driven market darlings like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Supermicro. IBM's stock could triple and still look affordable next to these recent Wall Street rockets.\n\nSo yes, IBM offers a tempting blend of low share prices and exciting growth opportunity in the AI market. You should look away from that hard-to-reach trillion-dollar goal and embrace IBM for what it is -- an undervalued tech titan. You should pick up a few low-priced IBM shares while you can before the market really catches on to the company's valuable position in the enterprise AI industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Celsius Holdings, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CELH) Stock On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Momentum?",
        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Celsius Holdings' (NASDAQ:CELH) stock increased significantly by 32% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on Celsius Holdings'  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Celsius Holdings\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Celsius Holdings is:\n\n21% = US$227m \u00f7 US$1.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.21 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Celsius Holdings' Earnings Growth And 21% ROE\n\nTo start with, Celsius Holdings' ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 19% the company's ROE looks quite decent. As you might expect, the 15% net income decline reported by Celsius Holdings is a bit of a surprise. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.\n\nThat being said, we compared Celsius Holdings' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 7.1% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is CELH worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CELH is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Celsius Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nCelsius Holdings doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we feel that Celsius Holdings certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Crushed the \"Magnificent Seven\" and Turned $10,000 Into $2.8 Million",
        "content": "In the past few years, the investment world has been heavily influenced by the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" enterprises. These industry-leading companies have rewarded investors in remarkable fashion, and they have driven up the returns of the broader market indices.\n\nBut there's one much smaller business whose performance has crushed the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Had you invested $10,000 in this beverage stock 10 years ago, you'd be sitting on nearly $2.8 million right now. This translates to an outstanding gain of almost 28,000%.\n\nLet's dive deeper into this company to better understand its monumental rise before figuring out whether the shares should be in your portfolio right now.\n\nTo the moon\n\nThe business that has produced that type of ridiculous return is Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH), which sells functional energy drink products. The stock's momentum has continued, as it's up 43% this year (as of April 15).\n\nFor shares to rise this much, it's not a surprise that growth has been the single most important factor. Celsius' story is no different. Last year, the company generated revenue of $1.3 billion. That was up from $53 million in 2018, a rise of 2,350%. You would struggle to find businesses that even come close to this type of expansion.\n\nWhat's especially noteworthy is that Celsius couldn't be further from the \"Magnificent Seven\" businesses in terms of disruptive potential or innovation capabilities. But it has benefited from some powerful trends.\n\nFor starters, the energy drink industry is expanding at a solid clip. According to Grand View Research, the market's revenue is growing at more than 8% per year on a global basis. People have shown interest in these types of products, particularly the ones Celsius offers, because they focus on natural ingredients.\n\nIt also helps that people probably drink these beverages multiple times per week, probably as a substitute for regular coffee. This can drive repeat purchase behavior.\n\nTo its credit, Celsius' management team has taken the right steps to broaden the exposure of the brand. This was the top-selling energy drink on Amazon last year, a feat any consumer products business would want to achieve.\n\nCelsius also has a partnership agreement in place with PepsiCo, which handles distribution, both domestically and internationally, for the energy drink enterprise. Celsius can lean on the beverage and snacks giant, plugging into its system, to reach more retail locations and customers. This bodes well for its ability to keep growing sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street is bullish, as analysts are expecting revenue to increase at a more than 34% annualized rate over the next three years. That marks a dramatic slowdown from prior years, but it would still result in a much larger sales base in the future.\n\nOn a larger scale, the global energy drink market generated an estimated $100 billion in revenue last year. Based on its 2023 sales, Celsius is still a tiny fish in a big pond, giving it plenty of room to grow.\n\nThe investing perspective\n\nIt's rational to assume that winning stocks will continue their positive streak in the future. And it's impossible to deny the powerful momentum Celsius is benefiting from.\n\nHowever, I think it's best to set realistic expectations. The stock currently trades at a nosebleed valuation. Shares go for a price-to-earnings ratio of 101, indicating heightened investor exuberance. It doesn't matter how much a business is firing on all cylinders. Valuation always matters. If you overpay, forward returns are likely to disappoint.\n\nEven though the stock keeps rising, I think it's very expensive right now. While I wouldn't bet against the company, I'm not a buyer today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Celsius wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) closed the most recent trading day at $69.97, moving -1.41% from the previous trading session. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.22%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.06%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.52%.\n\nThe company's shares have seen a decrease of 21.73% over the last month, not keeping up with the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 3.79% and the S&P 500's loss of 1.66%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Celsius Holdings Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.20, up 53.85% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $390.22 million, indicating a 50.12% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $1.09 per share and a revenue of $1.87 billion, indicating changes of +41.56% and +41.62%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Celsius Holdings Inc. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.15% higher within the past month. At present, Celsius Holdings Inc. boasts a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nInvestors should also note Celsius Holdings Inc.'s current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 65.06. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.55.\n\nIt is also worth noting that CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 2.07. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

        "title": "Forget Pepsi and Coke: The 3 Best Beverage Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) are the first names that most investors think of when it comes to non-alcoholic beverage stocks.\n\nThe competition between Coke and Pepsi is intense and cutthroat. Pepsi recently announced that it had wrestled the Subway account away from Coca-Cola.\n\n\u201cFor nearly twenty years, The Coca-Cola Company has proudly served Subway restaurants in the U.S,\u201d Coca-Cola told Fortune in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to serving Subway through the end of this year and will remain focused on delivering value for Subway, their Franchisee Partners, and consumers.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition to getting the beverage account from Subway, it already supplies it with Frit0-Lay chips.\n\nYou can invest in KO and PEP stock. However, that comes with the usual shots across each other\u2019s bow in pursuit of market share.\n\nOr, you can invest in a beverage stock and gain new ground in an intensely competitive industry.\n\nHere are three of my favorites other than Coke and Pepsi.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is the largest of the three, with a market capitalization of over $18 billion. It\u2019s also a backdoor way to gain exposure to Pepsi, which owns 8.5% of the energy drink maker. It invested in Celsius as part of its August 2022 U.S. distribution deal.\n\nAt the end of March, Celsius announced expanding its distribution into Australia and New Zealand. On April 4, it announced it was expanding into France through Suntory Beverage & Food France. This follows on its January announcement of its distribution agreement with Suntory for the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nCELH has lost ground in recent weeks due to a change to its Pepsi distribution deal that gives the drinks giant more financial incentives to focus on Celsius products that could affect future margins as a result. However, it\u2019s also possible that the increased focus will add revenue growth, more than offsetting any margin reduction.\n\nI first recommended CELH stock in October 2021. It\u2019s up 166% in the 30 months since.\n\nBellRing Brands (BRBR) A photo of the brands Bell ring (BRBR) logo on a Building\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nBellRing Brands (NYSE:BRBR) is the second-largest of the three, with a market cap of over $7 billion. I recommended its shares in September 2021 as part of a \u201cBrands\u201d portfolio.\n\nBellRing\u2019s major brands include Premier Protein drinks and Dymatize. It was first spun off in October 2019 by Post Holdings (NYSE:POST), with the former parent company selling $500 million in BellRing stock. On March 10, 2022, it distributed the remaining 80.1% of BellRing stock it owned to its shareholders. Post shareholders received 1.267788 BellRing shares for each held in the parent.\n\nStory continues\n\nBellRing\u2019s Q1 2024 results in February included an 18.7% increase in sales and a 27.6% increase in net earnings. During this quarter, Premier Protein and Dymatize had an 18.9% and 20.9% revenue increase, respectively. It got out of the North American PowerBar business over the past year.\n\nIn 2024, it expects revenues of at least $1.87 billion, up from its previous guidance of $1.83 billion, with adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $375 million, $15 million higher than its previous guidance.\n\n13 of 17 analysts rate its stock a buy.\n\nFevertree Drinks (FQVTF) A close-up shot of glass Fevertree Drinks (FQVTY) bottles including soda water, ginger beer, tonic water, and cola.\n\nSource: IZWAN IS / Shutterstock.com\n\nFevertree Drinks (OTCMKTS:FQVTF) is the smallest of the three, with a market cap of $1.6 billion.\n\nI\u2019ve always liked the business because it makes premium carbonated cocktail mixes such as ginger beer and tonic water. However, its stock has not done well in the past five years, down 65% compared to a 75% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nIt is the value play of the three.\n\nIn January, it cut its 2024 revenue outlook from 10% sales growth to 8%. In fiscal 2023, the company forecast annual sales as high as 390 million British pounds ($485.63 million), but ultimately came in at 364 million British pounds ($463 million).\n\nInflation is partially to blame for its retreating shares. Consumers are opting for cheaper cocktail mixes or abstaining altogether to save money.\n\nOn the bright side, it expects its gross margin to improve by 600 basis points in 2024 to 38.1%, 360 basis points higher than fiscal 2022.\n\nIt has a price-to-sales ratio of 3.55, considerably less than its five-year average of 6.10.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "SpartanNash (SPTN) Unveils Acquisition of Metcalfe's Market",
        "content": "In a significant move within the grocery retail sector, SpartanNash Co. SPTN has officially announced its acquisition of Metcalfe's Market, a cherished three-store grocery chain in Wisconsin. This strategic acquisition is set to enhance SpartanNash's presence in the region, increasing its total number of stores in Wisconsin to seven.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1917 by Henry and Teresa Hess, Metcalfe's Market has been a key player in the Wisconsin grocery scene, managed by successive generations of the founding family. The store is known for its commitment to premium quality food, sustainability and a focus on local products, exemplified by initiatives like Metcalfe\u2019s Food Miles program.\r\n\r\nWith the acquisition, the family legacy will continue as the former owners, great-grandsons of the founders, join the SpartanNash team, integrating their family-oriented business ethos with SpartanNash\u2019s broader operations.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition is characterized by a mutual commitment to maintaining core values such as quality and community service. SpartanNash has committed to preserving Metcalfe\u2019s distinctive branding and core shopper experience, thus ensuring continuity for existing customers. Importantly, all current employees of Metcalfe\u2019s Market will retain their jobs and can look forward to enhanced benefits and career opportunities within the expanding SpartanNash network. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEnhancing Customer Experience\n\nCustomers of Metcalfe\u2019s Market can expect the retention of the high-quality products they have grown accustomed to, along with an expanded selection including SpartanNash\u2019s private label offerings, such as the Our Family portfolio of products. Additionally, an enhanced loyalty and rewards program featuring digital coupons and weekly grocery savings will also be introduced to enrich the shopping experience.\r\n\r\nThe co-owner of Metcalfe's Market expressed gratitude for more than a century of community support and shared excitement about joining SpartanNash. They highlighted the shared values between the companies, particularly their commitment to quality and community engagement. They mentioned that joining the SpartanNash family is a thrilling development and emphasized that both SpartanNash and Metcalfe\u2019s uphold a longstanding dedication to quality and community, a tradition maintained over four generations.\r\n\r\nThe transaction is expected to be completed in spring 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, though the specific terms of the deal were not disclosed. This move is anticipated to leverage synergies between Metcalfe\u2019s and SpartanNash, fostering growth and sustainability.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecuring Legacy and Driving Innovation\n\nThis acquisition not only marks a strategic expansion for SpartanNash but also ensures the continuation of Metcalfe's Market's storied legacy, aiming to uphold its foundational principles while steering it toward new horizons under the larger corporate umbrella of SpartanNash. This is seen as a positive step toward reinforcing the commitment to providing exceptional service and products to the communities in Wisconsin, thus furthering a legacy of local engagement and quality that both companies share.\n\nOther Growth Endeavors\n\nSpartanNash has been diligently working on several strategic initiatives and fundamental growth factors aimed at enhancing its operational excellence and community engagement, thereby solidifying its market position and growth trajectory.\r\n\r\nThe company is expanding the use of Simbe's autonomous inventory robot, Tally, to 60 additional stores across the Midwest after a successful pilot in 15 stores. Tally provides real-time inventory insights, helping associates save time and ensuring that products are fresh, stocked and competitively priced. This move is part of SpartanNash's investment in technology to improve the shopping experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the fourth quarter, the company faced challenges in both its wholesale and retail segments. Wholesale net sales dropped 2% year over year to $1.598 billion, mainly due to decreased volume in the national accounts channel. Retail net sales also fell 4.5% to $647 million, with comparable store sales declining 2.8%, largely due to reduced food assistance benefits and lower fuel sales.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have declined 17.2% in the past six months against the industry\u2019s 26.6% growth.\n\nBetter-Ranked Staple Bets\n\nHere, we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely, Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM, Performance Food Group Company PFGC and Celsius Holdings CELH.\r\n\r\nSprouts Farmers Market operates in a highly fragmented grocery store industry. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprouts Farmers Market\u2019s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.7% and 3.9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures. SFM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10%, on average.\r\n\r\nPerformance Food Group Company markets and distributes food and food-related products. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Performance Food Group Company\u2019s current fiscal-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 3.2% and 9.8%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers. PFGC has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.8%, on average.\r\n\r\nCelsius Holdings, which offers functional drinks and liquid supplements, currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. CELH has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 67.4%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Celsius Holdings\u2019 current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 41.6% each from the year-ago reported numbers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this company have returned -17.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.9% change. The Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, to which Celsius belongs, has lost 4.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nCelsius is expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +53.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.09 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +41.6%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.53 indicates a change of +39.8% from what Celsius is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Celsius.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Celsius, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $390.22 million indicates a year-over-year change of +50.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.87 billion and $2.43 billion estimates indicate +41.6% and +30.3% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCelsius reported revenues of $347.44 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +95.2%. EPS of $0.17 for the same period compares with $0.01 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $326.55 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.4%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCelsius is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Celsius. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Will Celsius (CELH) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH), which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 46.88%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Celsius came out with earnings of $0.17 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.16 per share, representing a surprise of 6.25%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.16 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.30 per share, delivering a surprise of 87.50%.\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Celsius. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nCelsius has an Earnings ESP of +5% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company\u2019s international expansion is a key growth driver, with over half of the total energy drink market located outside the U.S. Monster has efficiently managed through inflationary challenges, maintaining solid year-over-year performance.\n\nThat said, many investors may ask: is Monster Beverage stock worth the risk and the investment in this current climate? Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMNST Stock Has Rocketed Higher Over the Past Three Decades\n\nFor 31 consecutive years, Monster\u2019s stock price has surged alongside its sales. Incredibly, over the past two decades, MNST stock has surged over 200,000%. That\u2019s a 2,000X for those counting. Not many stocks can ever provide these kind of returns, and continue showing strong growth year in and year out.\n\nIn 1935, the company started as a family juice business named Hansen\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t until 1990 that the company released its energy drinks, a business that didn\u2019t really thrive until 2002. Through the company\u2019s meticulous and ingenious strategic moves, Monster Beverage was able to dominate the market in a slow but steady. (Really, it was a fast and steady move, something that\u2019s hard to find in today\u2019s market). Overall, most analysts and experts following the stock continue to love the CEOs\u2019 strategies and excellent market predictions.\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has also noticed how fast Monster Beverage gained traction. The world\u2019s largest beverage company decided to invest in Monster in 2015, for a 16.7% stake in the company. What a bet that was, as that stake is now valued at roughly 20% of the company. This collaboration made Coca-Cola Monster\u2019s preferred global distributor and involved swapping ownership of various brands.\n\nMonster Beverage stock gained energy drinks like NOS and Full Throttle, while Coca-Cola acquired Hansen\u2019s Natural Sodas and other brands. This partnership contributed significantly to Monster\u2019s global expansion and stock performance.\n\nThe Bear Case\n\nMonster Beverage defied expectations in the Nasdaq 100 index, experiencing significant growth despite not being a tech firm. Over the past decade, its shares have surged by over 400%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Monster faces challenges as the energy drink market saturates and competition intensifies. Consumer spending tailwinds may also wane, affecting its growth trajectory. Competition is tight, especially from up-and-coming rival Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH).\n\nCelsius poses formidable competition, reminiscent of Monster\u2019s earlier days. Monster\u2019s high price-earnings ratio may not reflect its current growth prospects, but rather the competitive environment the company current faces.\n\nStrategy is Key\n\nDue to its product expansions and brilliant strategic moves, Monster Beverage has seen continued top-line growth which has surpassed its overall industry. Energy drinks were the main driver of the company\u2019s strong performance in 2023, which was the company bring in a 15.1% increase in net sales.\n\nFueled with its product innovations, Monster Beverage is a promising stock. The company continues to launching various drinks globally, like Monster Aussie Lemonade and Ultra Paradise, driving growth. The company also mitigated rising costs through price adjustments globally. In Q4 2023, they increased prices and planned further hikes. Due to these actions, the gross margin expanded.\n\nAll that in consideration, Monster Beverage stock shows promise as an investment with its favorable factors. Over the long-term, this leading energy drink player should continue to dominate this space and grow alongside surging demand.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "The stock market has been ablaze in the past year, fueled by a handful of growth stocks to buy. Over the past year, artificial intelligence (AI) became a key catalyst for the stock market, with growth stocks serving as vehicles to capitalize on this trend. Consequently, the Invesco S&P 500 Pure Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:RPG), which targets the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of growth stocks to buy now within the S&P 500, shot up roughly 18% last year.\n\nHowever, following the robust rallies last year, it is imperative to tread cautiously now to minimize your downside risk. Nevertheless, growth stocks with solid fundamentals and long-term catalysts remain as relevant as ever. Here are three that perfectly fit the description.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy Now: Li Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese EV giant Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) wrapped up another impressive first-quarter (Q1), surpassing its revised guidance to deliver 80,400 vehicles. Also, it surpassed 700,000 cumulative deliveries as of last month, a massive milestone given the slowdown in the EV market. Moreover, in the past month alone, it delivered 28,984 vehicles, representing more than a 39% increase on a year-over-year (YOY) basis.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, LI stock finds itself in the red, with it down more than 15% last month. The correction has plenty to do with the company cutting its Q1 guidance by 24% to 77,000 vehicles. Though a cause for concern, Li Auto\u2019s outperforming its revised guidance points to a stronger-than-anticipated demand for its cars.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s important to note that the company is profitable, a rarity in the EV industry. Wall-Street analysts sense the error in investors\u2019 ways, assigning LI stock a \u2018strong buy\u2019 rating and expecting a healthy 75% upside potential ahead.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nThere\u2019s not much to criticize about sports beverage giant Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) at this point. CELH stock is up over 48% year-to-date (YTD), with its underlying business firing over the past several quarters. It comfortably outperformed analyst estimates across both lines in three of the past four quarters, reporting triple-digit YOY revenue growth in each.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, it generated a whopping $347 million in sales, representing a 95% jump YOY. However, its bottom line was more impressive, which showed a net income of $50.1 billion, shifting from a $21.2 million net loss in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nIt currently generates the bulk of its domestic sales, but its foray into international markets could add new layers to its growth story in the upcoming quarters. It\u2019s currently in the early stage of its expansion into foreign markets, but given its incredible track record, you wouldn\u2019t want to bet against the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock may seem boring, but its investors are happily banking massive gains over the past year or so. The company has positioned itself as a needle-mover in the AI realm, a move that\u2019s served it incredibly well. In the past year, MSFT stock is up over 50%, surpassing broader market gains by more than 20%.\n\nAs we advance, AI will continue to be a major theme for the company. It has effectively layered AI tech throughout its product lineup, yielding substantial benefits for its business. In a recent article, I talked about how the company has exceeded analyst projections by an average of $1.35 billion over the past four quarters. These bombastic results have everything to do with integrating AI into the company DNA, which will continue yielding incredible gains down the road. Meanwhile, its cloud business continues to fire, while new products such as Microsoft Copilot could generate over $25 billion in additional sales by 2025.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "5 Safe Stocks to Buy as Severe Volatility Grips Wall Street",
        "content": "April is generally known as favorable to equity investors. However, this year it is turning out to be different. Month to date, the three major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 have tumbled 4.6%, 2.5% and 1.2%, respectively.\n\nFor the week ended Apr 12, the Dow plunged 2.4%, marking its worst week since March 2023. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.6%, reflecting its worst week since January 2024. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5% during this time.\n\nSticky Inflation Delays Rate Cut Expectations\n\nOn Apr 10, the Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) for March rose 0.4% sequentially and 3.5% year over year. Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) for March rose 0.4% sequentially and 3.8% year over year.\n\nThe U.S. inflation rate remains stubborn despite a restrictive monetary policy and an extremely high interest rate regime in the last 24 months. Fed officials are concerned that even after declining to a great extent from its peak in June 2022, the inflation rate is yet to show any convincing evidence that it is moving gradually to the targeted level of 2%.\n\nThe sticky inflation rate pushed investors\u2019 expectations to June. Following the release of the March CPI data, the CME FedWatch shows just a 17% chance in a rate cut in June. The majority of the respondents are now expecting the first reduction of the benchmark lending rate to happen in September. What is more important is that 9% of respondents are expecting no rate cut in 2024.\n\nBleak Outlook by Major Banks\n\nOn Apr 12, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) reported that their net interest income declined 4%, 4% and 2%, respectively, quarter over quarter in first-quarter 2024. Net interest income is a critical metric for most of the banks, since it measures the difference between what banks earn on their assets and pay out on their deposits.\n\nMoreover, these banking behemoths have warned that this trend is likely to continue in the near term as persistent inflationary pressures and escalation of geopolitical conflicts in the Middle-East are likely to take a toll on their global businesses.\n\nGeopolitical Conflicts and Crude Oil Prices\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Israel is preparing for a direct attack by Iran on southern or northern Israel anytime soon. Earlier, Iran threatened to take revenge on Israel for the Apr 1 airstrike on its embassy in Damascus. This is the biggest escalation in the Middle East conflicts since the Israel-Hamas war started last October.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing the news, crude oil prices spiked. The U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate contract for May delivery touched $87.67 per barrel before settling at $85.66 per barrel, gaining 0.8%. Similarly, the global benchmark Brent\u2019s contract for June delivery touched $92.18 per barrel before settling at $90.45, gaining 0.8%.\n\nnvestors are concerned that higher crude oil prices will result in higher inflation. Higher oil prices will directly affect the transportation sector, which in turn will raise the general price level. This will make the task of the Fed more difficult for a soft landing of the U.S. economy.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five stocks from defensive sectors like consumer staples, health care and utilities to safeguard one\u2019s portfolio. These stocks have strong potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "3 Hot Stocks That Will Thrive Through 2025 (and Beyond?)",
        "content": "Investors are constantly on the outlook for stocks to buy for the long-term and for the reasons to invest into those firms. It\u2019s very simple to identify stocks that are performing well over a recent given period. It\u2019s much more difficult to ascertain whether they will continue to rise or subsequently fall.\n\nMy strong belief is that the stocks to buy for the long-term discussed below will thrive. One reason to believe that will be the case is rate cuts. These firms have performed well even without the benefit of actual rate cuts. Once those cuts are enacted, growth is certain to ensue. Of course, they have many other catalysts investors should consider.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at three stocks to buy for the long-term that have the potential to thrive through 2025.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) has evolved into a well-known AI stock, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. Before diving into AI, the company and its shares were primarily known as an intelligence software platform that was the antithesis of most things Silicon Valley.\n\nThe result was that the company was often maligned as being the tool of warmongers. As time has gone on the company has changed minds. Recent performance of the firm has a lot to do with that. 2023 was the first profitable year for PLTR on a GAAP basis. Profitability in Q4 capped its 5th consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability.\n\nThe company has gained a lot of notoriety for its AI prowess and has multiple products therein. However, I\u2019d also like to note that another reason investors like Palantir is that it is proving its commercial viability. It\u00a0 has long been associated with the defense sector and government spending. However, commercial revenue growth was much stronger than its government counterpart during the most recent quarter. The company is proven that it is more than just another government attache and that should allow it to continue to grow through 2025.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is certainly one of the hottest stocks today. The company is the primary competitor to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the AI chip war.\n\nThe question really boils down to one essential factor. Can AMD\u2019s M1300 chips attract a strong following that meaningfully pulls sales away from Nvidia\u2019s h100 chips? More time will be needed for the answer to emerge. What we know now is that the two chips are comparable based on specifications with AMD\u2019s chips outperforming in some applications. However, Nvidia\u2019s chips cost 3 to 6 times as much.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has been able to maintain those prices and a dominant position overall. I\u2019m not the most technically adept and I\u2019m not a consumer being forced to make a choice between the two. That said, it seems that much of Nvidia\u2019s advantage can be attributed to clever marketing. That suggests that firms could have a shift in perception that would benefit AMD greatly. Thus, I see AMD either surging forward if perceptions change or continuing to play a pursuer role through 2025. Either scenario should benefit share prices.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is an American firm that produces carbonated and non-carbonated energy drinks. The company continues to grow at a rapid pace while also making shrewd moves that should ensure its continued growth.\n\nChief among those moves is a deal for sales and distribution In Great Britain and Ireland. Results from that deal should be visible in second quarter earnings. During Q4 revenues increased by 95%, reaching $$347.4 million. The company also announced further expansion into New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Celsius is intent on much bigger things in the future. The company will continue its global expansion which should further cement its lead in the market. One of the major questions is whether Celsius can continue to grow at such a rapid rate. Sales increase by 102% in 2023. That\u2019s a tough act to follow for any company. However, CEO John Fieldly sees the same health trends that allowed the company to grow in America existing globally.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 unstoppable stocks that will make you richer. To skip the detailed analysis of the economy and market, go directly to the 5 Unstoppable Stocks That Will Make You Richer.\n\nOn April 12, the week closed out with stocks tumbling as the\u00a0 S&P 500 recorded its worst day since January 31, declining 1.46% on the day. On top of that, oil prices are rising significantly as tensions in the Middle East grow. The WTI Crude has risen around $10 since January and is at $85.5 per barrel. The stubbornness of inflation has kept investors and other experts wondering what would happen next.\n\nInterest Rates Amid Current Inflationary Environment\n\nThe latest inflation report showed a higher-than-expected increase of 3.5% which has shaken markets and raised concerns about the possibility of a recession. In an interview with Bloomberg, on April 11, BMO Capital\u2019s strategist, Ian Lyngen, suggests that if inflation continues at these levels, the Federal Reserve may feel compelled to induce a recession in order to meet its 2% inflation target. Manulife Investment Management\u2019s chief economist, Frances Donald also agrees with Ian Lyngen and thinks that inflation is going to \u201csurprise upside\u201d in the near term, causing the Fed to lose the data support to cut interest rates. She said:\n\n\u201cThat increases the probability of a recession and I remember members of my team, back in December said, the Fed is pivoted early, this is gonna provide indirect easing, we should lower our probability of recession calls for 2024. But now that we're back to an environment where we're losing those embedded rate cuts, we actually have to increase the chance of something bad happening here.\"\n\nBlackRock, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) CEO, Larry Fink told CNBC on April 12, that he still expects two rate cuts this year but the Fed isn\u2019t likely to meet the 2% inflation target. We previously mentioned the comments from BlackRock, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:BLK) Managing Director, Tony DeSpirito, that he keeps a bullish view of the current year and the years ahead. For more information on that, go to 12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks that Made People Rich in 2023\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the forerunner among the stocks that have made investors rich in 2023, as the company surged nearly 240% last year and is continuing its upward run with year-to-date gains of over 83% on April 12. The stock isn\u2019t on our current list as analyst price targets do not show enough upside for the stock. However, the company still has massive future growth potential despite new competitors rising to take away a bit of AI accelerator market share from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nNevertheless, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya still believes in the stock\u2019s upside potential and says that the company\u2019s commanding presence in business sales not only shields its market share but also positions it strategically to potentially increase its market share. On April 10, the analyst reiterated a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock with a $1,100 price target, up from $925.\n\nDuring the tech industry surge of 2023, there were a few multi-baggers that remained in the dark with all the news surrounding the AI revolution. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) was one such company that returned massively when everyone was busy looking at the Magnificent 7. It is a Connecticut-based company that handles less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping across North America. While the broader industrial sector significantly underperformed the market in 2023, XPO, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:XPO) share price gained over 163%. Additionally, the company's stock is up 48.2% year-to-date on April 12 compared to the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLI) 23% gain over the same period. On top of that, the company isn\u2019t looking to slow down in the next few years. Its CEO, Mario Harik made the following comments at the company\u2019s latest earnings call:\n\n\u201cFor 2024, we expect our LTL capex level to be in the low-teens as a percent of revenue, and again, primarily allocated to our fleet. In terms of the 28 service centers, we acquired from Yellow, the largest impact on our capital strategy is timing. We've put forward dozens of real estate investments that we plan to make over the next several years. I'll add some strategic color to my earlier comments on the acquisition.\n\nThese service centers will deliver important benefits to the business for years to come. First, they'll get us closer to customers, and give us larger facilities in major metro areas. This should drive substantial cost efficiencies across our line haul, pickup-and-delivery and dock operations. Second, they'll enhance our yield growth by further improving, our service with fewer freight three handles, reduce damages, and better on-time performance.\n\nAnd third, that'll give us more capacity in key metros like Indianapolis, Columbus and Las Vegas. These are markets where we are currently turning away profitable customers, because we don't have enough door capacity. We plan to start bringing these locations online in April and have all of them operational within the next 12 months to 18 months. We expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS and our LTL operating ratio in 2025.\u201d\n\nNow let us move on to unstoppable stocks of the current year that can potentially make you richer. The list includes Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), and CRH plc (NYSE:CRH). 10 Unstoppable Stocks That Will Make You Richer\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 20 large to mega-cap stocks that have experienced a share price gain of at least 20% year-to-date as of April 11, and have an average analyst price target upside of at least 10%. We narrowed down our list to 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upsides and listed them in ascending order of upside potential, primarily, and year-to-date gains, secondarily. Analyst ratings and price targets were taken from TipRanks.\n\nWe also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Unstoppable Stocks That Will Make You Richer\n\n10. Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:CRWD), and CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) also made it to our list of unstoppable stocks that will make you richer, along with Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSemiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.\u201d\n\n9. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 14.48%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 30.49%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 129\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers ride-hailing services and operates through three segments, Mobility, Delivery, and Freight. For the quarter ended on December 31, 2023, the company recorded 28 million trips per day and 150 million monthly active platform consumers. The company is 30.49% higher year-to-date, as of April 11.\n\nOver the last three months, 36 Wall Street analysts have given their recommendations on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), with 34 analysts rating the stock a Buy. As of April 11, the stock\u2019s average price target of $87.19 represents an upside of 14.48% to its current price.\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) was part of 129 funds\u2019 portfolios and the total stake amounted to $8.74 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. D E Shaw has increased its stake in the company by 30% to 14.39 million shares worth $886.123 million and is the most significant shareholder, as of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nRiverPark Advisors stated the following regarding Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 3Q23 earnings and 4Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $35.3 billion were up 21% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17.9 billion grew 30% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 16% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, up $576 million year over year, was better than management\u2019s guidance of $1 billion, and the company generated $900 million of free cash flow, up from $358 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 4Q Gross Bookings (23.5% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.2 billion).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates.1 Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5.1 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $128 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year\u2019s free cash flow.\u201d\n\n8. Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 14.78%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 23.82%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39\n\nCorebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG), previously known as SAFG Retirement Services, Inc., offers retirement solutions, and insurance products in the U.S. The company operates through Individual Retirement, Group Retirement, Life Insurance, and Institutional Markets businesses.\n\nCorebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG) has gained 23.82% year-to-date, as of April 11. Hedge fund sentiment was positive toward the stock in Q4 of 2023 as hedge funds with investments in the stock were 39, with positions worth $841.095 million. This is compared to 23 funds with positions worth $266.028 million in the previous quarter. The company takes the 8th spot on our list of unstoppable stocks that will make you richer.\n\nCorebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG) has a consensus rating of Strong Buy as per the 9 Wall Street analysts that have covered it over the last three months. The average price target of $31.22 implies an upside of 14.78% from the present levels, as of April 11.\n\nArtisan Partners made the following comment about Corebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCorebridge Financial, Inc. (NYSE:CRBG), a provider of life insurance and retirement solutions, was a standout in the financials sector. Corebridge was previously a unit of AIG and a September 2022 IPO. Earnings and cash flow have been solid, aided by increased spread income in the general account due to higher reinvestment rates. We added Corebridge to the portfolio in Q1 2023. Our thesis is now that Corebridge is not a part of a large inefficient and capital-constrained parent, the company should have plenty of room to improve its competitive position. Establishing new processes that both improve capabilities and wring out efficiencies as a standalone entity should help improve ROE in coming years. It has a 4%+ dividend yield and a double-digit free cash flow yield, even in 2022 when negative fixed income and equity markets reduced fee revenue. In addition to the dividend, free cash flow will be used to ensure holding company liquidity, repurchase stock and support modest growth expectations.\u201d\n\n7. Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 15.12%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 37%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nCelsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) is a developer and seller of functional energy drinks and liquid supplements. The company sells its products under multiple brands, including CELSIUS, CELSIUS ESSENTIALS, FAST Brands, etc. The stock is up by 37% year-to-date, as of April 11.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, 42 hedge funds had stakes in Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH), with total positions worth $518.873 million. With 2.6 million shares worth $142.671 million, Marshall Wace LLP is the most prominent shareholder in the company as of December 31, 2023.\n\nBased on 9 Wall Street analysts\u2019 ratings over the past three months, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) has a consensus rating of Strong Buy. The average price target of $93.10 implies an upside of 15.123% from the last price of $80.87, as of April 11.\n\nArtisan Partners stated the following regarding Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe initiated new GardenSM positions in Equifax, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) and Xylem during the quarter. Celsius is an energy drink company viewed as providing a healthier option than its large competitors. We believe Celsius\u2019 product portfolio appeals to a broad demographic, attracting new consumers and more frequent usage occasions in the energy drink category, enabling Celsius to grow sales through market share gains and market expansion. Furthermore, the company signed a US distribution partnership with PepsiCo in October 2022, which is bringing the product into new points of distribution while also improving its penetration across existing points of presence. The end result should be better product availability, increasing brand awareness, higher sales volumes and scale-driven margin improvements.\u201d\n\n6. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)\n\nPrice Target Upside: 15.34%\n\nYear-to-date Gain as of April 11: 44.84%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 51\n\nSea Limited (NYSE:SE) is involved in digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial service businesses, through Garena, Shopee, and SeaMoney, respectively. The company takes up the 6th spot on our list of unstoppable stocks that will make you richer.\n\nAs of April 11, Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is up by 44.84% year-to-date. In the last three months, 18 Wall Street analysts covered the stock, and 13 kept a Buy rating on the stock. The average price target of $64.38 represents an upside of 15.34% from the last price of $55.82, as of April 11.\n\nSea Limited (NYSE:SE) was part of 51 funds\u2019 portfolios and the total stake value was $2.173 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. As of Q4 of 2023, Tiger Global Management LLC is the top shareholder in the company and has a position worth $579.966 million.\n\nSea Limited (NYSE:SE) is one of the unstoppable stocks that will make you richer, in addition to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), and CRH plc (NYSE:CRH).\n\nLakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the largest detractor was Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) (-17.1%), which sold off following the release of its quarterly results where earnings came in below expectations. For our part, while a headline drop in profitability can appear worrying, we aren\u2019t overly concerned as it was merely a function of management\u2019s intentional decision to increase investment towards e-commerce to drive growth. As the broader Southeast Asian e-commerce market recovers from some post pandemic headwinds and their primary competitor TikTok is entangled in a regulatory setback in Indonesia, we agree with management that now is the time to be aggressive and pivot back to growth mode and consolidate market share.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Unstoppable Stocks That Will Make You Richer.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy Now 11 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In 20 Biggest Iron Ore Mining Companies in Australia, 2024\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "It\u2019s not every day when an investor gets to double their investment. Some stocks offer the potential to do more than that. Buying growth stocks at the right time and holding on to your investments can result in a 4x return.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s hard to find growth stocks with that type of potential. Not every investor needs those returns to achieve long-term financial goals. Focusing on side hustles, getting a raise and exploring new career opportunities will give you more money to invest in your monthly portfolio. However, a 4x return certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt if you could get it.\n\nThese growth stocks offer great potential and can turn $250,000 into $1 million.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) boasts impressive financial growth and double-digit profit margins. The company\u2019s sports beverages are a big hit in North America and are expanding internationally. Most of the company\u2019s sales are domestic, while international sales remain relatively untapped.\n\nCelsius generated $1.3 billion in revenue during\u00a0the full year of 2023. That\u2019s a 102% year-over-year increase compared to 2022. Revenue jumped by 95% year-over-year in Q4 2023, while net income reached $39.1 million. The company reported a net loss of $28.2 million in the same period last year.\n\nThe sports beverage company\u2019s stock has already turned $250,000 into $1 million for some investors. Shares are up by more than 5,900% over the past five years and are off to a strong start. CELH stock is up by 43% year-to-date. The stock is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 11 analysts with a projected 10% upside. The highest price target of $110 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 29%.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc.

The stock has many supporters on Wall Street and is currently rated as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The average price target suggests a 12% upside, while the highest price target of $675 per share indicates a 20% gain is in the cards.\n\nThe chipmaker has steadily outperformed the stock market. The stock is up by 48% over the past year and has gained 375% over the past five years. Synopsys has an $86 billion market cap and a 62 P/E ratio.

The company\u2019s pending acquisition of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) can help it gain market share faster.

The stock\u2019s 61% rally over the past year highlights that shares aren\u2019t cheap. Duolingo currently has a 133-forward P/E ratio. Bullish investors are optimistic that rising profit margins will result in a more favorable forward P/E ratio in future quarters. However, it is a lofty valuation.\n\nThe educational app helps people learn new languages and has recently expanded into additional subjects like math and music. Duolingo has reported excellent financial growth and continues to attract new users.\n\nDuolingo\u2019s daily active users and monthly active users increased by 65% and 46% year-over-year, respectively. Those growth rates helped Duolingo deliver 45% year-over-year revenue growth. Net income reached $12.1 million in\u00a0Q4 2023,\u00a0a notable improvement from the $13.9 million net loss reported in Q4 2022.

        "title": "12 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Invest in",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best counter cyclical stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our introduction of what counter cyclical stocks are and how they behave with respect to the economy and other macroeconomic indicators, then you can skip ahead to take a look at the 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Invest in.\n\nWhen we talk about dividing stocks based on their share price behavior in response to economic events and news, the two widely used categories are consumer cyclical and consumer defensive. As their titles suggest, consumer cyclical stocks are those that follow economic cycles. The latter, on the other hand, are also called counter cyclical stocks, and they are considered as a buffer against the broader stock market downturns that often take place if investors believe that the economy is in trouble.\n\nThis bifurcation of the stock market between cyclical and counter cyclical stocks is based on their underlying business models. Cyclical socks are typically present in high growth industries such as consumer technology, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology. This means that their business models and markets are dependent on factors such as consumer purchasing power, inflation, and interest rates. These three major economic indicators fluctuate with the economy, and when economic performance is robust and authorities are taking a proactive approach to managing monetary policy, then purchasing power is stable and inflation and interest rates are typically low.\n\nOn the flip side, in the case of poor economic performance, both businesses and consumers find it difficult to splurge on luxury items or pricey items such as artificial intelligence processors from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). These processors are believed to cost as much as a whopping $2 million a piece. Consequently, if a business is struggling during an economic downturn or capital is hard to raise due to high interest rates, then companies might be unwilling to buy these chips. As a result, NVIDIA becomes a cyclical stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile NVIDIA's consumer or enterprise products are typically considered a luxury, after all, few people need a GPU to just live, stocks such as the mega retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are counter cyclical stocks. To be clear, counter cyclical does not imply that if there is say a recession in America then Walmart's shares will rise. Instead, it means that in such a scenario, the stock will tend to lose a smaller portion of its value when compared to the high growth cyclical stocks that we've identified above.\n\nSo why do counter cyclical stocks tend to hold their ground when everybody else is running for cover? Well, the answer is relatively simple, and while Walmart is a good example for illustration, we've got an even better example of a counter cyclical stock to pickle your brain. This stock belongs to none other than one of the biggest tobacco companies in the world, the Stamford, Connecticut based counter cyclical giant Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM). Phillip Morris sells cigarettes, a highly addictive combination of nicotine and the first type of anti depressants developed called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).\n\nThis makes cigarette smokers vulnerable to an unending cycle of low dopamine and no dopamine, meaning that they simply have to buy and smoke the tobacco sticks no matter what state the economy is in. Consequently, the demand for cigarettes is unelastic not only to price but also to the smoker's economic condition, and investors, aware of this, pile into these stocks to protect their money in a weak economic environment.\n\nYet, just because counter cyclical stocks are portfolio buffers in a troubled economy doesn't mean they can't perform well when the economy is kicking. In fact, one counter cyclical stock that has held its ground this year has been Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) whose shares are up 42% year to date. Here's what Artisan Partners had to say about the stock in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nCelsius is an energy drink company viewed as providing a healthier option than its large competitors. We believe Celsius' product portfolio appeals to a broad demographic, attracting new consumers and more frequent usage occasions in the energy drink category, enabling Celsius to grow sales through market share gains and market expansion. Furthermore, the company signed a US distribution partnership with PepsiCo in October 2022, which is bringing the product into new points of distribution while also improving its penetration across existing points of presence. The end result should be better product availability, increasing brand awareness, higher sales volumes and scale-driven margin improvements.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at hedge funds' favored counter cyclical, or consumer defensive stock picks. A handful of notable names are The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM). 12 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Invest in\n\nNiloo / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best counter cyclical stocks, we ranked the forty most valuable counter cyclical stocks in terms of their market capitalization by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares during Q4 2023.\n\nFor these top counter cyclical stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Always reviewing investment ideas allows you to capitalize on great deals when they arrive.\n\nInvestors can choose from thousands of publicly traded corporations. However, you may want to consider buying at least one of these seven top stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has entered a sharp correction ever since its competitor Ulta Beauty (NYSE:ULTA) warned investors about a slower beauty market. The recent pullback has resulted in a 46-forward P/E ratio for the cosmetics company.\n\nWhile some investors may feel nervous about the valuation, the reaction to Ulta news is overdone. The two beauty companies are in different leagues when it comes to growth rates. Ulta\u2019s revenue growth hovers at around 10% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Elf Beauty reported an 85% year-over-year increase in net sales and gained 305 basis points of market share in\u00a0Q3 FY24.\n\nElf Beauty has been maintaining 80% year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters while delivering impressive net income growth as well. The company also raised its fiscal 2024 outlook and achieved its 20th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nAnalysts have rated the stock as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d with a projected 30% upside. The stock has already been up by 92% over the past year. The correction presents a long-term buying opportunity, and it\u2019s possible for Elf Beauty to gain market share while others in the industry report slower sales. The second stock on this list follows that trend.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) An image of a hacker on a laptop with icons of messages and data behind him\n\nSource: jossnat / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that continues to grow at a solid rate while competitors are slamming the brakes and announcing lukewarm guidance. Crowdstrike previously declined in solidarity with other cybersecurity stocks as they reported unfavorable guidance. Investors had a change of heart after Crowdstrike reported a strong earnings report for Q4 FY24.\n\nRevenue grew by 33% year-over-year to reach $845.3 million. The company also has $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue which serves as a good baseline. It\u2019s getting easier for hackers to threaten companies. They can use artificial intelligence to brute force their way into unprotected databases. These tools are getting more advanced, and the Crowdstrike Falcon Platform offers good protection from cyberattacks. This makes it one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike has always delivered impressive revenue growth, but the company\u2019s rising profit margins are also stirring up excitement. The company reported $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year. The stock has gained 392% over the past five years.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Writing note showing Content Marketing. Business photo showcasing involves creation and sharing of online material.\n\nSource: Artur Szczybylo via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is a search engine marketing tool that helps businesses identify promising keywords. The first page of Google is prime real estate for online and local businesses. Those placements result in more website visitors who can turn into leads.\n\nCompetition in the industry is fierce, and Semrush gives many business owners the resources they need to succeed. Semrush is more than just keyword research. You can conduct detailed competitor analyses and discover opportunities to grow your business.\n\nThe stock has been bumpy since its IPO but is getting into the swing with a 31% gain over the past year. The company recently became profitable and reported an 8.5% net profit margin in\u00a0Q4 2023. That quarter also featured a 21% year-over-year revenue increase. Full-year net income came in at $1.0 million while the company generated $6.9 million in Q4 2023 net income.\n\nSemrush has approximately 108,000 paying customers which is a 12.5% year-over-year improvement. This broad customer pool can insulate the business from sharp revenue declines. Furthermore, some of the company\u2019s paying customers may upgrade their plans to access additional features.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a group of people eating fast food, including cheeseburgers and fries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is gaining market share in the fast food industry and continues to generate double-digit growth rates for its top and bottom lines. The fourth quarter of 2023 featured 15.4% year-over-year revenue growth and 26.1% year-over-year net income growth. Chipotle\u2019s net profit margin increased to 11.2%.\n\nThe company opened 121 restaurants in Q4 2023 and 271 new restaurants in the full year. Most of these restaurants include Chipotlanes, which allows the company to serve more customers. Chipotle has plans to open 285-315 restaurants in 2024 which is a 10.7% year-over-year improvement at the midpoint.\n\nChipotle stock will go through a\u00a050-for-1 stock split in June. The stock split will make shares more accessible and increase options trading volume. The stock has done a fine job of outperforming the stock market before its upcoming split. Shares are up by 308% over the past five years. It\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to win support from Wall Street analysts. Cloud computing, online marketplace sales, advertising, and video streaming are some of the catalysts that are prompting higher price targets.\n\nThe stock currently has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating and an average price target that suggests a 13% upside. Amazon only has Buy ratings from its 41 analysts. The highest price target of $230 per share suggests that the stock can rally by an additional 24%.\n\nAmazon is growing in multiple industries and recently reported its highest-ever revenue. Net sales increased by 14% year-over-year to reach $170 billion in\u00a0Q4 2023. North American and international sales accelerated in the fourth quarter, while Amazon Web Services revenue growth stayed in line for Q4 2023 compared to full-year 2023. All in all, it\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nThe segment had a 13% year-over-year growth rate for both time periods. Advertising services did even better with 27% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has outperformed the stock market with a 146% gain over the past year. Shares are also off to a hot start with a 52% year-to-date gain and come with a 34 P/E ratio.\n\nThe company\u2019s commitment to expanding profit margins can result in a more enticing valuation in the future. Meta Platforms more than tripled its net income in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue was 25% higher in the quarter compared to the same time last year.\n\nMeta Platforms don\u2019t only have good growth rates. It also has a healthy balance sheet. The social media firm has $65.40 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. On the other hand, it only has $18.39 billion in long-term debt. Meta Platforms reduced its headcount by 22% year-over-year to facilitate its profit margin expansion.\n\nMETA stock has now become a dividend growth play as the company recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The company will probably maintain an annualized growth rate above 10% for many years.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthy sports beverages that does not have ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, sugar, or gluten. The drink also contains essential vitamins and plenty of caffeine.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the stock and have rated it as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The stock has a projected 11% upside at the average price target. The highest price target of $110 per share implies that shares can rally by an additional 31% from current levels.\n\nThe company is growing at a fast rate and is gaining market share from its competitors. Celsius Holdings reported 95% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0Q4 2023. The sports beverage company generated $322.8 million of its $347.4 million in North America. International revenue grew by 68% year-over-year and is still in its early innings.\n\nThe company is on the verge of tapping into Australian and New Zealand markets. The beverages will reach the continent in\u00a0Q4 2024. Domestic sales remain elevated, and international traction can lead to high revenue growth for several years. The company has maintained double-digit profit margins while generating substantial top-line growth rates. All in all, it\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF, AMZN, and CELH.

Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the explosion of alcoholic craft beer drinks or the steady decline of non-alcoholic sugary sodas. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.\n\nThe 14 beverages and alcohol stocks we track reported a weaker Q4; on average, revenues were in line with analyst consensus estimates. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 20.2% below consensus. Stocks have been under pressure as inflation (despite slowing) makes their long-dated profits less valuable, but beverages and alcohol stocks held their ground better than others, with share prices down 2.7% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nBest Q4: Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO)\n\nFounded in 2004 followed by a 2021 IPO, The Vita Coco Company (NASDAQ:COCO) offers coconut water products that are a natural way to quench thirst.\n\nVita Coco reported revenues of $106.1 million, up 15.4% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 7%. It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings and revenue estimates. On the other hand, its full-year revenue guidance was underwhelming. However, adjusted EBITDA guidance came in ahead, which is sure to blunt the impact of the below-Consensus revenue guidance.\n\nMartin Roper, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, said, \u201cWe are extremely pleased with this year's results with 15% net sales growth, Net Income of $47 million, and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $68 million, which were all at the high end of our expectations. The coconut water category is healthy and our team continues to deliver strong results across our major markets as we gain branded share and benefit from our private label coconut water supply relationships. We expect our full year 2024 net sales to be between $495 and $505 million, driven by healthy coconut water volume growth, offset by the loss of some of our private label coconut oil business. While the macro environment remains very dynamic, we expect 2024 Adjusted EBITDA2 to be between $74 and $78 million. We remain focused on driving long term growth of the coconut water category and our brands.\u201d\n\nStory continues Vita Coco Total Revenue\n\nVita Coco pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat and highest full-year guidance raise of the whole group.

        "content": "The Consumer Staples group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. BRF (BRFS) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Consumer Staples peers, we might be able to answer that question.\n\nBRF is a member of our Consumer Staples group, which includes 191 different companies and currently sits at #13 in the Zacks Sector Rank.

The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proven model that highlights a variety of stocks with the right characteristics to outperform the market over the next one to three months. The system emphasizes earnings estimate revisions and favors companies with improving earnings outlooks. BRF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BRFS' full-year earnings has moved 62.5% higher within the past quarter.

        "title": "Is Celsius (CELH) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH).\n\nCelsius currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy, representing 85.7% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Celsius here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Celsius, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in CELH?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Celsius, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $1.09.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Celsius. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Celsius may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "It\u2019s less stressful to buy reliable companies and hold onto them for many years than it is to trade stocks and strategically plan your entries and exits. Even the most reliable companies go through down cycles and you will have to remain patient during those stretches. This reality has led to the 3 best long-term stocks to buy in April 2024.\n\nWhile every stock goes through ups and downs, reliable long-term growth stocks continue to gain instead of puttering out after a big rally. Long-term stocks exhibit competitive moats and expand their profit margins. These corporations have multiple years of sustainable growth and catalysts that still look strong.\n\nInvestors looking for some long-term stock ideas may want to consider the 3 best long-term stocks to buy in April 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) Graphic of green and blue arrow against pale green background pointing up and to the right, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ex_artist\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a sports beverage company that offers healthier alternatives than many of its competitors.

Investors have noticed and have bid up the stock by 5,500% over the past five years. The stock has double-digit net profit margins and has a compelling growth opportunity that can result in more gains.\n\nCelsius Holdings is expanding internationally. Almost all of its sales currently come from North America. It\u2019s still in the very early innings of its international expansion and\u00a0recently got into Australia and New Zealand. The company will launch its beverages in those regions in Q4 2024.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

The Magnificent Seven stock is expanding its net profit margins and currently comes with a $1.9 trillion market cap. The stock is up by 76% over the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech conglomerate once again posted strong financials. Revenue increased by 14% year-over-year to reach a record-breaking $170.0 billion. The online marketplace achieved double-digit growth rates in domestic and international markets. Amazon Web Services grew by 13% year-over-year.

The app recently began to offer educational resources for math, music, and additional subjects that stretch beyond learning new languages.\n\nThe green bird has been producing positive returns for investors. Shares are up by 49% over the past year. The stock\u2019s only weakness is its\u00a0130-forward P/E ratio. The most compelling growth stocks often have high valuations, but investors have a few reasons to believe that Duolingo can grow into its valuation.\n\nRevenue increased by 45% year-over-year in\u00a0Q4 2023 amid a 65% year-over-year increase in the number of daily active users. The company\u2019s $12.1 million in net income was a big development as the firm had recently been unprofitable.\n\nDuolingo\u2019s scaling efforts can translate into profit margin expansions that will make the stock look more attractive for long-term investors. The firm has the potential to be a great long-term stock and will look more enticing after a pullback.

        "title": "Estimating The Fair Value Of Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nCelsius Holdings' estimated fair value is US$73.72 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Celsius Holdings' US$82.92 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Analyst price target for CELH is US$92.92, which is 26% above our fair value estimate\n\nDoes the March share price for Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Celsius Holdings\n\nIs Celsius Holdings Fairly Valued?\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$175.9m US$290.7m US$374.7m US$457.0m US$562.0m US$640.3m US$707.1m US$763.7m US$811.6m US$852.9m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x7 Analyst x6 Analyst x4 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 13.93% Est @ 10.44% Est @ 7.99% Est @ 6.28% Est @ 5.09% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.0%  US$166 US$259 US$315 US$362 US$421 US$452 US$471 US$480 US$482 US$478\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.9b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.0%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$853m\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (6.0%\u2013 2.3%) = US$24b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$24b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.0%)10= US$13b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$17b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$82.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Celsius Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Celsius Holdings\n\nStrength\n\nCurrently debt free.\n\nWeakness\n\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nThreat\n\nNo apparent threats visible for CELH.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "title": "This Magnificent Growth Stock Has Skyrocketed Nearly 6,000% in the Past 5 Years: Here's Why I'm Not Buying It.",
        "content": "If you're someone who likes to pick individual stocks, your hope -- no doubt -- is for those companies to outperform a broad index. That's a difficult task with the Nasdaq Compositeup 124%, including dividends, since March 2019.\n\nHowever, some businesses have been able to absolutely trounce the index. Look no further than Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH) as proof. The purveyor of functional energy drinks has seen its shares skyrocket 5,870% in just the last five years. This means a $1,000 investment back then would be worth almost $60,000 today.\n\nThis beverage stock continues to soar in 2024, benefiting from tremendous momentum. But I'm still not buying it. Here's why.\n\nLofty expectations\n\nIt's probably not surprising to know that because of Celsius' huge price gain, the stock isn't cheap. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 119. That's not a bargain by any stretch of the imagination. For comparison's sake, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index sells at a P/E multiple of 31 right now.\n\nDespite its growth potential, which I'll discuss below, Celsius shares are trading at a nosebleed valuation. This indicates the extremely lofty expectations that investors have for the stock today. When the P/E ratio is this high, it adds downside risk to the equation. Should Celsius miss Wall Street revenue forecasts, for example, by even a few million dollars, the stock could crater. Or if management provides weak guidance, shares could tank.\n\nCelsius bulls have probably viewed its ascent similarly to Monster, the $62 billion market cap energy drink rival whose stock skyrocketed 51,000% over the past 20 years. Investors who might have missed that boat aren't going to miss the chance to own an industry newcomer, which perhaps might help explain the meteoric rise of Celsius' shares.\n\nCelsius' tremendous growth\n\nI can't argue with Celsius' ridiculously impressive growth over the past few years. Revenue totaled $131 million three years ago in 2020. In 2023, it came in at $1.3 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNo wonder the stock has done so well. By focusing on how the company's energy drinks are positioned from a marketing and branding perspective, mainly as functional beverages that mix natural ingredients with caffeine, Celsius has caught on with consumers in a major way.\n\nThe brand is the top-selling energy drink on Amazon, ahead of Red Bull and the aforementioned Monster. That's an impressive feat. The e-commerce site has billions of visitors each month, providing a wide potential customer base for Celsius.\n\nAnother recent development that should help the business is the partnership with PepsiCo. The beverage and snacks giant handles distribution for Celsius both in the U.S. and internationally, a deal that started in August of last year.\n\nThis is clearly a business that is firing on all cylinders right now. And it's doing so in a profitable manner as net income totaled $228 million last year. It's hard to find any faults in this regard.\n\nThe issue, though, is that the market is fully aware of how fantastic Celsius is doing. When expectations are this high, as characterized by the steep P/E ratio, it looks like shares are priced for perfection.\n\nI'm also not so convinced that Celsius has long-term staying power. There are basically no barriers to entry preventing anyone with enough start-up capital from creating their own energy drink. Moreover, consumer tastes and preferences are always changing. Time will tell what the industry looks like a decade from now, but these are just my observations.\n\nCelsius has crushed it for investors in the past five years. From today's vantage point, though, I don't think it's a smart buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Celsius wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Wall Street has witnessed a dream run in the first quarter of 2024 after an impressive 2023. Year to date, the three major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 have advanced 5.4%, 10.7% and 11.1%, respectively. However, some intermittent fluctuations continued to hit U.S. stock markets.\n\nIn this regard, inclusion of some defensive stocks from the miscellaneous food industry will safeguard your portfolio if the market rally pauses due to internal or external reasons. The food industry exhibited resilience in the face of economic challenges in 2023 and looks well-placed for this year.\n\nThe last year was marked by inflation, which not only spiked up input costs for manufacturers but also weighed on consumers\u2019 purchasing power, thereby affecting sales volumes of food space. However, an effective combination of a strong brand presence and a strategic pricing approach has empowered these companies to navigate the volatile economic landscape.\n\nNear-Term Positives\n\nCompanies in this industry have been benefiting from robust pricing strategies implemented to weather the economic storm. Brand strength has been another major upside. Consumers\u2019 loyalty to specific brands, combined with companies' unwavering focus on innovation, has been a driving force.\n\nFor instance, companies have been responding well to the growing consumer preference for healthy and nutritious food by introducing innovations in the organic product sector. The focus on expanding plant-based alternatives has particularly benefited companies offering meat products, which remain a significant component of consumers' shopping carts.\n\nApart from this, endeavors to enhance manufacturing capabilities and strengthen product portfolios have proven successful for numerous food companies, positioning them favorably for future growth. Their ability to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and market dynamics has emerged as a winning formula.\n\nThe Zacks-defined Consumer Staples \u2013 Miscellaneous Food Industry is currently in the top 26% of the Zacks Industry Rank. The industry has gained 5.2% year to date. Since it is ranked in the top half of Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect the consulting services industry to outperform the market over the next three to six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five miscellaneous food stocks that have strong growth potential for 2024.

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Food - Miscellaneous stocks have likely encountered both General Mills (GIS) and Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nGeneral Mills and Celsius Holdings Inc. are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nGIS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.17, while CELH has a forward P/E of 83.75. We also note that GIS has a PEG ratio of 2.36. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 2.66.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for GIS is its P/B ratio of 4. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CELH has a P/B of 80.04.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help GIS earn a Value grade of B, while CELH has been given a Value grade of F.\n\nBoth GIS and CELH are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that GIS is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH).\n\nCelsius currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy, representing 85.7% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Celsius here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Celsius, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs CELH Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Celsius, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 14.6% over the past month to $1.09.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Celsius. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Celsius may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector gained 1.81%, while the S&P 500 gained 5.11%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Celsius Holdings Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. On that day, Celsius Holdings Inc. is projected to report earnings of $0.20 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 53.85%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $390.22 million, reflecting a 50.12% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.09 per share and revenue of $1.87 billion, which would represent changes of +41.56% and +41.62%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Celsius Holdings Inc. should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

        "content": "Indicating that growth stocks are in the initial stages of a hot comeback, the iSharesRussell 2000 (NYSEARCA:IWM), whose movements are largely determined by growth stocks, is up nearly 5% year-to-date. Moreover, on March 20, the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s Summary of Economic projections indicated that the central bank still intends to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points this year.\n\nThat outlook is likely to make the Street, which tends to view rates as extremely important for growth stocks, much more positive about those equities. And, lower rates will indeed help many of these companies, since a high percentage of them have to borrow a great deal of money in order to expand. Given all of these points, I believe that this is an excellent time to buy these hot growth stocks.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nEnergy drink maker Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has jumped to around $90 from $50 at the end of January, making it one of the more electrifying hot stocks. The popularity of the company\u2019s healthy carbonated drinks appears to be growing very rapidly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nProviding evidence that the latter trend is continuing, the company\u2019s sales growth for the four-week period ending on March 9 came in at 67% versus the same period a year. Also noteworthy is that the firm\u2019s Q1 revenue appears to be poised to come in above analysts\u2019 average estimate.\n\nFurther, there is indeed some evidence that Celsius\u2019 beverages can help adults burn fat.\n\nAurora Innovation (AUR) a phone displaying the Aurora website in front of a computer screen displaying the company logo\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nThe shares of Aurora (NASDAQ:AUR), which is developing self-driving technology, called the Aurora Driver, jumped from $2.17 on March 11 to $2.44 on March 20.\n\nThe company confirmed at its Investor Day, held on March 14, that it expects the commercial launch of its technology to occur later this year. The firm added that it anticipates that it will start to generate positive gross margins by the end of 2026 and become self-funding by the end of 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, AUR reported that trucks powered by Aurora Driver will be safer and able to operate more hours than existing trucks, while also enabling companies to solve the driver shortage issues which has been plaguing the industry.\n\nAmong the firm\u2019s partners are trucking heavyweights Uber (NYSE:UBER), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Schneider (OTCMKTS:SBGSY) and Volvo (OTCMKTS:VLVLY).\n\nXpeng (XPEV) XPeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nXpeng (NYSE:XPEV) has soared from $7.87 on Feb. 5 to over $9.40 on March 21. The Chinese electric-vehicle maker reported impressive fourth-quarter results on March 19 as its top line soared 154% versus the same period a year earlier while its Q4 gross margin jumped 8.9% year-over-year to 6.2%.\n\nAlso importantly, the firm intends to launch 10 brand new models over the next three years while starting to sell its EVs in additional countries.\n\nAnd in an extremely promising development, the automaker reported that it plans to introduce affordable EVs that incorporate its state-of-the-art advanced driver assistance system. These EVs, which will be available in China and other countries, will cost only $14,000 to $21,000.\n\nI\u2019m unaware of any other vehicles on the market that cost so little and include a top-notch advanced driver assistance system. As a result, I think that these vehicles will become quite popular.\n\nSo if Xpeng can generate positive gross margins on these EVs, I believe that they will wind up greatly boosting the firm\u2019s bottom line and XPEV stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in CELH,AUR,and XPEV.

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this company have returned +39% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, to which Celsius Holdings Inc. belongs, has gained 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Celsius Holdings Inc. is expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share, indicating a change of +53.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.09 points to a change of +41.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +14.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.53 indicates a change of +40.5% from what Celsius Holdings Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +17.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Celsius Holdings Inc.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Celsius Holdings Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $390.22 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +50.1%. The $1.87 billion and $2.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +41.6% and +30.3%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. reported revenues of $347.44 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +95.2%. EPS of $0.17 for the same period compares with $0.01 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $326.55 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.4%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Celsius Holdings Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Stocks That Are on Their Way to Doubling in 2024",
        "content": "The market's been moving higher this year, but hold off on the party favors. You may be surprised by how many stocks are truly off to the races. Less than three dozen companies with market caps of at least $2 billion are up at least 50% in 2024. Can they keep the good times rolling?\n\nCelsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH), Sweetgreen(NYSE: SG), and Instacart(NASDAQ: CART) are among the 35 companies with market valuations north of $2 billion that are up at least 50% this year. They are positioned well to more than double this year. Let's go over why they might get there.\n\n1. Celsius: Up 64%\n\nShares of Celsius are sparkling this year, and that's fitting since it's a fast-growing player in sparkling functional beverages. This year's initial jump isn't a fluke. The stock has more than tripled over the past year. Celsius is a five-bagger over the past three years and a jaw-dropping 63-bagger over the past five years.\n\nGrowth will inevitably slow for its product line of juice-flavored beverages that help burn fat and calories. But for now, Celsius continues to defy gravity. Bears figured the growth would end last year. They were wrong. They thought the same thing the year before. They were really wrong. This is probably a good time to point out that short interest hit at an all-time high this month. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRevenue has more than doubled for three consecutive years. The company is also profitable, with double-digit percentage beats in every single quarter of 2023.\n\nStateside growth will slow, but it's time for international growth to take over. Celsius announced three new international expansion markets earlier this year, something worth watching since international sales currently account for just 4% of its top-line results.\n\nLet's close with a data point that may blow you away. Set aside the energy drink maker's tendency to blow through profit targets: The beverage stock is a 62-bagger over the past five years, and it's trading for 57 times next year's earnings. You could've bought all of Celsius five years ago for less than what it should earn next year.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Sweetgreen: Up 95%\n\nPremium salad spinner Sweetgreen was a hot debutante when it hit the market at $28 in late 2021. The IPO opened at $52. By March of last year, the stock bottomed out at a little over $6. The concept was expanding at a brisk pace, but a lack of profitability was just one problem keeping Sweetgreen off the radars of growth investors.\n\nSweetgreen is a seller of high-priced salads. It thrives on busy lunch crowds, often consisting of affluent office workers placing combined orders. A big revenue driver for the chain is Sweetgreen Outpost, a batch delivery program through which businesses apply for in-office delivery stations. Orders get pooled every morning, delivered before lunchtime. The program was hit hard in the pandemic, but it's thriving now that companies are back to in-office work and personal connections.\n\nRevenue rose a better-than-expected 29% in its latest quarter. New eatery openings and a 6% increase in same-store sales are driving the top-line growth. Sweetgreen is still posting losses, but its restaurant-level profit margin is dramatically improving. Investors have responded, with the shares more than tripling over the past year. The stock has already nearly doubled this year, and it's only mid-March.\n\n3. Instacart: Up 59%\n\nI wasn't the only one initially hesitant when Instacart hit the market in the fall of last year. Did we really need another publicly traded player in the cutthroat world of third-party delivery apps? The market's initial reaction was a yawn. Instacart went public at $30, and that's exactly where it closed at the end of its first week of trading.\n\nBusiness hasn't improved since its trading floor premiere. The same company with a prospectus that promoted a compound annual growth rate of 80% between 2018 and 2022 in its prospectus has slowed. Revenue rose just 19% in 2023, half of the growth it posted the year before. In its first quarter as a public company, sales rose a mere 6%, and it announced layoffs in February.\n\nBut Instacart knows a thing or two about the grocery aisle, and its saving grace is that its business model is already profitable. It also dominates its niche. Analysts see revenue growing a modest 8% this year and 9% come 2025, but they also see profitability improving sharply in that time. Don't obsess about the ingredients.

        "content": "If you want to know which growth stocks to sell this month, you\u2019re in the right place. Growth stocks have had a tremendous start to 2024. Between artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, quantum computing and other cutting-edge breakthroughs, this is a promising time for the sector.\n\nEven with all these promising developments, however, that isn\u2019t a green light for all growth stocks. In fact, much of the rally in growth stocks was premised on the idea that the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates meaningfully in 2024. Instead, the economy remains strong and inflation hasn\u2019t declined as much as anticipated.\n\nBetween high valuations and the potential for the Fed walking back prior support to the market, the growth space could be set for a major correction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, not all growth stocks are created equal. In fact, some are quite risky here following their tremendous rallies over the past year. These are seven growth stocks to sell that look especially risky for March 2024 and beyond.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Crowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the epitome of a good company selling at a ridiculous price. While Crowdstrike has a promising business with favorable growth prospects, the market has gotten far too optimistic, setting up inevitable disappointment later this year.\n\nMany software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies traded up to incredibly high price-to-sales ratios in 2021 and then saw their share prices collapse in 2022 as financial gravity kicked in. You might think that investors would learn their lesson from the collapse of these formerly high-flying software firms.\n\nAnd yet, Crowdstrike has recovered all of its 2022 losses. In fact, with a more than 150% rally over the past 12 months, CRWD stock has now reached new all-time highs. This time around, traders are pointing to potential AI benefits in the cybersecurity space. That could well be the case, but it will be a competitive race to deploy AI in cybersecurity and it\u2019s far from assured that Crowdstrike will be the ultimate winner.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut with CRWD stock at more than 80 times forward earnings and at nearly 20 times forward revenues, Crowdstrike is priced for perfection. Any slowdown in revenues or disappointment on the AI front could lead the share price to crash.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn paper, it seems like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) should be a tremendous business. The company is a classic marketplace with tremendous network effects, and it gets to grab a piece of millions of transactions across mobility, food delivery, and other such services.\n\nIn addition, Uber has had a massive opportunity to build brand awareness and loyalty in recent years. The pandemic caused a huge disruption to shopping and dining out, giving Uber the chance to impress customers with efficient food and grocery delivery.\n\nAnd while Uber has grown its business and seen revenues surge, it has still struggled to convert that into consistent profitability. UBER stock is going for a lofty 65 times forward earnings right now.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Uber will be able to push profitability that much farther from here, either. The company is increasingly facing regulatory pushback as consumers and restaurant owners complain about high fees and drivers claim that they are underpaid. All this suggests that Uber will struggle to raise its margins from here which in turn would imply that shares are dramatically overvalued.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Dell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors probably remember Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) as a company that makes personal computers. And Dell still has a large consumer electronics business to be certain.\n\nHowever, it merged with EMC in 2016, and in doing so, it became a leader in storage, information security, and consulting functions as well. DELL stock has hummed along, largely under the radar, for many years due to its largely unglamorous collection of business operations.\n\nThat has changed recently, however, with DELL stock rising an incredible 199% over the past 12 months.\n\nIn particular, DELL stock has soared more than 35% over the past month. This came following an earnings report where Dell highlighted rapid growth in its AI server sales. Despite this, however, Dell\u2019s overall revenues actually declined 11% year-over-year for the quarter.\n\nAt this price, investors are pricing in way too much optimism based on Dell\u2019s AI functions, even as the overall business is not showing much favorable momentum. Morningstar\u2019s William Kerwin agrees; he believes DELL shares are worth just $55 each, implying that the stock has more than 50% downside from here once the AI server hype fades.\n\nSoundhound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Dell, I believe Soundhound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) has rallied more due to general enthusiasm around artificial intelligence than any specific strengths at this particular company.\n\nSoundhound AI is a small unprofitable firm that aims to develop and commercialize voice, sound, and natural language artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nSOUN stock quadrupled in February. This came due to news that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) had taken a position in Soundhound AI. Sounds great, right? However, Nvidia invests in a variety of smaller companies, and these bets can be quite small. Reportedly, Nvidia invested a modest $3.7 million in SOUN stock, which is better than nothing but not necessarily a massive vote of confidence either.\n\nSOUN stock has cooled off a bit recently following a disappointing earnings report. While revenues grew sharply, the company reported a wider-than-expected operating loss and hasn\u2019t even reached breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis yet. Shares seem wildly overvalued at their current $1.8 billion market capitalization given that analysts foresee just $70 million in revenues for 2024.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Celsius Holdings (CELH) A view of several cans of Celsius (CELH) energy drinks, on display at a local grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnergy drink marker Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has given its investors a jolt. CELH stock is up 200% over the past year, and a stunning 7,000% over the past five years.\n\nNeedless to say, early investors in Celsius have enjoyed blockbuster returns. But at some point, the risk/reward ratio turns against shareholders. We are at that point today following Celsius stock\u2019s 56% year-to-date rally.\n\nIncredibly, Celsius has posted these incredible gains even as the company\u2019s latest quarterly report saw its earnings per share fall short of expectations. Yes, revenues are still soaring, but the firm appears to be giving up ground on pricing to drive its revenue growth, leading to slipping profit margins.\n\nIn the bigger picture, Celsius had a tremendous run when it was a small company. But it is now a more mature business with fewer growth opportunities that faces robust competition. This will make it exceedingly difficult for CELH stock to maintain its current 80 times forward P/E ratio.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) is a leading pharmaceutical company that offers treatments for a wide variety of ailments.\n\nThe firm has enjoyed incredible performance over the past year thanks to its GLP-1 drugs, including Mounjaro, which have become blockbuster products for helping with weight loss and diabetes management.\n\nThese drugs are helping lots of people, and the company\u2019s sales are likely to continue to grow in the coming years. However, the valuation has seemingly gotten way out of hand, with LLY stock up more than 125% over the past year. Eli Lilly now has a market capitalization of almost $700 billion and sells for a stunning 60 times forward earnings.\n\nAnalysts project that Lilly will bring in about $41 billion in annual revenues this year, and topline growth is around 20%. That\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s not nearly enough to support a $700 billion market cap given the short patent lives of pharmaceutical drugs before they give way to generic competition.\n\nEli Lilly is enjoying a windfall right now, but the party is going to end a lot sooner than LLY stockholders realize.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava (NYSE:CAVA) is a fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain. The company completed its IPO in 2023 and the stock has now doubled since last fall.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see why there is so much enthusiasm, though. The bull case is that Cava can be the Chipotle of Greek food. In a vacuum, that may sound like an enticing pitch. But many fast casual chains have tried to become the Chipotle of some specific cuisine and the vast majority invariably fizzle out.\n\nThe fast casual dining market is far more competitive than it used to be. And inflation and economic strain are putting pressure on consumers. This adds up to a scary outlook for CAVA stock given that it is trading at a jaw-dropping 200 times forward earnings and 10 times revenues today. Those sorts of multiples are hard for restaurants to maintain even if their business execution is perfect.\n\nMy guess is that Cava will be more like the next\u00a0Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK). Shake Shack, you may recall, went public back in 2015 and became a momentum stock for a time with traders bidding it up fourfold following the IPO.\n\nSince then, SHAK shares have underperformed despite a dramatic amount of growth in its underlying business. Given Cava\u2019s similarly sky-high multiples, it will take many years for the company\u2019s growth to catch up with today\u2019s stock price, if it ever does at all.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

While momentum stocks often lose momentum eventually, investors can protect themselves by setting up a stop-loss order or adopting dollar-cost averaging.

SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI\u2019s (NASDAQ:SOUN) shares jumped 236.22% in the last month. The company\u2019s technology enables AI systems to directly understand human speech.\n\nThe big catalyst for SOUN\u2019s surge was Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) decision to purchase $3.7 million of SOUN stock last quarter. Additionally, many large firms, such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Square (NYSE:SQ), Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) are utilizing SOUN\u2019s system.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSoundHound AI\u2019s ability to attract such an impressive customer roster, along with the investment from Nvidia, certainly bodes well for the firm\u2019s outlook. Despite its large price-sales ratio of 34 times, its recent strong performance makes it one of the most promising momentum stocks to buy.\n\nCelsius (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius\u2019 (NASDAQ:CELH) shares have jumped 57.78% in the last month. Moreover, the shares were recently rising slightly above their 52-week high of $91.36.\n\nLast quarter, Celsius\u2019 top line soared 95% versus the same period a year earlier to a record $347 million, while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, jumped 387% year-over-year to about $65 million.\n\nCEO John Fieldly attributed the firm\u2019s growth to expanding availability of its products and increased consumer awareness.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the wake of the results, investment bank Cowen stated that the firm maintained strong momentum.\n\nHowever, the shares do have a very high forward price-earnings ratio of over 80 at this point.\n\nXpeng (XPEV) The Logo of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng (Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors, also known as XMotors.ai) on tablet. XPEV Stock. momentum stocks\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock\n\nXpeng\u2019s (NASDAQ:XPEV) shares have advanced 19.15% in the last month.\n\nMorgan Stanley recently wrote that three Chinese electric-vehicle names, including Xpeng, could rebound meaningfully this year. The bank believes that any negative economic conditions are already baked into their stock prices.\n\nMoreover, Morgan Stanley expects the firms to benefit from \u201cgreen shoots\u201d starting in the second quarter of this year. The bank kept an \u201coverweight\u201d rating on XPEV stock, and it expects the firm\u2019s sales growth to increase in Q2, driven by its new models. Morgan Stanley has an $18 price target on the shares.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that Xpeng could benefit over the longer term from its deal, announced on February 29, to launch two B-class battery EVs in partnership with Volkswagen (OTCmkts:VWAGY). Moreover, the two firms agreed to jointly buy parts, which should meaningfully lower production costs.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in CELH and XPEV.

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) Is Up 12.14% in One Week: What You Should Know",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Celsius Holdings Inc. Currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if CELH is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this company holds up.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nFor CELH, shares are up 12.14% over the past week while the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 52.24% compares favorably with the industry's 0.18% performance as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Celsius Holdings Inc. Have risen 78.93%, and are up 221.25% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.65% and 30.03%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to CELH's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. CELH is currently averaging 6,340,726 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CELH.\n\nOver the past two months, 9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 3 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CELH's consensus estimate, increasing from $0.97 to $1.09 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that CELH is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Celsius Holdings Inc. On your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "In a move that underscores its ongoing commitment to shareholder value, SpartanNash Co. SPTN has approved an increase in its quarterly cash dividend.\r\n\r\nOn Mar 6, 2024, management unveiled a quarterly cash dividend of 21.75 cents per common share, which indicates an increase of 1.2% from the fiscal 2023 quarterly dividend of 21.5 cents per share.\r\n\r\nThis decision reflects not only the company's stable financial performance but also its strategic approach towards fostering investor confidence and securing a robust financial footing. By increasing the dividend, SpartanNash signals its operational strength and its ability to maintain a consistent growth trajectory, even in the face of the dynamic challenges that the food solutions industry often presents.\r\n\r\nScheduled for payment on Mar 28, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Mar 14, 2024, this enhanced dividend is an indicator of SpartanNash's prudent financial management and its focus on sustainable growth. It serves as a tangible expression of the company's dedication to rewarding its investors and reaffirming their faith in its strategic direction.\r\n\r\nAs the food solutions industry continues to evolve, SpartanNash's latest dividend increase is a clear message of its resilience and optimistic outlook. With a solid foundation of 34,469,289 common shares outstanding as of the announcement, this prominent player in the food solutions sector is well-positioned to navigate the complexities of the market while continuing to deliver value to its shareholders. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Growth Endeavors\n\nSpartanNash has been diligently working on several strategic initiatives and fundamental growth factors aimed at enhancing its operational excellence and community engagement, thereby solidifying its market position and future growth trajectory.\r\n\r\nThe company is expanding the use of Simbe's autonomous inventory robot, Tally, to 60 additional stores across the Midwest after a successful pilot in 15 stores. Tally provides real-time inventory insights, helping associates save time and ensuring that products are fresh, stocked and competitively priced. This move is part of SpartanNash's investment in technology to improve the shopping experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the fourth quarter, the company faced challenges in both its wholesale and retail segments. Wholesale net sales dropped 2% year over year to $1.598 billion, mainly due to decreased volume in the national accounts channel. Retail net sales also fell 4.5% to $647 million, with comparable store sales declining 2.8%, largely due to reduced food assistance benefits and lower fuel sales.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have declined 9.4% in the past three months against the industry\u2019s growth of 17.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome Better-Ranked Staple Bets\n\nHere, we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely, Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM, Sovos Brands Inc. SOVO and Celsius Holdings CELH.\r\n\r\nSovos Brands Inc. is a food company. Its brand portfolio includes Rao's, a premium line of sauces. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sovos Brands\u2019 current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 12.8% and 16.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers. SOVO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.4%, on average.\r\n\r\nSprouts Farmers Market, Inc. operates in a highly fragmented grocery store industry. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprouts Farmers Market\u2019s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.8% and 3.9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures. SFM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10%, on average.\r\n\r\nCelsius Holdings, which offers functional drinks and liquid supplements, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). CELH has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 67.4%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Celsius Holdings\u2019 current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 41.6% each from the year-ago reported numbers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Shorting the Shorts: 3 Stocks Primed for an Epic Squeeze",
        "content": "Danish researchers published a report on the arXiv.org open-access archive for scholarly articles in February about the Jan. 2021 short squeeze of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME). The researchers found that the subreddit community WallStreetBets 's(WSB) desire to find and invest in stocks primed for short squeeze had a role in GME\u2019s short squeeze from more than three years ago.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe estimated that the size of the total position of WSB users amounted to at least 1% of GME market capitalization, demonstrating a tangible engagement of the WSB community in the stock market\u201d the report\u2019s conclusion stated.\u00a0\n\nThere is no question that the WSB community affected GameStop\u2019s massive short squeeze, which saw GME stock go from less than $5 to over $80 in three weeks. While WSB's influence isn\u2019t nearly as strong as it once was, Reddit is set to go public in mere days, a sign that it\u2019s become part of the investment community\u2019s inner circle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMaybe there won\u2019t be another one like GME\u2019s, but just in case, here are three stocks primed for a short squeeze.\u00a0\n\nMGP Ingredients (MGPI)\n\nMGP Ingredients (NASDAQ:MGPI) used to produce distilled spirits for other brands. In April 2021, it diversified into its own brands when it acquired Luxco, a maker of bourbon brands such as Rebel Yell, for $475 million. The acquisition was part of the company\u2019s growth stategy focused on producing higher-value products.\u00a0\n\nIn 2023, its Luxco division acquired Penelope Bourbon for $105 million plus potential payouts of $111 million based on meeting specific performance targets.\n\nPenelope was already being distilled at MGP\u2019s Lawrenceburg, Indiana distillery, so the acquisition makes sense. Penelope sells 50,000 cases annually, growing by more than 160% year-over-year.\u00a0\n\nNot everyone believes MGP\u2019s premiumization strategy is a good idea. As of Feb. 15, it had 3.28 million shares short, accounting for 23.73% of its float. The company reported full-year results on Feb. 22.\u00a0\n\nThe move into higher-value products increased its gross margin by 610 basis points in 2023 to 42.5%. The company's adjusted operating income increased 21% in 2023 to $180.3 million, a 21.6% operating margin, 260 basis points higher than a year ago.\u00a0\n\nMGPI stock is primed for a short squeeze.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEncore Wire (WIRE)\n\nEncore Wire (NYSE:WIRE) is a Texas-based manufacturer of copper and aluminum building wire used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. The company started in 1989, going public three years later, in July 1992, around $3 a share.\u00a0\n\nI first recommended Encore in December 2022, along with six other small-cap stocks. My sentiment was the same then, as it is now, that it would continue to capture market share. Encore's shares are up 59% in the 15 months since, 29% better than the S&amp;P 500.\n\nEncore had a down year this past year due to a 17.8% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire in 2023, partly offset by a 6.7% increase in pounds of copper shipped. As a result of the nearly 15% decline in revenue in 2023 to $2.57 billion, Encore's gross profit margin fell 11.4 percentage points to 25.5% from 36.9% a year earlier.\u00a0\n\nPrices are a part of the business it can\u2019t control. However, It can control its balance sheet. As of Dec. 31, Encore had no outstanding long-term debt and $560.6 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. That was down from 2022 but still represented a high 16% of its market capitalization.\u00a0\n\nAs of Feb. 15, it had 3.36 million shares short, accounting for 22.87% of its float.\u00a0\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH)\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is having a down year by its standards, up 61% in 2024. Over the past five years, it\u2019s gained a whopping 5,387%. It is the modern version of Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST).\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m unsure why investors would short Celsius, given that PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is in its corner. In Aug. 2022, PepsiCo invested $550 million in Celsius convertible preferred shares, which pay a 5% annual dividend and are convertible into 8.5% of the company\u2019s common stock at $75 a share, solidifying its role as the U.S. distributor.\u00a0\n\nOn Jan. 22, Celsius announced expansion into Canada through Pepsi\u2014I\u2019ve seen it prominently placed in my local grocery store\u2014and the UK and Ireland through Suntory Beverage &amp; Food.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn 2023, Celsius\u2019s revenues were $1.32 billion, 102% higher than a year earlier. North American revenues were up 105%, while international revenues saw a 52% boost. Celsius's gross margin also increased 660 basis points YOY to 48.0%.\u00a0\n\nIts adjusted EBITDA jumped 316% to $295.6 million, an EBITDA margin of 22.4%. In comparison, Monster Beverage\u2019s EBITDA margin in 2023 was 28.5%, 610 basis points higher. However, Monster\u2019s margin is barely growing, while Celsius has plenty of room to grow its margin over the next several years.\u00a0\n\nCelsius has 36.31 million shares sold short, accounting for 22.81% of its float. Of the three names covered here, CELH would be my least likely to short.",

        "content": "Finding the best-kept Wall Street secrets is tough because, well, if it were easy, they wouldn\u2019t be secrets. Today\u2019s top stocks tend to be large-cap tech names with rapid (and arguably unsustainable) growth that frustrates latecomer investors when that momentum slows.\n\nThat\u2019s why, to find the best-kept Wall Street secrets, you need to satisfy two core criteria: identify emerging market opportunities and find small- or medium-cap stocks with great growth stats that target the new sector. These three stocks demonstrate that strong growth while their respective industries\u2014B2B eCommerce, ready-to-drink alcohol, and work-from-home furniture\u2014are just beginning a long and fruitful upward trajectory.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) e-commerce stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe know that globalized, direct-to-purchaser eCommerce will only keep climbing in popularity \u2013 think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) is similar, but as one of the best-kept Wall Street secrets, the eCommerce company targets the massive B2B market to create a one-stop shop for businesses to source products and manage everything that entails.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nProduct and inventory management \u2013 not to mention sourcing and payment processing \u2013 are a tough nut to crack for medium-sized businesses. GigaCloud offers the full suite of scaled B2B eCommerce needs, including an active vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment, and, critically, facilitates cross-border payment safely and securely.\n\nOn its face, the company\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio is surprisingly low, sitting at just 19x compared to the wider tech sector\u2019s 36 times average ratio. The difference is even starker when you look at GigaCloud\u2019s earnings growth. The company doubled its earnings per share over the past four quarters, with free cash flow per share staying strong\u2014even as, critically, the company trades at just 0.68 times sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nVita Coco Company (COCO) A line of Vita Coco (COCO) waters on a shelf.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeverage stocks like Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) remain all the rage, but one competitor\u2014Vita Coco Company (NASDAQ:COCO)\u2014remains one of the best-kept Wall Street secrets. While the energy drink markets, and even standard sports drink segments, face steep competition, Vita Coco stands alone among coconut water vendors. The company owns more than half the total addressable market today.\n\nBetter yet, through a strategic partnership with British booze brand Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), Vita Coco is making inroads toward the ready-to-drink alcoholic beverage market with a range of spiked coconut water options. While coconut water mixed with Captain Morgan isn\u2019t my cup of tea, that emerging market is exploding and expected to grow at a 7.5% CAGR through 2029\u2014and Vita Coco is set to snag a large portion of that market.\n\nOn the financial front, Vita Coco blew analysts away with an end-of-year 4% earnings beat, driven by a nearly 500% yearly net income increase alongside a 9.4% profit margin. We all know the story of how Monster became one of the century\u2019s top-performing stocks\u2014but this best-kept Wall Street secret may be on its way to doing the same.\n\nSteelcase Inc (SCS) A staged room with a blue chair in focus.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThough work-from-home trends are weighing on some Wall Street sectors (like commercial real estate), high-end office furniture manufacturer and best-kept Wall Street secret Steelcase Inc (NYSE:SCS) is flourishing in this new environment. The company\u2019s recent dividend increase affirms this success, offering investors 2.88% yield.\n\nSteelcase quickly rebounded from the post-pandemic supply chain shocks and muted corporate furniture spending. Its latest quarterly earnings report revealed a net income of $30.8 million, a significant increase from the previous year\u2019s figures. Meanwhile, the company has maintained steady sales, hovering around $800 million over the last five quarters, indicating that Steelcase has been enhancing its profit margins without compromising on quality.\n\nThe company is actively adjusting its strategy to fit the work-from-home era, aiming for a 5-7% annual increase in sales and targeting a 5% free cash flow margin relative to revenue over the next five years. Additionally, Steelcase has taken decisive steps to reduce its debt amid rising interest rates, bolstering its liquidity and minimizing interest expenses. This strategic financial management positions Steelcase as one of the best-kept Wall Street secrets today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors making bearish wagers against Celsius Holdings Inc. are licking their wounds after the energy-drink maker set record closing highs in three of the past four sessions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHuawei Chip Breakthrough Used Tech From Two US Gear Suppliers Chemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Nasdaq 100 Falls 1% as Stock Rally Hits a Wall: Markets Wrap China Readies $27 Billion Chip Fund to Counter Growing US Curbs TSMC to Win More Than $5 Billion in Grants for US Chip Plant\n\nShares traded above $91 on Friday, another all-time high. The company \u2014 which claims its drinks have calorie-burning properties \u2014 has been snapping up market share from its heftier peers, Monster Beverage Corp. and Red Bull GmbH, according to Circana data. That\u2019s helped fuel a more than 60% rally year-to-date, leaving short sellers looking at paper losses of about $1.25 billion, according to data from S3 Partners LLC.\n\nThe stock\u2019s advance defies the pressures spilling across the broader food and drink industry from a new crop of appetite-suppressing weight loss drugs. The brand\u2019s positioning as a cleaner, healthier alternative and partnership with PepsiCo. have helped it outperform rivals despite increasing competition.\n\nCelsius is \u201ca disruptor within non-alcoholic beverages, a disruptor within energy drinks, and you really saw them over the course of 2023 transform the business,\u201d according to Gerald Pascarelli, a Wedbush analyst. \u201cTheir velocities in terms of consumer takeaway trends, continue to outpace peers and it\u2019s resulting in pretty significant market share gains, which has been very consistent.\u201d\n\nCelsius\u2019s share of the energy-drink market in dollars approached 12% in February as the top two competitors, Monster and Red Bull, fight to hold onto their claims of roughly a third of the market each. Celsius\u2019s foothold has helped the stock, which over the past year has more than tripled, while Coca-Cola Co.-partnered Monster has risen about 15%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast week\u2019s earnings \u2014 which showed annual revenue doubling from the prior year \u2014 were also a boon for shares. Stock bears had concerns about whether Celsius could sustain its strength heading into the report, those investors are now covering their short positions, according to Cowen analyst Robert Moskow.\n\n\u201cGiven the high short interest heading into the print, this commentary blew a hole in the bear thesis that distribution was fully cooked and that top-line growth would be harder to come by going forward, sending shares higher,\u201d Moskow wrote in a note dated March 1.\n\nWall Street is predominantly bullish on Celsius with 15 analysts rating the stock a buy, only two assigning it a hold and one a sell. But the stock\u2019s sizzling rally has left nearly half the analysts\u2019 price targets straining to keep up with the share price, suggesting Celsius may be near a peak.\n\nOn Monday, Wedbush dropped Celsius from the bank\u2019s best ideas list. \u201cSome of the upside had been expedited over the strength really seen over the course of February, certainly on earnings day,\u201d Pascarelli said.\n\nStill, he rates the stock outperform. With Monster expected to raise prices later in the year that could drive Celsius to follow suit and be positive for sector margins, according to Pascarelli.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Kenneth Shea sees Celsius\u2019s growth as sustainable. He views the upstart company as a pure energy-drink play in \u201carguably one of the best categories within the whole packaged beverage space.\u201d\n\n\u201cCelsius is growing at higher rates from a smaller base and investors pay up for growth, so that\u2019s been a lot of the fuel behind Celsius,\u201d Shea said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built How Microsoft\u2019s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing\u2019s Great Firewall The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World\u2019s Most Coveted Office Chair Airbus Is Soaring at Boeing\u2019s Expense Elon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Investors interested in Food - Miscellaneous stocks are likely familiar with Utz Brands (UTZ) and Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nRight now, both Utz Brands and Celsius Holdings Inc. are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nUTZ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 26.16, while CELH has a forward P/E of 80.33. We also note that UTZ has a PEG ratio of 1.59. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CELH currently has a PEG ratio of 2.56.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for UTZ is its P/B ratio of 1.79. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CELH has a P/B of 76.77.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help UTZ earn a Value grade of B, while CELH has been given a Value grade of D.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth UTZ and CELH are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that UTZ is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) Upgraded to Buy: Here's Why",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Celsius Holdings Inc. basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Celsius Holdings Inc. imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Celsius Holdings Inc.\n\nThis company is expected to earn $1.06 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 37.7%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Celsius Holdings Inc. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 9.8%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Celsius Holdings Inc. to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this company have returned +55.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. The Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, to which Celsius Holdings Inc. belongs, has gained 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Celsius Holdings Inc. is expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share, indicating a change of +53.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.06 points to a change of +37.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +11.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.53 indicates a change of +43.9% from what Celsius Holdings Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +17%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Celsius Holdings Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Celsius Holdings Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $390.22 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +50.1%. The $1.87 billion and $2.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +41.6% and +30.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. reported revenues of $347.44 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +95.2%. EPS of $0.17 for the same period compares with $0.01 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $326.55 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.4%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Celsius Holdings Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) has emerged as one of the U.S. stock market's top performers over the past decade. Its share price has soared from 26 cents in February 2014 to $64.50 at the time of writing, generating an impressive return of nearly 21,910% or an annualized compounded return of 72.3% over the last 10 years.\n\nDespite the recent rapid increase in its share price, I maintain an optimistic outlook for Celsius' long-term potential upside. This optimism is based on the company's high growth potential and its ability to improve its operating profitability going forward.\n\nBusiness overview\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CELH.\n\nCelsius is the manufacturer and distributor of functional energy drinks and protein bars. Its flagship product, CELSIUS, an energy drink that provides energy while burning calories and body fat. The company's products are distributed through various channels, including convenience stores, mass market, fitness and e-commerce. Celsius ranks as the third-largest player in the U.S. energy drink market, holding a 5.90% market share. It follows Red Bull and Monster (NASDAQ:MNST), which hold market shares of 39.50% and 29.70%. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nSource: Statista\n\nCelsius derives its revenue from three main customers. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is the largest one, accounting for 22% of the total revenue in 2022. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) ranked second, representing 16.7% of total sales. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stood in third place with 8.80% of the revenue. These leading customers are main distributors of Celsius' products, giving consumers considerable confidence in the brand.\n\nNotably, PepsiCo has become the primary distributor for Celsius products in the U.S since August 2022. It also invested $550 million in Celsius' convertible preferred stock, further strengthening the bond between the two companies. I consider the agreement with PepsiCo as a game changer. As PepsiCo is the globally recognized brand with world-wide distribution channels, the deal with PepsiCo opens the door for Celsius to unlimited growth opportunities in both U.S. and international markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuperb revenue growth with dismal operating profitability\n\nCelsius has managed to grow its revenue every single year for the past 10 years. Remarkably, its revenue soared 85-fold, climbing from $7.68 million in 2012 to $653.60 million in 2022. This growth translates to an impressive annual compounded growth rate of 56%. Despite this substantial revenue growth, the company recorded operating losses in nine out of the last 10 years. The only profitable year was 2020, where it posted operating profits of $7.83 million. In 2022, its operating income plummeted to a loss of nearly $158 million. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nThe significant operating losses in 2022 can be attributed to a substantial rise in selling and marketing expenses. While revenue more than doubled from $314.30 million in 2021 to $653.60 million in 2022, selling and marketing expenses surged nearly fivefold from $74 million to $353 million in just one year.\n\nA closer examination reveals the selling and marketing expenses for 2022 included $194 million in termination fees paid to previous distributors as part of transitioning to Pepsi to become its primary distributor in the U.S. This expense is one-time, not recurring. After adjusting for these termination expenses, the adjusted selling and marketing costs would be $159 million only.\n\nIt is positive that Celsius has achieved significant operating profits during the first nine months of 2023. During this period, the company reported revenue of $970.60 million and operating profits of $207.40 million, resulting in a substantial operating margin of 21.40%.\n\nDebt-free balance sheet\n\nCelsius has a debt-free balance sheet. As of September, the company holds $760 million in cash and has a shareholders' equity of $213.40 million, with no interest-bearing debt at all. This strong financial position allows Celsius significant flexibility to invest in future growth and expand into international markets. However, maintaining a debt-free balance sheet has come at a cost, specifically in the form of an increasing share count, which leads to the dilution of shareholders' equity. The total number of diluted shares has increased from 60.55 million in 2012 to nearly 227 million in 2022. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nPotential upside\n\nFrom 2018 to mid-2020, the company's enterprise value-to-revenue ratio consistently remained lower than its larger competitor, Monster Beverage. However, since August 2020, its sales multiples has risen rapidly. At the time of writing, Celsius is trading at 12.40 times its sales, while Monster Beverage is trading at 8 times revenue. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nThe higher valuation of Celsius can be justified by its significantly higher revenue growth compared to Monster Beverage. Since 2020, Celsius has experienced annual revenue growth ranging from 50% to 130%, much higher than Monster Beverage's, which experienced sales increase in the range of only 12% to 20%.\n\nAssuming Celsius maintains its historical revenue growth rate of 56% over the next five years, its revenue is projected to reach $12 billion by 2028. If Celsius' operating margin stays at 21%, its operating earnings will be $2.52 billion in 2028. With an earnings multiple of 30, Celsius' enterprise value will be $75.6 billion by 2028. Using a 10% discount rate, the estimated value of Celsius stands at $47 billion. Assuming the company issues 50% more shares over the next five years to fund for its business expansion and acquisitions, the total diluted share count is expected to reach 340 million. Thus, Celsius should be worth $138 per share, 114% higher than its current share price.\n\nConclusion\n\nCelsius Holdings showcases phenomenal business growth, evidenced by its substantial revenue growth and a strong, debt-free balance sheet, emphasizing its financial health. The company's strategic partnership with PepsiCo for the U.S. and international expansion highlights the business' immense potential. Combined with an improving operating margin, Celsius represents a compelling investment opportunity with solid fundamentals and substantial potential upside.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "While the market continues to climb a wall of worries, it\u2019s not a bad idea to consider diversifying into consumer staples stocks to\u00a0 buy. No, the idea here isn\u2019t necessarily to get rich off the ideas (though that would be nice). Instead, it\u2019s to mitigate volatility risks.\n\nSure, a broader downdraft tends to impact all securities. However, certain companies and industries should be able to withstand the pressure better than others. In particular, consumer staples stocks to buy offer a viable platform because of their everyday relevance. Undergirding this sector are the essential products that consumers buy frequently: food, beverages, household goods and even alcohol and tobacco.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not the most exciting arenas to play in. However, when the walls feel like they\u2019re caving in, you\u2019ll be glad to have exposure to these consumer staples stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nKellanova (K) Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in Mississauga\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt might be a new name but it\u2019s still the same core products with Kellanova (NYSE:K). Formerly Kellogg Company, Kellanova represents one of the top consumer staples stocks to buy. A breakfast champion, the enterprise is best known for food products like Frosties, Crunchy Nut and of course Kellogg\u2019s. However, the market doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate the opportunity, with K stock down 5% since the January opener.\n\nNo matter, Kellanova at the moment offers decent value. Right now, shares trade at 13.26X trailing-year earnings without non-recurring items (NRI). As well, the company enjoys robust margins across the board, leading to consistent annual profitability.\n\nTo be fair, analysts estimate on average that Kellanova\u2019s revenue will land at $12.81 billion at the end of this year. That would imply a sales decline of 2.4%. however, a recovery may occur in 2025, leading to revenue of $13.22 billion.\n\nSure enough, the consensus analyst view for K stock is a hold. Nevertheless, I\u2019d keep my eye on it due to its relevance.\n\nStory continues\n\nColgate-Palmolive (CL) Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrush\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother top-tier name among consumer staples stocks to buy, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is a no-brainer. First, its namesake business is a necessity, both from a personal hygiene perspective and a long-term health angle. Besides, it\u2019s not like anyone refuses to brush their teeth just because of a market downturn. Second, the company\u2019s cleaning products represent a core essential activity.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Colgate-Palmolive shares found themselves off to a decent start (relatively speaking). They\u2019re up 7% since the start of the year and returned over 17% in the past 52 weeks. Also to little shock, analysts anticipate that in 2024, the company will post revenue of $20.18 billion. That represents a 3.7% lift from last year\u2019s result. Also, earnings per share should land at $3.48, above 2023\u2019s EPS of $3.23.\n\nTo be sure, CL stock isn\u2019t exactly the greatest deal in town, posting a trailing-year earnings multiple of 31X. However, the company enjoys strong margins and consistent profitability.\n\nAnalysts also view Colgate as a consensus strong buy with an average price target of $91.33.\n\nCelsius (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the questions posed to me is, \u201cJosh, how do you write so many articles without exhausting yourself? My answer: Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH). Basically, if you ever wanted to buy shares of Red Bull but were disappointed to learn that the energy drink giant \u2013 and monster Formula One team \u2013 is privately owned, Celsius offers the next best alternative (arguably).\n\nIt\u2019s a wild success story. Over the past five years, CELH gained 6,675% of market value. Some of my colleagues at TipRanks believe that shares can continue to run higher. Frankly, it\u2019s difficult to disagree. Since the beginning of the year, CELH gained over 34%.\n\nNot only that, analysts anticipate that by the end of this year, Celsius will generate revenue of $1.8 billion. That\u2019s a leap of almost 37% from last year\u2019s result. Also, EPS could land at 97 cents, beating out 2023\u2019s EPS of 77 cents.\n\nIt\u2019s easily one of the top consumer staples stocks to buy, with analysts posting an average price target of $86.55. The high side? We\u2019re talking $110.\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational food company, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) represents a well-known commodity among consumer staples stocks to buy. Should a recession ever materialize, KHC shareholders should be prepared to weather the storm. After all, people will still need their calories. Kraft Heinz can provide just that but at a lower cost than say going out to eat.\n\nOf course, another reason why KHC stock is appealing is because it\u2019s one of the Warren Buffett stocks. The legendary investor loves a good deal and Kraft Heinz provides exactly that. Currently, KHC stock trades at only 11.61X forward earnings. That\u2019s lower than the sector median 15.5X.\n\nLooking ahead to the end of this year, analysts anticipate that the company will post revenue of $26.83 billion. That\u2019s only modest growth of less than 1%. However, a more robust recovery could occur in 2025, with sales rising to $27.32 billion.\n\nAlso, experts peg shares a moderate buy with a $38.47 price target, implying about 10% upside potential.\n\nMondelez (MDLZ) The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMoving into the riskier but possibly more rewarding ideas for consumer staples stocks to buy, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) could be enticing for smart speculators. A multinational food, beverages and snacks company, Mondelez is perhaps best known for its Oreo brand of cookies. Cynically, such confectionaries are addictive \u2013 and that \u201cattribute\u201d bodes well for MDLZ stock.\n\nAnalysts seem to agree. On average, they project that the company will post revenue of $37.13 billion. That comes out to 3.1% growth from last year. In 2025, Wall Street experts believe that revenue will land at $38.77 billion. That would represent 4.4% growth if indeed 2024 sales reach $37.13 billion.\n\nOn the profitability side, Mondelez may produce EPS of $3.52, implying solid growth over last year\u2019s tally of $3.19. And 2025 may generate EPS of $3.81. To be sure, MDLZ stock isn\u2019t offered at a great discount but the underlying company is consistently profitable.\n\nLastly, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with an $83.47 price target, implying over 15% upside potential.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nAt first glance, tobacco giant Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) might seem too controversial and irrelevant for consumer staples stocks to buy. Primarily, global smoking rates have declined conspicuously. Therefore, the total addressable market appears to be shrinking. Add to that the controversies surrounding the sector and you have a poor investment.\n\nNevertheless, analysts have a completely different take. By the end of this fiscal year, they believe that the tobacco firm can generate revenue of $37.17 billion. If so, this tally would represent sales growth of 5.4% from last year\u2019s haul. Looking out to 2025, sales might reach $39.56 billion. That would mean a growth rate of 6.4% against projected 2024 sales.\n\nAlso, covering experts believe that EPS may reach $6.4. That would be a noticeable jump from $6.01 last year. And in 2025, the print could be up to $7.04. Driving the upside narrative is the vaping/e-cigarette industry, which only continues to rise in popularity.\n\nAnalysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $101.94 price target. That translates to over 13% growth potential.\n\nAnheuser-Busch (BUD) Corporate building with Anheuser Busch (BUD) logo on it\n\nSource: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce manufacturing America\u2019s favorite beer, Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) is singing in a more humble tune these days. I don\u2019t want to rehash the controversy that engulfed BUD stock about one year ago. You can read about it here if you want. Long story short, Anheuser\u2019s beloved brand Bud Light collaborated controversially with a social media star. Given the underlying narrative, the move sparked criticism that Bud Light went \u201cwoke.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, the controversy has affected Anheuser-Busch. Not only that, concerns exist that the creative decision will continue to haunt the company. I have a different view: it\u2019s difficult to stay angry for that long, especially for really old news.\n\nAnalysts agree. At the end of 2024, they believe sales will hit $63.4 billion, up nearly 7% from last year\u2019s tally. Also, sales may slow a bit but will still be lofty at $66.27 billion by the end of 2025, per estimates.\n\nOverall, the experts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $76 price target, projecting over 26% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Up 6,800%+ in 5 Years, Celsius Stock (NASDAQ:CELH) Can Still Run",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has comfortably outperformed the stock market over several years. Shares are up by 159% over the past year and have a five-year gain of more than 6,800%.\u00a0CELH stock also jumped 20% after a successful earnings report. The sports beverage company has been gaining market share at a rapid pace, but the stock still looks like an enticing long-term Buy.\n\nI am bullish on Celsius Holdings due to its high revenue growth, double-digit net profit margins, and penetration into international markets.\n\nDomestic Revenue Growth Remains Strong\n\nCelsius Holdings\u2019 main driver is currently domestic (revenue generated in North America) growth. The sports beverage company delivered on this front with 97% year-over-year domestic revenue growth in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Overall sales growth came in at 95% year-over-year.\n\nHigh North America segment revenue growth is the key to strong financials at the moment. However, International segment growth is the company\u2019s long-term opportunity. Celsius Holdings only made $8.7 million in International sales compared to $169.3 million in domestic sales.\n\nThe differences between these revenue numbers demonstrate how little Celsius Holdings has tapped into international markets. Despite being in the early innings, Celsius Holdings achieved 68% year-over-year International sales growth. Given the company\u2019s high domestic sales numbers, Celsius drinks can continue to grow at a robust pace in international markets for several years.\n\nNet Profit Margins Still Remain High\n\nCelsius generated $39.1 million in net income in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s a big turnaround from a $28.2 million net loss in the same period last year. The company\u2019s net income growth resulted in an 11.3% profit margin.\n\nCelsius Holdings has regularly received comparisons to Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). Monster is more established and has successfully penetrated international markets. It also regularly generates net profit margins above 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Celsius is poised to expand its margins as its revenue increases. Consistently reporting net profit margins above 20% will strengthen the stock\u2019s valuation. The stock trades at a\u00a059.2x forward P/E ratio. Further penetration into international markets presents an opportunity for higher profits and a lower P/E ratio.\n\nNot everyone will like the valuation, but it will get better over the years. Investors who can buy this stock with a five-to-10-year horizon will have an easier time overlooking the high valuation and understanding what it can become in the future. Celsius Holdings has always been known for its lofty valuation, but the stock continues to deliver because of its vast potential and impressive financial growth.\n\nWhat Makes Celsius Holdings Different from Other Beverage Companies?\n\nConsumers are seeking healthier foods and beverages, and they are willing to pay higher prices for them. Celsius Holdings plays nicely into this trend, as the drink omits many of the unhealthy ingredients that are traditionally in sports beverages.\n\nCelsius beverages\u00a0do not contain\u00a0sugar, high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, or aspartame. The drink also has seven essential vitamins, accelerates metabolism, and burns body fat and calories.\n\nThe unique value proposition has helped Celsius tap into several markets, such as convenience stores, grocery stores, drug stores, fitness centers, e-commerce platforms, mass market stores, and other retailers.\n\nCelsius has a portfolio of more than 15 beverages and uses stevia to sweeten its drinks. The company also has powder sticks. You can take these with you on the go, add water, and then enjoy a cup of Celsius.\n\nThe product mix has worked well for the company and its investors. As more consumers look for healthier alternatives, Celsius should continue to perform well. The company also has strong brand loyalty among its customers based on consistently high revenue growth. If someone drinks a Celsius beverage, it can quickly turn into a habit.\n\nIs CELH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nCelsius Holdings hasn\u2019t received many price target updates after reporting earnings. Nonetheless, the stock is currently rated as a Strong Buy based on nine Buys and two Hold ratings assigned in the past three months. The average CELH stock price target of $86.55 implies 9.2% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Celsius Holdings Stock\n\nCelsius Holdings is tapping into several tailwinds. Consumers are seeking healthier sports drinks and like how Celsius beverages taste. It\u2019s a good dynamic that has experienced a lot of success in North America. The ongoing international rollout should lead to meaningful revenue growth in future quarters.\n\nAdditionally, International sales were up by 68% year-over-year. While those sales still make up a small number of total sales, Celsius Holdings has many opportunities to expand. The company\u2019s domestic sales are still going strong, and by the time these sales slow down, international growth can take over and present more growth for investors.\n\nOverall, Celsius is positioned to thrive in the long run. CELH has already outpaced most stocks and remains an enticing long-term opportunity, in my view.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 March 1, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA and Celsius Holdings CELH.\n\nThese 3 Companies Posted Record-Breaking Quarters\n\nEarnings season continues to wind down, with the bulk of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\n\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple, NVIDIA and Celsius Holdings.\n\nLet's take a closer look at each.\n\nApple\n\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\n\nStill, EPS wasn't the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\n\nIt's worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises.\n\nShares couldn't hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin.\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA's quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA's Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity.\n\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\n\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year.\n\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong growth.\n\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including those above, have posted quarterly records.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \r\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Paul Wiseman, Investors Relations for Celsius. Thank you may begin.\n\nPaul Wiseman\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are John Fieldly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Langhans, Chief Financial Officer. The call will open to questions following the prepared remarks.\r\nThe company released its fourth quarter earnings press release earlier this morning, and all materials are available on the company's website celsiusholdingsinc.com as well as on the SEC's website, sec.gov. As a reminder, an audio replay of this call will be available later today and can be accessed with the same live webcast link in our conference call announcement released. \r\nPlease be aware that this call may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on forecasts, expectations and other information available to management at this time.

We encourage you to review in full our safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC for additional information.\r\nAdditionally, management will share operating results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures that we use, such as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, and reconciliations of these measures to our results as reported in accordance with GAAP are detailed in our earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2023.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. Also welcome to Paul Wiseman, who recently joined Celsius as our Senior Vice President of Communications. Celsius had a stellar 2023 fourth quarter, the best earnings year in our company's history. We have achieved nearly complete distribution coverage in the United States, topping 98% ACV, which is a major achievement, putting our products in reach of more consumers and more consumption occasions with greater flavors and size options than ever before. In 2023, Celsius set a new yearly revenue record, growing more than 102% or $664 million in sales to finish the year at just over $1.3 billion. Celsius is now truly a $1 billion brand.\r\nOur impressive share gains in 2023 have resulted in Celsius becoming the first company to break the 10-share barrier in more than a decade. According to Circana, IRI's recent 4-week read ending February 11, 2024 in total energy U.S., Celsius held a new record of 11.5 share nationwide in MULOC. The energy drink category is now a 3-team race.\r\nAs of January 2024, Celsius had exceeded a 15 share in over a dozen U.S. markets and a few of those, we are within just a few points of our next closest competitor or have already taken them. Our strong innovation pipeline continues to delight consumers whose taste for zero sugar energy drinks has nearly tripled the overall category sales to a zero sugar majority. Although this year, we have launched 2 new core SKUs, Sparkling Raspberry Peach and Fizz-Free Blue Raspberry Lemonade. In addition, 2 new Celsius Vibe flavors, Astro Vibe and Galaxy Vibe, which has taken our Space Odyssey, truly even further with the launch of our Cosmic Vibe in 2023 in Circle K. \r\nCelsius also launched Celsius Essential's product line, which has proven essential performance energy with essential aminos. We are executing our plans to grow the business internationally, taking a methodical approach in each new market we enter. \r\nWe're very pleased with our sales in Canada after 2 months in the country. Consumer enthusiasm and acceptance has exceeded our expectations. We're pursuing disciplined growth in our best-in-class sales and marketing organizations. And just 2 weeks ago, Celsius was recognized with the 7-Eleven's prestigious 2023 Supplier of the Year award in a nonalcoholic category. This is a tremendous achievement. And I want to thank all our dedicated team members on achieving this great top industry award. Best-in-class teams drive best-in-class results. \r\nWith nearly full distribution, we are focusing on driving growth through 3 areas: increasing total distribution points at each location, growing in nontracked channels and international expansion over the long-term horizon. Celsius was again the top driver of the energy category in dollars and units sold in MULOC, ending in the fourth quarter, up 126.6% and up 140.2% for the full year of 2023, supporting a 30.6% of all the energy category growth for the year.\r\nAlready this year, we've launched several new and exciting innovations as well as a brand update to our line of Fizz-Free beverages, which have a strong and loyal consumer base. A new Fizz-Free multipack available now in Target stores brings together refreshing selection to our consumers who prefer the noncarbonated energy drinks.\r\nSales of Celsius Essentials, our new line of performance-oriented and energy, a 16-ounce beverage products launched in the fourth quarter at 7-Eleven stores across the United States and our 2 new flavors, Sparkling Mango Tango and Sparkling Fruit Burst bring the Celsius Essential line to 6 unique SKUs. As of January 2024, Celsius Essentials has achieved a record 40% ACV year-to-date, February 18th, it's at 49% ACV, continuing to see greater acceptance across retailers across the country. \r\nAlso in January, our Celsius on-the-go powder claimed the position in the energy powder category according to Circana's IRI commanding a 23.1 share, having increased 5.6% compared to the prior period. We have several new on-the-go powder innovations plan for this year and see great opportunities with our [virtual] on-the-go product line.\r\nIn 2024, spring resets began in January and typically run through May. We are very pleased with the incremental space we're gaining, which will be reflected across the first and second quarters of 2024. As a reminder, planograms used for most of 2023 when our dollar sales grew 140% were created while we were holding and held approximately 4.5 share in the category. For 2024, shelf space planning was conducted with retail partners in Q3 of 2023, when we held a digital -- double-digit share position. Celsius is also now fully integrated into PepsiCo's annual planning cycle, and we anticipate ongoing close collaboration with our primary North American distribution partner and expanded key accounts team.\r\nOur pursuit of a perfect store resulted in a 60% increase in display activity across the United States, and we placed more than over 10,000 Celsius branded coolers in 2023 and an increase of over 300% year-over-year. We intend to continue growing our base of branded coolers throughout this year. \r\nNontracked channels continue to be a tailwind for us as well. Club sales for the fourth quarter were $77.1 million, up 64% year-over-year. Club sales for the full year 2023 were $254.6 million, representing an $83.6 million increase year-over-year.\r\nWe achieved the #1 energy drink position on Amazon in 2023, finishing the full year revenue at $101 million, a 72.9% increase year-over-year. Our refreshing great tasting products are ideal for the meal occasion, and today, more than 12.5% of our PepsiCo sales is to the foodservice channel. For example, in 2023, we gained distribution in over 2,000 Jersey Mike stores and are authorized to sell in more than 3,000 Dunkin' Donut locations nationwide. We believe there is incremental growth opportunities for Celsius and nontracked outlets, such as vending, hospitals, corporate cafeterias and college campuses and more.\r\nTurning to international. We began distribution in sales in Canada through Pepsi in mid-January. As we had previously signaled, after approximately 1 month of sales, we are very pleased with the results and even more so to delight our Canadian consumers who have embraced our products.\r\nInternational sales reached $14.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $54.7 million for the full year. \r\nAlso in January, we announced a sales and distribution agreement with Suntory Beverage for Great Britain and Ireland. We expect sales in the United Kingdom to begin gradually starting in the Finnish channel in the second quarter. \r\nWe expect additional international expansion this year. And as previously stated, we're taking a methodical approach to our international growth, and we will be following our international growth playbook in each new market we enter.\r\nBefore I hand it over to Jarrod to discuss financial highlights for the quarter and the full year, we have several exciting marketing developments and achievements to be proud of. Celsius recently announced a renewed multiyear global team sponsorship with Formula One's iconic Ferrari racing team. Major League soccer kicked off its regular season last week, and Celsius is a proud league partner as well as key sponsor of multiple teams and players across the United States and Canada. These strategic investments placed our premium brand in the forefront of consumers who share our passion to live fit.\r\nWith that, I'll pass it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jarrod Langhans, to discuss our fourth quarter and 2023 full year financial results. Jarrod?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nThanks, John. It was another great quarter in which we continue to exceed both internal and external expectations. Not only are we continuing to benefit from Pepsi's distribution system, but we're also delivering on increased SKU count, improved placement, increased displays and continuous improvement within velocities. As we look to Q1 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our growth. \r\nTurning to our fourth quarter financial highlights. Revenue for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $347 million, an increase of 95% from $178 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2022. Driven by our North American business, where fourth quarter revenues were $333 million, an increase of 97% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 68% to $15 million as velocity continued to increase. As it relates to days on hand with our primary distributor, our inventory turns relative to depletions was consistent with our Q3 2023 turnover.\r\nWe attribute our sales volume growth for the quarter compared to 2022 to several key drivers, including successful integration into the Pepsi distribution system, which has resulted in broader availability, increased SKU mix, and improved placement. We're also benefiting from robust expansion in our traditional distribution channels and club channels with SKU increases in placement improvements contributing significantly. Moreover, our products are now found in several new channels within CNG and foodservice.\r\nGross profit for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, increased 110% to $166 million, up from $79 million in the year ago quarter. Gross profit margins in the fourth quarter were approximately 48% of revenues compared to approximately 44% for the prior year fourth quarter. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to efficiencies in raw material sourcing product-based reduction and benefits from improved leverage across promotional allowances. Q4 was the fifth consecutive quarter that we were operating within the Pepsi distribution system, and we expect to continue driving efficiencies while maintaining our #1 goal of keeping the shelf stock to meet strong consumer demand.\r\nSales and marketing expenses for the quarter were approximately $80 million, a decrease of approximately 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was due to prior year costs associated with the termination of legacy distributors as part of the transition to the Pepsi network. \r\nWe continue to invest behind our growth in Q4, incurring sales and marketing costs in line with historical rates. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 23% compared to 29% in the prior year adjusted for distributor termination expenses in 2022. We plan to continue investment in our sales and marketing and plan a similar spend as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2024.\r\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, were approximately $27 million, an increase of 24% relative to Q4 2022. As a percentage of sales, G&A was 8% compared to 12% in the prior year as we continue to leverage our G&A against our significant growth. And looking back at prior periods, even with our historical growth rates, we do tend to see some seasonality within the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. We saw similar activities in the fourth quarter, whereby we are not able to capitalize on the great work from our sales and marketing teams as it relates to displays on hand and other promotional activities that we are able to take advantage of during the summer selling season. Even with this, we ended the year strong and have since well exceeded the 10 share marker as noted by John earlier in the call.\r\nLooking at the full year 2023. As you will see in the 10-K issued this morning, we made great progress in our remediation efforts around our internal control environment. We were successful in remediating the prior period controls associated with IT general controls as well as creating and delivering a much more robust [coastal] environment. Although we made huge strides in 2023, there are still a handful of areas where components of larger areas of the control environment needs some additional time to fully remediate.\r\nWith that said, I'd like to thank the entire Celsius team for the great effort and in particular, our finance and IT teams for their focus and dedication to this matter in 2023. I look forward to our continued progress in 2024. \r\nNow to the results. Revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $1.3 billion an increase of 102% from $654 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, driven by our North American business. North America full year 2023 revenues were $1.27 billion, an increase of 105% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 52% to $55 million in 2023 relative to full year 2022. \r\nGross profit for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, increased 134% to $633 million, up from $271 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margins in the full year of 2023 were approximately 48% of revenues compared to approximately 41% for the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to lower package and raw material costs. \r\nAs things stand today, we would expect 2024 gross profit margins to be fairly consistent with the Q4 and full year margin profile, as we are confident in maintaining the great progress that was made in 2023. We are always shooting for the moon but with the uncertainty around the macro environment from both an operational and promotional perspective, we believe that it is prudent to give ourselves some additional time into 2024.\r\nAs a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 20% in the 12 months of 2023 compared to 24% in the prior year same period, adjusted for distributor termination expenses. This demonstrated the leverage that we can obtain within our sales and marketing costs. \r\nWe made great progress in 2023, but we are now moving to the next level and the next target beyond 10% market share. And to do that, we will need to continue to invest in our growth and our brand, as seen with the multiple Super Bowl activations that we did in February, our recently announced multiyear partnership with Ferrari within Formula One as well as our multiyear MLS partnership.\r\nG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 8% for the 12 months of 2023 versus 12% in the prior year same period. We will continue to invest in our back shop and build out a team that is value-added to our operations, sales and marketing programs. There will be opportunity to further leverage G&A in 2024 and beyond, but it will be at a thoughtful and methodical pace. \r\nFocusing now on liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash in excess of $755 million and net working capital in excess of $928 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled in excess of $140 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, which compares to $108 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. \r\nWe will continue to invest in our business (technical difficulty).\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\n\nMark Stiefel Astrachan\n\nTwo questions for me. One, just on gross margin, maybe talk a little bit about why it stepped back in 4Q relative to 3Q, even after adjusting for the promotional allowance accrual last quarter, meaning I would have expected to see a little bit better. Was there some sort of one-offs in that number? And how do we think about progression of that into '24? \r\nAnd then the second question, I appreciate the commentary on inventories from a channel standpoint with your largest customer. But if I take a look at what the sales look like in the [scanner] data track channels in addition to what you disclosed in the regulatory filings on Amazon and Costco sales, I still get a fairly big disconnect between what it looks like you should have sold in the quarter and what you actually did, meaning that you undershipped somewhere in the channel. So maybe you could help with that, too.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Thank you, Mark. I'll join in on the first part of the question, and I'll throw it over to Jarrod as well. I think when you look at the overall margins, I think we're really pleased with the margins, especially for the full year, up over 660 basis points. Just a phenomenal job on behalf of the team on supply chain and our key accounts team. We're maintaining a pricing promotional architecture within the category.\r\nWhen you look at the, really the fourth quarter, we did launch a new line, our Celsius Essentials line, which are the 16-ounce line, and we had a variety of innovational launches that were executed during the quarter. So I think we're pretty pleased with where the margins came in, and there's opportunities to improve going forward. But at this point in time, I think that's a -- team did a really good job for the year. \r\nAnd in regards to inventory by channel, we did have some seasonal impact in Q4 that we did experience. We did have good results on Amazon and within the club channel, but we did see especially impacted mainly in food and really large format. A lot of our volume, we've done a great job on half of our distribution partner as well, really keeping the amount of cases on display up. We're still gaining -- we hope to gain additional placements and additional expansion in the upcoming sets that are being reset. But we do rely heavily, especially in large format on display activity. And when you look at the fourth quarter, we do see a lot of display activity coming from seasonal items that we're competing with outside of the summer or the rest of the year. So those are some headwinds we experienced in the fourth quarter, but I'll throw it over to Jarrod for any additional highlights.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nNo, you're right, John. It's -- when we're looking at kind of just more of a days-on-hand perspective with our largest distributor, we did have the innovations that we filled the pipe with that would offset, I would say maybe some reductions you're talking about, Mark. But on a net-net basis, the days on hand in total for us was in good shape. And to John's point, the Q4 tends to be a little bit pressured just because of the inventory on hand across our retail customers and our mass and grocery customers.\n\nMark Stiefel Astrachan\n\nGot it. Maybe just one follow-up then. If we think about the innovation in your comments you just made about the net-net kind of equaling out. It sounds like you're saying that the innovation offset the legacy products. Is that the case as you think about the shelf resets and incremental distribution, meaning it can't be a 1:1, so you're going to add more space. So why wouldn't the Pepsi system take more of the products, meaning taking innovation plus the legacy because you've got to backfill the legacy sales?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I think when we looked at our #1 customer, we look at their inventory levels, they're fairly consistent with Q3 to Q4. So even though we did take some innovation on. So it's -- I think if we look at the scan data, we had really strong scan data in the fourth quarter, and it's -- we'll see how this continues to evolve.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes, it's a good question, Mark. I think, we can just tell you where we were as of 12/31 and on a net-net basis, in total, our days on hand were consistent and in good shape. And as we got to January, we started rolling out all of the innovation that you can see all across the U.S., and it's been very successful and being very good and it has been incremental thus far.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.\n\nPeter K. Grom\n\nSo I was hoping to get some perspective on how you're thinking about the market share trajectory from here. Obviously, things sort of leveled out towards the latter portion of '23, but we've actually seen some nice improvement to start the year. Maybe just to start, is the improvement we've seen year-to-date, largely a function of kind of that innovation you touched on rather than shelf resets. And then I guess with more resets to come, how would you think investors should think about the share trajectory as we look out to March and into the spring. Jarrod, you mentioned that you've now surpassed 10%. You're now focusing on a new target. So just any color on what that new target might be from a share perspective.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. No. Thank you, Peter. I mean we're not going to give any forward guidance on the future share, but we do look at the current trajectories and where we are currently at within different category -- within a variety of segments and the categories. And you mentioned Amazon. We disclosed Amazon. We're close to a 20 share within the energy category on Amazon. And then -- if you also look at -- I mentioned in my script, we have 12 key markets that we're tracking ahead of 15 share within the category and that's MULOC data. So there is a good trajectory there.\r\nI think the biggest opportunity for us when you look at it is really in convenience. And we've built this brand going through the variety of channels. And the last -- the biggest opportunity is in convenience, where you about 56% 57% of all sales are sold. \r\nSo that's where we anticipate the biggest resets to take place. In the coming resets, right now, in the convenience channel, we are just at a 10 share. So we're really excited about the opportunities you have there versus if you just look at the food category, we're roughly around a 16 share within the energy category. \r\nSo those are some recent data points that we have that, that we've shared within the script as well as in the earnings release. And we've talked before, we're somewhere between the average, as Jarrod mentioned, we're about we closed at about a 10 share, and we're on close to a 20 share within Amazon. So we're working hard. The team is working hard and we're executing, and that doesn't include the new 16-ounce Essentials line, which is just getting started this year, which we're excited about.\n\nPeter K. Grom\n\nNo, that's really helpful. And then I guess just on follow-up just on international. Can you maybe help us understand how we should think about the contribution from a revenue perspective. Are you exploring any additional markets for this year? Or would anything else kind of be more of a '25 narrative? And then just within that, I'm sure a lot of people and you've gotten this question a lot, but just, maybe explain why Suntory was the distributor of choice for the U.K. and Ireland?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Thank you, Peter. I think number one, when we look at international expansion, we just went into Canada. We talked about that into -- on the script. We're really excited on the consumer acceptance. We're also excited about the -- we're in 7-Eleven in Couche-Tard. It's product is doing really well, and we're expanding. So our partner is excited. Canada should be a big market. U.K., did announce Suntory for our partner there. They -- we're looking for the best partners to align with on our go-to-market strategy. One thing that was very attractive about Suntory is their access to the gym community. \r\nAnd we're really focused on a methodical approach as we expand and grow, really about building awareness, trial, that foundational base of loyalty and then scaling. So as we look to see the size and the timing and sequencing of international, I think that's -- we'll know that as we go through these markets and expand in these markets. And how quickly we are accepted, we can move as fast as we can. But we want to be very cognizant on entering new markets through a methodical approach about building that loyal foundation before we go and overall scale. So those are the comments there in regards, and we're really excited about our partnership with Suntory.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\n\nMichael Scott Lavery\n\nYou touched on unmeasured channels as one of your big opportunities and gave some examples, corporate cafeterias, universities vending. There's lots of physical distribution points under all that. And I just would love to get a sense of how we should think about how quickly -- how close to hand those are? How quickly those could ramp up, kind of what the trajectory might look like for momentum in those areas?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I think everyone is really excited about that. When you look at our PepsiCo revenues, over 12% is coming from really the foodservice. Internally here, we think there's a big opportunity there. We see that Celsius is much broader opportunity when you look at the TAM versus, say, traditional energy, we're seeing consumers -- consumer consumption increase outside of that energy need state. We're seeing the product being paired with sandwiches and smoothies and bowls and a variety of opportunities for fast casual. \r\nSo I think it's a little bit too early for us to really know how big that opportunity is. We have a -- we'll probably know over the next 12 to 24 months as we further expand in some additional quick service as well as expand in additional foodservice accounts and then universities and hospitals as well is a huge opportunity for us. Not able to quantify that at this time, but we do see it as big opportunity.\n\nMichael Scott Lavery\n\nOkay. And just on the Canada, U.K., Ireland launches, as we think about margins for 2024, obviously, you'd spend ahead of really ramping those revenues. And so all else equal, should we expect a dip in EBITDA margins for -- or EBIT margins for 2024 versus 2023? Or can you just give us a sense of how to think about the spending or what's in your plans for how that looks?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I'll turn that over to Jarrod for additional comments.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes. So they're going to be a little different. Canada where most of the population is, I think, within 80 miles of the U.S. border and also being so close. We actually already had a co-packer in Canada that we were using as a backup for our U.S. business. So that rollout and that growth, we think, will be at a different trajectory than the U.K., which we're kind of launching from 0. So there will be investment in both markets as we build brand awareness and as we really build out the system. We won't have the same scale and leverage advantages within the manufacturing as we do in the U.S. So there is going to be some costs and some investment there. But it will be, let's call it -- it's not going to be a significant component of either our growth or our cost infrastructure this year. So we do believe that the numbers that we discussed on our prepared remarks, we'll be able to handle those investments as well.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. And I'll just -- in regards to -- when you look at it, Michael, one thing we've noticed is the brand awareness, even though we're not in the U.K., there is an underlying brand awareness just associated with -- the world is really so small these days, a one click away. So a lot of our influencers and social media activations are actually being picked up with our potential consumers in the U.K. So we had a little bit -- we have more brand awareness than we actually had initially anticipated based on our research. So we're excited, we think it's going to be a great market for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities.\n\nGerald John Pascarelli\n\nGreat. Just one on gross margin. Another quarter in the high 40s here. But in the energy category, you've already had a larger competitor take a rate increase. There's sentiment that your larger competitor will ultimately follow suit. So in the event this happens, how do you think about managing your price gaps relative to peers? I guess, just curious on your thoughts around a potential rate increase this year as that would obviously imply upside to your high 40s margin target? Any color there would be great.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Thank you, Gerald. There's opportunities. We want to be a premium-priced product. I think if you look at it per ounce basis, we feel we're very competitively priced. There's a variety of different levers than just taking frontline pricing. So we have our pricing promotional strategies that we utilize as well. We just -- we're launching a new line extension as well with our Celsius Essential 16-ounce. And then you also -- you have your pricing architecture by channel as well so in pack size. \r\nSo there's ways to navigate that. I think we're very pleased with the way we finished the year with margins and we're really focused on driving share and revenue growth and continue to drive consumer consumption and ultimately, that daily consumption we're looking for. And we're just really getting started here. When you look at just now a 10 share in the energy category in convenience. So there's a long runway ahead. But it's something we watch closely. At this point, we're not going to make any comments on future any price increases at this time.\n\nGerald John Pascarelli\n\nUnderstood. Just one more for me. I think your nonmeasured channel revenue came in a little better than expected, specifically related to Amazon at least what we were modeling for. In a lower seasonal quarter, your 4Q absolute revenue is almost in line with your second quarter, which obviously benefited from Prime Day. So any incremental color on the drivers in the quarter within that channel would be helpful if you could provide any.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I mean Amazon, we had a great -- in the quarter, it was a great period. And there is a lot of timing as well within shipments and how the Amazon kind of controls or feeds inventory through their warehouses based on their algorithms. So we're going to keep shipping them. We're going to -- we're #1 energy drink right now, roughly about a 20 share in the energy category. I don't really have much color than that, but continue to drive further revenues through that channel. It is an omnichannel world, and that's something we really focus here at Celsius. We want to deliver Celsius to consumers when they want it, how they want it.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nI think it does show too, that there is still opportunity for continued growth within the Amazon channel. So it's not necessarily slowing down suddenly just because we got to a certain spot within that. So I do see that as a continued growth opportunity for us as we look out into 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sean McGowan with ROTH Capital Partners.\n\nSean Patrick McGowan\n\nA couple of quickies here. On the sales and marketing, give some good color on what we expect in the first quarter. And I think that rate of 23% is a little higher than you had talked about for some periods in the past. Is that a good number to use for the full year of '24?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nI think I referred to Q1 and Q4 in my prepared remarks. And if you look at our Q1 activations and activity, we've got the Super Bowl activations we did that that we believe were very successful. We've actually got a Jake Paul fight this weekend down in Puerto Rico with another number of influencers that we support. We kicked off the MLS last week or a couple of weeks ago. We kicked off the F1 partnership. So we've got a number of things that are really rolling in Q1 to keep the momentum going. \r\nAs we look at a full year basis, historically, we've been in the 22% to 24% range. We were at 20% on a year-to-date basis in 2023. I think those are kind of the data points to stick to. If we've got opportunity to invest ahead of growth, we're going to continue to invest it. We're going to spend our money wisely. John and I require an ROI on everything we do. So we're not going to spend foolishly. But if we see opportunity to push growth, we'll push growth, if we don't see it, we'll continue to lever.\n\nSean Patrick McGowan\n\nOkay. And then on the Essentials line, could you give us, I mean, that's pretty rapid acceleration of ACV. Where do you think that goes? And basically, more generally, what is the plan for additional SKUs and additional outlets for that line. I'm seeing it in its own cooler or a separate cooler in some stores. Do you think this can double that? Can you get to a 80% plus ACV by the end of the year?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nThat's -- well, we've never launched a new line with our new distribution partner, PepsiCo. So I think we have a lot to learn. We are working hard. We think it can definitely be incremental. There is a lot of opportunity in there. That 16-ounce Celsius Essentials has been really well recepted by consumers. What's great? It's not cannibalizing existing sales. So we are bringing in additional new consumers and converting new consumers into the Celsius portfolio. So that has us really excited. It's not -- we're not trading our existing consumers. So the initial data.\r\nIt's still early. When you look at it, you're only talking like 8 weeks, 12 weeks of data we have at best in certain stores. So we really need to get a little bit more data underneath our belts as we move into -- get through Q1 and most importantly, see what these resets bring that are coming out. So I think this summer, we'll have a better read on how this portfolio is going to perform the Celsius Essential line within our overall global portfolio.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes. It's a great product. You should get out and taste it, if you haven't yet.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nIt tastes great.\n\nSean Patrick McGowan\n\nI have some in my office.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley.\n\nEric Adam Serotta\n\nGreat. So could you give a little bit more granularity as to what drove the step-up in Pepsi revenue through the foodservice channel? I think it had been running at 10%, now it's at 12.5%. I think Jersey Mikes and Dunkin' are still very early days, and I'm not sure if those go through Pepsi, so maybe you could clarify that. But what specific channels are you seeing traction in, in foodservice through Pepsi? \r\nAnd then a broader question, in terms of the new SKUs that you're adding, particularly on the Vibes and the core flavors, what are you seeing in terms of incrementality there? How are the sort of legacy flavors and by legacy core and Vibes flavors performing as you're introducing these new SKUs? And then sort of what do you see as the limit for SKU count or flavor variety here, you're still a long way from Monster and Red Bull?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nI'll start with the foodservice one. John can have the -- all the other ones. So foodservice, I look at that as just continued momentum. I mean, if you look at our club program, once we start launching with them, we've got good progress, good momentum, but then you really see the volumes and velocity is growing. We're seeing the same thing across foodservice. We also had the college program fully in place in Q4. So as we talked about last quarter over the summer season, it tends to die down a bit when the college campus is empty out. \r\nWe're also seeing great progress in the other channels within foodservice that we're in. You mentioned, Mikes, you mentioned Dunkin', there's also hospitals. There's a variety of other food establishments. And so we're just continuing to see ongoing momentum across that channel, and we're really seeing that grow and be built out. And our distributor has really been helping significantly with that. So continued momentum, and we're doing great there. But let me throw the other ones over to John.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. And just a further detail on that. I think we're also seeing great momentum. And you talked about the step up and Jarrod, you mentioned college universities as a big opportunity and seeing growth there. But also vending. Keep in mind, vending is also going through that foodservice and the vending, we've expanded in vending. We're seeing great results in vending. \r\nAnd at-work micro markets, we talked about those prior on several calls prior. The at-work micro-market opportunity is really good. I mean you see a lot of opportunities at work locations. So you're seeing the product continuing to scale. And I agree with you, Eric. I think seeing that go from 10% to 12%, just shows you the growth opportunity we have on an overall basis in this nontracked channel opportunity. \r\nLooking at new SKUs, the Vibe line, we're excited about the Vibe line, talk about the success we had, I mentioned on the comments on the call earlier that Cosmic Vibe, we launched at Circle K and really going intergalactic with the theme of Space -- the Space Odyssey with our 2 new Vibe flavors to have a Space team. We're really excited on rolling that out. We're going to have some events coming up at Coachella and a variety of neat things to -- that you, guys, will be able to see. \r\nThe Vibe line is going to be a totally separate line. We're going to scale and grow that. I think there's a lot of opportunities to bring out innovative flavors and experiences with every sip. And then our core flavors, the team continues to come out with great flavors. I mean, you look at core, even expanding the core into our no Fizz line as well, where there's Blue Raspberry Lemonade that we launched at 7-Eleven in Q1 has been phenomenal. I mean the product tastes great and really expands this non-Fizz or non-carb opportunity that could be in wholly another revenue stream and ultimately an extension of our portfolio as well. \r\nSo we're monitoring the SKUs. Obviously, you need to do SKU rationalization. So that's something we talk internally at innovation meetings. We'll be doing that each year. We want to -- we'll cut our, as I call it, our tail or slow-moving SKUs. But we do see consumers looking for new innovation and staying within our portfolio, which is great. So our new Sparkling Peach, Raspberry Peach is phenomenal, great flavor. Eric, try it, please go out and try it. I think you'll enjoy as much as we do.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens.\n\nJames Ronald Salera\n\nI wanted to drill down a little bit on the coolers because I have been in Cleveland, Ohio, and I was very surprised to see a Celsius branded cooler very prominently displayed at the cash wrap of the local grocerier. And so can you just talk about kind of the channel strategy there? How you want to get those coolers placed? And then maybe as a part 2 to that question, just any color you can offer on incremental uplift, velocity, repeat rates, trial buys in locations that do have the branded fridges?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Jim, it's a big, big initiative we've had over the years trying to get more cooler placement. If you've been tracking the company over the years, we've been historically sold warm. So we had to build a loyal consumer that would actually have to take the product home and chill it and then drink of the daily lifestyle and routine. And that really shows to the loyalty around the Celsius consumer. \r\nCold availability is key to the success in order to compete in the energy category, especially with the impulse purchases. That is the biggest opportunity for us, and kind of mentioning it prior to the question, when we look at the convenience channel, that impulse purchase is key to the success of where we want to go and who we want to be in the category. \r\nSo we have -- we placed about 10,000 coolers. We are investing in more coolers. We're working on placing more coolers. We want to be right at checkout. Eye-level is critical. We're talking to a variety of retailers as well, to gain additional checkout coolers. So I think that's a big opportunity. Most recently down in South Florida, if you look at Publix, we've gained checkout coolers, and we're looking to gain additional checkout coolers on the next reset. \r\nSo that's a big opportunity. We do see uplift. If you're by the register and you're cold, kind of the saying we say internally here, if it's cold, it's sold. So the other thing is stacking high and watch it fly. Some comments we make around displays. But definitely a lift, the exact lift is hard to say because each channel and each store in each region is quite different on the velocity levels, but there is a substantial lift.\n\nJames Ronald Salera\n\nOkay. Great. And maybe one follow-up on that. Are all of the actual use in the cooler consistent across the portfolio? Or do you guys make changes on that based on channel, local geography? Like could we see a Celsius lines in there? Or some of the other product innovations show up in the coolers?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. That's a great question. So we do have planograms and progressions we work on based on the size of the cooler. There is a little bit of regional seasonality that based on a retailer, we do exclusive flavors. So like at Circle K, we did our Cosmic Vibe. I talked about 7-Eleven, the new launch with the Raspberry Lemonade so -- Fizz-Free. \r\nSo you will see potentially unique flavors and given coolers, but we do have a standard national planogram that's being followed, probably not always followed to the tea, but that is something we work on as an overall organization and work with our PepsiCo partners to keep the progressions in the coolers in accordance to our planogram.\r\nSo the core should be have its own planogram, the Vibe should have a planogram and also our Fizz-Free line should have a planogram as well as our Celsius Essentials 16-ounce. So that's kind of how our go-to-market strategy.\n\nOperator\n\nThat's all the time we have for questions.

        "title": "Decoding Celsius Holdings Inc (CELH): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Strengths highlight Celsius Holdings Inc's innovative product offerings and strategic partnerships. Weaknesses underscore the challenges of dependency on key distributors and raw material availability. Opportunities emphasize the potential for market expansion and product line diversification. Threats include regulatory risks and intense competition in the functional beverage industry.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with CELH.\n\nOn February 29, 2024, Celsius Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CELH) filed its 10-K report, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial health and strategic positioning. The company, known for its functional energy drinks, continues to make strides in the beverage market, with a significant 94% revenue concentration in North America. Celsius Holdings Inc's financial tables reveal a robust performance, with a notable forward stock split reflecting investor confidence. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the filing, offering investors a nuanced perspective on the company's potential. Decoding Celsius Holdings Inc (CELH): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nBrand Innovation and Market Appeal: Celsius Holdings Inc's core strength lies in its innovative product lines, such as CELSIUS Originals, Vibe, and the newly introduced CELSIUS ESSENTIALS. These offerings cater to a diverse consumer base, particularly fitness enthusiasts, by combining nutritional science with mainstream beverage appeal. The proprietary MetaPlus formulation, free from aspartame and high fructose corn syrup, positions the company as a leader in the health-conscious segment of the energy drink market.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Distribution: The 20-year distribution agreement with PepsiCo, which holds an 8.5% stake in Celsius Holdings Inc, is a testament to the company's strategic acumen. This partnership not only bolsters the company's distribution capabilities but also enhances its market reach. The expansion of this relationship into Canada and the new agreement with Suntory Beverage & Food in the UK further solidify the company's international presence and growth trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Key Distributors: A significant weakness for Celsius Holdings Inc is its reliance on PepsiCo for distribution, with sales to Pepsi constituting 59.4% of total net revenue. This concentration risks the company's operational stability should any disagreements or terminations arise. The company's financial health is closely tied to this relationship, as evidenced by receivables from Pepsi representing 69.0% of total receivables as of December 31, 2023.\n\nSupply Chain Vulnerabilities: The company has faced challenges with raw material shortages, particularly aluminum cans, which are crucial for product packaging. Such shortages can disrupt production and affect financial performance. Additionally, the company's reliance on third-party manufacturing and distribution exposes it to potential inefficiencies and quality control issues that could impact its brand reputation and customer satisfaction.\n\nOpportunities\n\nMarket Expansion: Celsius Holdings Inc's recent international agreements pave the way for expansion into new markets, such as the UK and Ireland. The company's ability to adapt and cater to diverse consumer preferences across different regions presents a significant opportunity for growth and increased market share.\n\nProduct Line Diversification: The introduction of the CELSIUS Essentials line demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and meeting evolving consumer demands. Continued investment in product development, particularly in the health and wellness segment, can lead to a broader product portfolio and attract new customer segments.\n\nThreats\n\nRegulatory Risks: The functional beverage industry is subject to stringent regulations by bodies such as the FDA and FTC. Any adverse actions or changes in regulations could impact Celsius Holdings Inc's operations, from product composition to marketing strategies. The company must navigate these regulatory landscapes carefully to avoid potential fines, recalls, or reputational damage.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: The energy drink market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for consumer attention. Celsius Holdings Inc must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to maintain its competitive edge. The company also faces the threat of private-label brands from consolidated retailers, which could exert downward pricing pressure and erode profit margins.\n\nIn conclusion, Celsius Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CELH) exhibits a strong foundation with its innovative product lines and strategic partnerships, particularly with PepsiCo. However, the company's heavy reliance on key distributors and potential supply chain disruptions represent vulnerabilities that require careful management. Opportunities for market expansion and product diversification are promising, but regulatory challenges and a competitive landscape pose significant threats. Overall, Celsius Holdings Inc's strategic direction and financial prudence will be critical in leveraging its strengths and opportunities while mitigating its weaknesses and threats.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The stock edged higher around that time, but on featherweight volumes.

The companies had to issue corrections, and the changes in some cases sent shares swinging.\n\nAnd, this week, Cava Group Inc. released its own fourth quarter results a day early after a news outlet published a story on their earnings Monday afternoon. Cava had been scheduled to report results Tuesday after market close.\n\nOf course, even if investors did see Celsius\u2019s report when it became available Wednesday night, they may not have been able to trade on it at the time and would\u2019ve waited until Thursday\u2019s premarket session, said Kenneth Polcari, chief market strategist at Slatestone Wealth LLC.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just sloppy,\u201d Polcari said of the early release. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anyone was disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nRegulators do not often consider honest mistakes made by companies to be securities fraud.

        "title": "These 3 Companies Posted Record-Breaking Quarters",
        "content": "Earnings season continues to wind down, with the bulk of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector\u2019s strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\n\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA, and Celsius Holdings CELH.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each.\n\nApple\n\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\n\nStill, EPS wasn\u2019t the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares couldn\u2019t hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s top line trajectory is visibly bullish, as shown below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA\u2019s Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\n\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\n\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector\u2019s strong growth.\n\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA, and Celsius Holdings CELH, have posted quarterly records.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Why Is Celsius (CELH) Stock Rocketing Higher Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of energy drink company Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) jumped 14% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results that blew past analysts' revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations. Notably, topline growth was strong as revenue grew 95% year on year, driven mostly by North American revenue (up 97% year on year). Management noted that the North American business was led by expansion in distribution points and higher SKUs per location. International revenue also came in strong, up 685% year on year. This was driven by new flavor launches, product availability, and increased velocity. As a result, the gross margin improved significantly (up 110% y/y) and contributed significantly to the EBITDA beat. On the other hand, its EPS narrowly missed analysts' expectations. Zooming out, this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing that the company is staying on track.\n\nIs now the time to buy Celsius? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCelsius's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 25 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Celsius and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was about a month ago, when the company dropped 7.6% on the news that Bank of America analyst Jonathan Keypour downgraded the stock's rating from Buy to Neutral. The analyst cited the potential for increased competition as the company tries to expand product visibility via shelf expansion. He added, \"We still see strong sales and EBITDA potential, but wait for stronger velocity to signal a resumption of momentum in market share gains.\"\n\nCelsius is up 36.9% since the beginning of the year.Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Celsius's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $68,081.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "content": "For the quarter ended December 2023, Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) reported revenue of $347.44 million, up 95.2% over the same period last year. EPS came in at $0.17, compared to $0.01 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue compares to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $326.55 million, representing a surprise of +6.40%. The company delivered an EPS surprise of +6.25%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $0.16.\n\nWhile investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Celsius Holdings Inc. performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGeographic Revenues- North America: $332.80 million versus $317.59 million estimated by four analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +96.6% change. Geographic Revenues- Europe: $12.12 million versus the three-analyst average estimate of $13.49 million.

        "title": "Celsius's (NASDAQ:CELH) Q4 Sales Beat Estimates",
        "content": "Celsius's (NASDAQ:CELH) Q4 Sales Beat Estimates\n\nEnergy drink company Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) announced better-than-expected results in Q4 FY2023, with revenue up 95.2% year on year to $347.4 million. It made a GAAP profit of $0.17 per share, improving from its loss of $0.09 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Celsius? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nCelsius (CELH) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $347.4 million vs analyst estimates of $331.5 million (4.8% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $65.2 million vs analyst estimates of $58.4 million (11.6% beat) EPS: $0.17 vs analyst expectations of $0.18 (6.5% miss) Gross Margin (GAAP): 47.8%, up from 44.4% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $15.7 billion\n\nWith its proprietary MetaPlus formula as the basis for key products, Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) offers energy drinks that feature natural ingredients to help in fitness and weight management.\n\nBeverages and Alcohol\n\nThese companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the explosion of alcoholic craft beer drinks or the steady decline of non-alcoholic sugary sodas. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.\n\nSales Growth\n\nCelsius is a small consumer staples company, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefitting from better brand awareness and economies of scale. On the other hand, one advantage is that its growth rates can be higher because it's growing off a small base.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 116% over the last three years was incredible for a consumer staples business.\n\nStory continues Celsius Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Celsius reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 95.2%, and its $347.4 million in revenue beat Wall Street's estimates by 4.8%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 37.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability accounting for key expenses such as marketing and advertising, IT systems, wages, and other administrative costs.\n\nThis quarter, Celsius generated an operating profit margin of 17%, up 35.4 percentage points year on year. This increase was encouraging, and we can infer Celsius was more efficient with its expenses because its operating margin expanded more than its gross margin. Celsius Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nZooming out, Celsius was profitable over the last two years but held back by its large expense base. It's demonstrated mediocre profitability for a consumer staples business, producing an average operating margin of 5.5%. However, Celsius's margin has improved by 44.4 percentage points on average over the last year, an encouraging sign for shareholders. The tide could be turning.\n\nKey Takeaways from Celsius's Q4 Results\n\nWe were impressed by how significantly Celsius blew past analysts' revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS missed analysts' expectations. Zooming out, we think this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing that the company is staying on track. The market was likely expecting more, and the stock is down 1.9% after reporting, trading at $66.42 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Celsius right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.",

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Celsius Holdings Inc. Mixed.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.20 on $380.15 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.95 on $1.81 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

        "content": "Celsius (CELH) Reports Earnings Tomorrow. What To Expect\n\nEnergy drink company Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) will be reporting results tomorrow before market hours. Here's what to look for.\n\nLast quarter Celsius reported revenues of $384.8 million, up 104% year on year, beating analyst revenue expectations by 9.4%. It was an incredible quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nIs Celsius buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Celsius's revenue to grow 86.2% year on year to $331.5 million, improving on the 70.7% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.18 per share. Celsius Total Revenue\n\nMajority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last thirty days, suggesting they are expecting the business to stay the course heading into the earnings. The company only missed Wall St's revenue estimates once over the last two years, and has on average exceeded top line expectations by 11.6%.\n\nLooking at Celsius's peers in the beverages and alcohol segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. Molson Coors delivered top-line growth of 6.1% year on year, beating analyst estimates by 0.4% and Zevia PBC reported revenues up 6.9% year on year, exceeding estimates by 1.2%. Molson Coors traded flat on the results, and\u00a0Zevia was down 1.9%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Molson Coors's results here and Zevia PBC's results here.\n\nInvestors in the beverages and alcohol segment have had steady hands going into the earnings, with the stocks up on average 1.9% over the last month. Celsius is up 33.5% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $69.4, compared to share price of $67.9.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

        "content": "A big rally from\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has re-excited many investors. Many stocks are up for the year alongside the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. This looks like a good year so far after a strong 2023.\n\nEven though numerous stocks are up for the year, the rally for some equities is just getting started. Some stocks look poised to leap 50% higher from current levels due to strong earnings and enticing growth prospects.\n\nThese are some of the bull market stocks to consider as investors start to feel optimistic about the stock market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthier sports drinks than the competition. The company removes many unhealthy ingredients that are common in many beverages. Celsius Holdings\u2019 focus on health is attracting younger generations and rapidly expanding its market share.\n\nShares are up by 112% over the past year and gained 5,230% over the past five years. The stock would have to reach roughly $100/share to experience a 50% gain, and that growth is possible for the firm.\n\nCelsius Holdings is touted as the next\u00a0Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), which has surprisingly outperformed every stock over the past 30 years. That\u2019s right, a beverage company beat out all of the innovative tech giants.\n\nCelsius Holdings isn\u2019t going to experience the same returns as someone who bought and held MNST stock for 30 years. However, the company can generate meaningful returns for investors thanks to high revenue and earnings growth rates.\n\nRevenue increased by 104% year-over-year in\u00a0Q3 2023, while net income jumped by 146% year-over-year. Net profit margins exceeded 20%.\n\nAll of the revenue and earnings growth is coming from domestic sales. That\u2019s the most exciting part about this stock. Celsius Holdings is just starting to penetrate European markets. Once it gets a good foothold in that continent, it can then set its sights on Asia. Celsius Holdings is a domestic winner and has vast potential as it taps into global markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) would have to get to roughly $300/share to complete a 50% leap from current prices. Momentum and financials are both on this company\u2019s side. Shares are up by 171% over the past year and have gained 2,361% over the past five years. Despite the big rally, the stock only trades at a 57-forward P/E ratio.\n\nI use the word \u201conly\u201d because revenue and earnings growth have accelerated. The company increased net sales by 85% year-over-year in the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal 2024 while gaining 305 basis points of market share. Net income increased by 40.7% year-over-year, prompting the company to raise its fiscal 2024 outlook.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty is known for beating estimates, growing at a fast pace and improving profit margins. The company\u2019s beauty products are also well-known, especially among Gen Z. The beauty firm does not use the unethical ingredients more common in other beauty products. It has achieved 20 consecutive quarters of sales growth, and the company is poised to extend that streak.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia is a momentum stock that has crushed expectations and actually lives up to the hype. Shares are up by 234% over the past year and have gained 1,902% over the past five years. While the 1-year gain may sound excessive, the company reported 769% year-over-year net income growth in\u00a0Q3 FY24.\n\nThe artificial intelligence leader can continue its rally as long as net income growth exceeds stock gains. A 265% year-over-year revenue gain suggests there will be more net income growth in future quarters.\n\nEventually, revenue growth will slow down, and we will have to get comfortable with high double-digit growth rates. However, Nvidia can report several quarters of high net income growth that further solidify its reasonable valuation. The company would have to reach about $1,180 to experience a 50% gain from current levels.\n\nNvidia has what it takes to become the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded corporation and dethrone\u00a0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from that title. Investors have a lot to gain even from current levels if Nvidia realizes this goal.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CELH, ELF and NVDA.

        "content": "Celsius Holdings, Inc. CELH is likely to register top-and-bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter 2023 earnings on Feb 29. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at nearly $324 million, indicating a jump of 82% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 16 cents per share, which indicates a substantial increase from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure of 1 cent. CELH has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 110.9%, on average.\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nCelsius Holdings has been benefiting from its effective distribution strategies, strong market penetration, product innovation and operational excellence. A continued focus on these areas is likely to have driven the company\u2019s fourth-quarter performance.\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Celsius Holdings Inc. Quote\n\nIncidentally, CELH witnessed solid revenue growth in North America in the third quarter owing to the increased SKU mix and gains related to PepsiCo\u2019s efficient distribution system. The company\u2019s robust expansion in the energy drink category has been working well. Additionally, Celsius Holdings\u2019 strong performance on e-commerce platforms like Amazon is an upside. This reflects impressive consumer demand and effective online marketing strategies.\r\n\r\nCelsius Holdings has also been expanding its distribution points across non-traditional channels such as colleges, universities, hospitals, hotels and eateries, which present significant growth opportunities. Apart from this, partnerships with major brands like Dunkin' Donuts and Jersey Mike's bode well.\r\n\r\nThe company emphasizes its focus on operational efficiency and leverage across its business, leading to improvements in margins. Management expects the fourth-quarter gross margin to come in line with the second-quarter and full-year margin picture.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Celsius Holdings this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.\r\n\r\nCelsius Holdings has an Earnings ESP of -4.71%, and it carries a Zacks Rank #3.

        "title": "13 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best short squeeze stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our primer on short squeezing, and some of the greatest short squeezes in history, then you can take a look at the\u00a05 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nShort selling is one of the most controversial aspects of the stock market. After all, investing is typically thought to be a 'value creating' endeavor, where both retail and professional players engage in trading to pick the right stock and make millions if not billions of dollars.\n\nOn the flip side, short selling comes with the aim of profiting from the drop in share price. Those who argue in its favor belief that it allows market players to exploit weaknesses and be rewarded for their actions. A rather controversial practice short sellers benefit when the shares of a firm, such as the well known U.S. green vehicle designer Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) or the Indian business conglomerate Adani Enterprises Limited (NSE:ADANIENT.NS), drop in value. Yet, this same drop harms existing investors as well, an occurrence that ensures that short selling will remain controversial as long as the stock markets continue to exist.\n\nWhile the profits of short selling stocks are lucrative, at the same time, betting against the wrong names can be disastrous and wipe out entire portfolios. While short sellers who target Nikola and Adani ended up being richer, the stock market is also filled with examples of stocks that ended up being short squeeze stocks. One source of controversy surrounding short selling surrounds the fact that bets against a stock are publicly visible. So, you can see what the short interest in a stock that trades on the NASDAQ exchange is simply by visiting the exchange's website. As a result, at least when it comes to the retail front, if a stock has a substantial amount of short interest, then investors looking to pick it as a long term, value creating investment will naturally wonder if there's something under the hood that's amiss.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, and particularly as events after the coronavirus pandemic have shown, short squeeze stocks can also change the fortunes of those lucky or wise enough to pick them. The pandemic, which saw populations all over the world sent indoors, also led to the two biggest short squeezes in history, the meme stocks GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC). GameStop's short squeeze dented Wall Street in ways previously unimaginable, and it even led to Senate hearings of Reddit forum members.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the all time legendary short squeeze stocks, while GameStop is well known, there are tons of others that have made even larger impacts. For instance, even as of 2021, when Insider Monkey took a look at 10 Biggest Short Squeezes of All Time, the biggest short squeeze after 13 years was Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY). The Volkswagen short squeeze cost short sellers more than three times in losses than GameStop, fueled by the fact that as Volkwagen's shares soared, it became the most valuable company in the world with a share price of \u20ac999.\n\nThe saga of Volkswagen's legendary short squeeze is more complex than the tale written by the GameStop traders. At its heart was the hedge fund industry, which sought to exploit the price differential between the firm's preferred and ordinary stock in the aftermath of legal developments in Germany that enabled a Volkswagen takeover through holding a 75% interest in the firm. Preferred stock, for those out of the loop, is a dividend paying security that does not offer its holder a stake in a publicly traded company's governance.\n\nWhen the difference in the prices between the two share classes started to grow, investors sold 12% of the ordinary shares short. But, they were caught with their pants down after Porsche revealed that it had quietly bought nearly 75% of Volkswagen's stock. This meant that as Porsche and a German State owned nearly 94% of the shares, half of those who had shorted the stock would be left without the ability to close their bets. Consequently, the mad scupper to buy Volkswagen shares ensured that Volkswagen became the world's most valuable company.

        "title": "10 Fastest Growing Energy Drink Stocks in the US",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten fastest growing energy drink stocks in the U.S. If you want to skip our overview of the global energy drink industry and the latest trends, then you can take a look at 5 Fastest Growing Energy Drink Stocks in the US.\n\nFor decades humans have been discovering ways to enhance their performance. Whether its academia, business, sports, or medicine, the use of both natural and synthetic substances is common to alter the chemistry of the human body. Natural substances such as coffee power up global workforces to an extent that America's biggest coffee chain, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), is worth a whopping $105 billion on the stock market. Similarly, anabolic steroids are some of the most watched out substances when it comes to high performance sports such as basketball, weight lifting, or football.\n\nHowever, while most coffee requires milk and steroids require a prescription, another commonly consumed drink by truckers and college students alike is an energy drink. Energy drinks come in a variety of flavors and variants, and they can be stocked well in advance to allow 'binge' drinking for the really ambitious. Some common substances found in energy drinks are caffeine and taurine, with the latter often being exclusive to energy drinks or other carbonated beverages instead of being also found in, say, coffee.\n\nOver the years, the global energy drink industry has also grown from being limited to a few players to seeing greater focus from big players such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP). With market capitalizations of $258 billion and $228 billion, they are among the biggest companies in the world that demonstrate that no matter how popular coffee is, at the end of the day a diversified business model can cater to tight consumer budgets during an economic contraction are still perceived to be worth more by both professional and retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet one of the most popular energy drink brands in the world, i.e. Red Bull, is private. Red Bull's advertisement campaigns have seen it associate its brand name with high risk activities such as the highest altitude parachute jump in the world and customized sports car racing, and when compared to its American counterpart Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), it can be safely assumed that Red Bull has a far greater brand reach.\n\nDelving deeper into the current performance and environment of the energy drink industry, these companies tend to thrive the most when consumers have more money to spend. After all, while energy drinks are popular, they still are not essential daily use products such as toilet paper and toothpaste. However, they cannot be purely classified as cyclical either, especially since a lot of energy drink users consume them daily and might skip out on other purchases to keep up their consumption during tough economic times. As an example, consider research published in the BMC Public Health journal. It used data from 266 commercial bus drivers, a physically intensive job that can require hours of sustained concentration to safely operate a vehicle to show that 32% of the drivers drank seven to ten bottles of energy drinks a week - or more than one bottle a day. Additionally, three quarters believed that drinking energy drinks would improve their work performance, and the majority were unaware of any adverse health effects.\n\nShifting towards the corporate side of things, a brief look at the latest financial results of Monster Beverage and Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) is warranted. Both of them had missed analyst EPS estimates for their fourth quarter of 2022 financials, but since then, they have either met or beaten them. During the third quarter of 2023, Celsius's revenue grew by a whopping 104% annually to sit at $385 million. The corresponding press release highlighted that these gains came on the back of an improved logistics chain that increased product availability and allowed the firm to drive up sales. Monster, a bigger company, also marked revenue growth during the quarter, as its revenue grew by 14.3% to sit at $1.86 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the firm's management shared during the earnings conference:\n\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until October 8, 2023, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 30.5% to 31.3% in France, from 29.9% to 32.4% in Great Britain, from 5.4% to 5.6% in the Netherlands, from 31.6% to 34.7% in Norway and from 40.3% to 40.5% in Spain. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of September 2023, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.6% to 18.4% in Germany, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period of the previous year remained flat at 31.6% in Italy, Monster\u2019s retail market share value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 19% to 18.4% in Poland and from 19.8% to 17.9% in South Africa.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the fastest growing energy drink stocks in the U.S. 10 Fastest Growing Energy Drink Stocks in the US\n\nPixabay / Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the ten fastest growing energy drink stocks in the U.S., we ranked the 12 stocks part of our coverage of the 12 Biggest Energy Drink Stocks in the US and tertiary energy drink stocks by their five year or all time share price performance.

Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "title": "UTZ, CELH, BRBR: Which High-Growth Food/Drink Stock Is Best?",
        "content": "High-growth consumer snacking/drink brands are looking quite interesting as some investors opt to look away from some of the loftiest parts of the tech sector in search of something richer with value. When it comes to consumer staple stocks to snack on, it\u2019s tough to top some of the smaller disruptors in the space (such as UTZ, CELH, and BRBR) as they look to nibble away at the market share of the mega-cap leaders.\n\nUndoubtedly, the large-cap snack and beverage companies have been incredibly dominant over the years, with moats previously considered impenetrable. With the rise of intriguing new brands catering to younger consumers hungry for something healthy and tasty, it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that the tables may be turned in favor of the smaller, perhaps hungrier disruptors, even as GLP-1 drugs weigh on the appetite for snacking on the whole.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s check in with TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to weigh in on three intriguing high-growth snack/beverage plays that investors may wish to snack on themselves.\n\nUtz Brands (NASDAQ:UTZ)\n\nUtz Brands has made quite the mark on the salty and savory snack scene in recent years. Though UTZ stock may be a public markets newcomer, having landed just a few years ago, I view the firm as having the high-quality product and long-term growth strategy (5-6% organic sales growth expected through Fiscal Year 2026) required to take market share in the snacking scene.\n\nAt this juncture, the stock seems priced with growth in mind, with shares going for just shy of 85 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). Still, many big names on Wall Street view the stock as undervalued, given potential catalysts on the horizon. I\u2019m inclined to agree with analysts and am staying bullish on the name.\n\nApart from the Strong Buy rating from the analyst community, Utz also has a massive fan in Needham, who recently praised Utz as worthy of its \u201cConviction List.\u201d Not only is Utz rated a Buy, but it\u2019s also a high-conviction Buy as the firm continues firing on all cylinders.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Needham, which has a $20.00 price target on the stock, Utz\u2019s \u201cmarketing consolidation\u201d and \u201cmore-targeted product portfolio\u201d are reasons to get behind the stock. Additionally, Mizuho points out that UTZ stock is also one of the few salty snacks pure-plays out there worth pursuing. I think analysts are right on the money. Utz stock deserves a premium, not just a growth premium, but a scarcity premium.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target on UTZ Stock?\n\nUtz stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with seven Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average UTZ stock price target of $19.38 implies 3.8% upside potential.\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH)\n\nThe healthy and tasty beverage scene has been scorching lately, with social media influencers like Logan Paul and KSI disrupting the sport and energy drink market with Prime. Celsius is another player on the scene that\u2019s been a hit among consumers who are looking for delicious drinks that aren\u2019t filled with sugar, corn syrup, aspartame, and other sweeteners that seem to have a bad rap. Undoubtedly, Celsius shows that you don\u2019t need to sacrifice taste when cutting sugar (and other unpopular sweeteners) out of the equation.\n\nAlthough the stock is getting expensive again after its glorious 28% pop this month, I\u2019m a big believer in the brand and its ability to continue taking share in the beverage scene. For that reason, I have to stay bullish.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s hard to be bearish when you have Piper Sandler stepping up a month ago, when the stock was in a bit of a funk, calling CELH stock the best growth story in the consumer space. The analyst firm was spot-on. The stock has been surging since back around the same time Piper analyst Michael Lavery pounded the table on the name.\n\nThough Lavery is a bull, with a Street-high price target of $76.00 (that implies almost 20% upside from current levels), he\u2019s not at all an unrealistic one, with expectations that growth will slow (to 40-45% this year). With the tools to take more market share, though, don\u2019t expect growth to drop off by much more as the firm looks to keep its disruptor hat on. Recently, the firm launched a line of products to the Canadian market, a move that could easily jolt growth and give Prime a good run for its money.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target on UTZ Stock?\n\nCelsius Holdings stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with six Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average CELH stock price target of $69.50 implies 9.4% upside potential.\n\nBellRing Brands (NASDAQ:BRBR)\n\nWith its protein focus, BellRing Brands has to be one of the healthiest snacking plays on the planet. The firm behind PowerBars and Premier Protein may be a relative newcomer to the public market scene since landing back in 2019, but it\u2019s shown us all the power of protein in today\u2019s increasingly health-conscious world.\n\nNow, the business of protein drinks, bars, and powders can be tough to compete in. Not only do you need a tasty product that\u2019s packed with nutrition, but you also need top-notch manufacturing capabilities and impressive marketing to stay ahead of the pack.\n\nFortunately, BellRing Brands seems to have everything down to stay dominant in the competitive protein scene. With a well-known line-up of brands (almost everybody at the gym knows about the iconic PowerBar) and an aggressive growth strategy (new products, including plant-based protein powders, and geographic expansion potential), it\u2019s hard not to be bullish as BRBR stock continues its incredible run.\n\nThe stock is up more than 75% in the past year, and though shares have come in by around 9% since its February 2024 high, I view the decline as more of an opportunity than a red flag. With impressive growth drivers poised to power earnings from here, BRBR is a name to hang onto for the long haul.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target on BRBR Stock?\n\nBellBring stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 10 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average BRBR stock price target of $60.50 implies 10.6% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe snack and fizzy beverage scene may be low-tech, but it\u2019s clearly full of growth potential. As the tech trade sours, don\u2019t count on the following consumer growth darlings to sink as well. Of the trio, analysts expect the most upside potential from BRBR (10.6%).\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Growth stocks give investors the opportunity to earn elevated returns that outperform market indices. These corporations often exhibit rising revenue and earnings. Getting into these stocks early can offer tremendous upside.\n\nSome of these stocks fly under the radar for several months or years before they get mainstream attention. Therefore, investors looking for ways to grow their capital may want to consider these three assets.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) offers affordable beauty and skincare products and is a big hit among Gen Z. The company only uses ethical ingredients in its beauty products. People are becoming more conscious of the ingredients they consume, which bodes well for the beauty corporation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso, this shift in consumer behavior has rewarded long-term investors. Elf Beauty delivered another quarter of impressive results, highlighted by\u00a085% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth. The cosmetics firm increased its market share by 305 basis points and achieved its 20th consecutive quarter of sales growth.\n\nAdditionally, net income grew at an even faster pace and was up by 184% YOY. The company\u2019s net profit margin came in at 15.44%. Elf Beauty has been a top momentum stock with a 123% gain over the past year and a 5-year gain of 1,678%. Shares trade at a 48.5 forward P/E ratio.\n\nLooking forward, valuation will become more attractive as ELF continues to report high revenue and net income growth. Therefore, investors should have a multi-year horizon if they want to accumulate shares in this corporation.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSports drinks are a hot commodity. Loyal customers frequently buy these beverages, allowing companies to report high revenue and earnings growth. These drinks become engrained habits that fit into people\u2019s day-to-day lives.\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is capitalizing on the sports drink market and is gobbling up market share. Revenue increased by 104% YOY in the third quarter of 2023. Almost all of the firm\u2019s revenue comes from North America. CELH is now starting to penetrate international markets, which can lead to explosive revenue growth moving forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy the time domestic revenue growth decelerates, international sales can take its place. Also, the company is extremely profitable, reporting 146% YOY net income growth. This improvement helped the company secure a 21.82% net profit margin in the quarter.\n\nDespite soaring by 5,247% over the past five years, Celsius Holdings\u2019 stock has only been up by 3% over the past six months. Thus, a rally seems imminent. And investors have already bid up the stock by 25% since the end of January. The company\u2019s March earnings report can serve as a catalyst for a higher stock price.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) is a construction company that develops e-infrastructure solutions in high-demand markets like the southeast and southwest portions of the U.S.\n\nE-infrastructure solutions encompass data centers, warehouses, and other types of properties. Data center demand has been picking up due to AI and has helped the stock surge in recent years.\n\nSterling Infrastructure\u2019s stock has more than doubled over the past year and is up by 480% over the past five years. Despite the big rally, shares still trade at a 17-forward P/E ratio and a\u00a00.87 PEG ratio. These valuation metrics suggest the stock has more room to run.\n\nSTRL delivered robust financials in the\u00a0third quarter of 2023. Diluted EPS increased by 25% YOY while the e-infrastructure solutions backlog reached $891 million. That represents a 48% YOY increase. The company\u2019s profit margins have been rising quickly. Further, it is possible for the company to report double-digit profit margins in one of its 2024 reports.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF and CELH.

        "content": "You don\u2019t have to stay on top of the stock market and make quick trading decisions to be a successful investor. Some people outperform the market by investing in solid, long-term stocks and letting time do its magic. These investors can then focus on growing their income so they can make higher portfolio contributions in the future.\n\nBetter, long-term stocks have promising growth prospects and operate in promising industries. If you wait long enough, these seven growth stocks, for example, can generate meaningful returns.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers a healthy sports drink that is captivating Gen Z and broader audiences. Drinks contain seven essential vitamins and do not include any sugar, high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, or aspartame. Celsius compensates by putting a lot of caffeine in its drinks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius is positioned as the front-runner for healthy energy drinks. As people look for healthy choices that don\u2019t require them to make inconvenient sacrifices, Celsius can continue to gain market share. The beverage tastes good based on its 104% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0third quarter of 2023. People aren\u2019t going to buy that much product if it tastes bad.\n\nCelsius Holdings has generated meaningful long-term value for shareholders. The equity has gained 5,247% over the past five years. The stock is also up by 94% over the past year but has been trading sideways for the past six months. The reduced activity over the past six months makes the stock more attractive heading into earnings.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother one of the top long-term stocks to consider is Visa (NYSE:V), which offers stability and growth for long-term investors. Credit and debit cards are integral to society and are the preferred payment method for many consumers. It\u2019s hard to resist cashback rewards and other perks that come with these cards.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa\u2019s latest earnings report showcased this truth. Revenue jumped by 9% year-over-year in Q1 FY24 while GAAP net income increased by 17% year-over-year. GAAP EPS growth outpaced GAAP net income growth due to the company\u2019s commitment to repurchase shares.\n\nVisa bought back $3.4 billion worth of shares in the quarter. The fintech company distributed $1.06 billion in dividends during the quarter. Visa\u00a0hiked its dividend near the end of 2023 by 15.5% year-over-year. The quarterly dividend per share jumped from $0.45 to $0.52 as part of the hike.\n\nVisa has been a steady gainer. The stock is up by 21% over the past year and has gained 92% over the past five years.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an advertising leader and stands to reward shareholders as another one of the top long-term stocks to own. The company recently achieved 13% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2023 compared to a 1% year-over-year growth rate.\n\nAd revenue will likely increase even more in 2024 due to the Olympics, Elections, and other factors. While advertisements are the majority of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, the company has reinvested its revenue into other ventures.\n\nGoogle Cloud is the most successful segment outside of Google advertisements. Cloud revenue jumped from $7.3 billion to $9.2 billion year-over-year. This component of Alphabet\u2019s business recently became profitable.\n\nAlphabet will continue to use some of its capital to fund \u201cOther Bets.\u201d It\u2019s a small category filled with unprofitable high-growth opportunities that can become meaningful segments in the future.\u00a0Alphabet has been a staple in many funds. Shares are up by 57% over the past year and have gained 167% over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to deliver top-line and bottom-line growth for investors. The tech giant reported 18% year-over-year revenue growth and 33% year-over-year net income growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\u00a0It\u2019s also another one of the top long-term stocks to buy and hold.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella cited \u201capplying AI at scale\u201d as a reason the company is winning new customers and driving productivity gains across every sector. Microsoft Cloud has also been a core component of the company\u2019s success. Cloud revenue increased by 24% year-over-year and made up more than half of the company\u2019s total revenue.\n\nMicrosoft is currently the most valuable company on the stock market with a market cap above $3 trillion. Shares have rallied by 49% over the past year and have surged by 275% over the past five years.\n\nMany funds have large amounts of this stock, and it\u2019s a top holding in the\u00a0Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500. The company offers a healthy blend of stability and growth while trading at a 37 P/E ratio. The stock\u2019s dividend yield is currently 0.75%.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is a leader in the credit and debit card industry that offers healthy profit margins. The fintech company closed out 2023 with 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year net income growth. Those growth rates helped the company maintain a net profit margin above 40%.\n\nThe dividend growth stock has rewarded investors with a 26% gain over the past year and is up by 109% over the past five years. The stock only offers a 0.57% dividend yield, but growth has been impressive. Mastercard raised its quarterly dividend per share from $0.57 to $0.66 in 2024. That\u2019s a 15.8% year-over-year increase.\n\nMastercard didn\u2019t stop with dividends. The company also repurchased 4.5 million shares for $1.8 billion. For comparison, Mastercard only distributed $534 million in dividends during the same quarter. Buybacks exceeded dividends by a wide margin in 2023, which suggests the company has a lot of room to hike its dividends.\n\nCEO Michael Miebach cited strong consumer spending and cross-border volume growth as key catalysts for the successful quarter. Mastercard has various rewards cards to the point where there\u2019s something for everyone.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors look at a stock\u2019s historical performance to gauge if it is a promising investment. While stock analyses must go deeper than one-year and five-year charts, strong gains during both of these timeframes can make a stock look more attractive.\n\nInvestors with this mentality will want to give\u00a0Elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) a closer look. The stock has gained 123% over the past year and is up by 1,678% over the past five years. Any investor would want those numbers, but they must also consider if a rapidly growing stock still offers a good opportunity at the current price.\n\nElf Beauty once again delivers on this front, and the recent\u00a0Q3 FY24 report demonstrates why investors are accumulating more shares. During this quarter, Elf Beauty achieved 85% year-over-year net sales growth and 184% year-over-year net income growth. The quarter marked the 20th consecutive quarter in which Elf Beauty gained market share and reported net sales growth.\n\nThat type of track record makes the stock more promising for long-term investors. Shares currently trade at a 48.5 forward P/E ratio that can get lower as the firm continues to deliver impressive results.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) offers compelling growth in a high-demand vertical. The company\u2019s language learning app grew its revenue by 43% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2023. Duolingo also experienced meaningful growth in its active users. Monthly active users were up by 47% year-over-year while daily active users increased by 63% year-over-year.\n\nThe company\u2019s financial growth and business opportunities will attract growth investors. The only concern is the stock\u2019s valuation. Duolingo currently trades with a\u00a093-forward P/E ratio. That\u2019s not for everyone but the valuation will become more manageable within a few years.\n\nLong-term investors may want to nibble on the stock and build positions as the valuation becomes easier to justify. The asset will look more attractive on pullbacks. While this is true about any stock, Duolingo has the distinction of meaningful revenue and net income growth. Not every publicly traded corporation can make that same claim.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CELH, GOOG, MSFT, and ELF. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.comPublishing Guidelines.\n\nMarc Guberti is a finance freelance writer at InvestorPlace.com who hosts the Breakthrough Success Podcast.

        "content": "The Russell 2000 is one of the most popular indexes, and it consists of the smallest 2000 companies in the Russell 3000. Most companies in the index are small and mid cap, thereby presenting more volatility; however, during this time, there is also opportunity for strong growth. 2023 was a difficult year for the index, partially due to the economic instability, and in 2024 many stocks in the index are trading at a discount. Below are three of the best Russell 2000 stocks to buy in February 2024.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) Graphic of green and blue arrow against pale green background pointing up and to the right, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ex_artist\n\nCelsius (NASDAQ:CELH) is an American energy drink company that has been taking the market by storm. Their stock price has increased by almost 100% in the past year and over 5000% in the past 5 years, however, they still have room for growth.\n\nThe company has been recently implementing a successful advertisement strategy involving sports such as F1 and college football, which has boosted its bottom line. In addition, they have been opening avenues of growth through expanding to new international markets, recently announcing they will begin distribution in Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland, all three markets which around bound to improve the company\u2019s financials.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company\u2019s financials are also very strong. Celsius reported revenue of $384.7 million, which marks an increase of over 100% year over year. The company also reported net income of $84 million, which represents an increase of nearly 150% year over year. The company is stable, rapidly growing, with the potential to surpass its current rate.\n\nCrocs (CROX) Hand pointing up and to the right with blue arrow, symbolizes growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nCrocs (NASDAQ:CROX) was founded in 1999 and is one of the biggest shoe designers and producers in the United States. The company is known for its innovative styles and has since expanded to accessories and acquisition of other shoe retailers such as Heydude. The company has surged in popularity, becoming one of the most well-known footwear companies. Its revenue and earnings also support this, as they have been in a steady uptrend.\r\nThe acquisition of Heydude was misevaluated and has been hurting Croc\u2019s performance. Heydude footwear saw a decrease of about 10% in revenue after the company was acquired, slowing down Crocs\u2019 overall growth. Meanwhile, revenue for Crocs brand footwear increased 15%, an impressive figure that is hidden from Heydude\u2019s declines. Though the acquisition is a present challenge for Crocs, it is clear that the company\u2019s main segment is strong and will be able to continue growing at high rates. The stock is down 28% from its 2023 peak (primarily from the acquisition), and now is a great time to buy a stable company at a major discount.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnsign Group (ENSG) Explore the stock market trends for 2024 with analytical visuals of businessman planning long term investments and future business growth, Navigate towards success with smart strategies. growth stocks with millionaire potential\n\nSource: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnsign Group (NASDAQ:ENSG) is an American company that offers health care services in nursing, urgent care, rehabilitative care, and senior assisted living facilities. The company has been growing at a fast-pace in recent years, and it has successfully positioned itself to capitalize on accelerating America\u2019s aging population. This general economic trend will most likely act as a long-term growth catalyst.\n\nCompared to the industry average net income growth at 8.5%, Ensign has been outpacing its competitors at triple the rate in the past 5 years. The company has also been very efficient in re-investing with just under 95% of its profits getting reinvested into the business for growth. With the release of its recent fourth-quarter earnings report, the company showed promising financials. For the past four consecutive quarters, Ensign exceeded the expected EPS estimates and their EPS grew 16.4% YoY. With such impressive financials and growth potential, Ensign will continue to surpass its competitors in the industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tomas Levani did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, which Celsius Holdings Inc. falls in, has lost 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Celsius Holdings Inc. is expected to post earnings of $0.16 per share, indicating a change of +1,500% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $0.75 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +185.2%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.95 indicates a change of +26.7% from what Celsius Holdings Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Celsius Holdings Inc.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Celsius Holdings Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $323.96 million indicates a year-over-year change of +82%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion estimates indicate +98.2% and +39.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. reported revenues of $384.76 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +104.4%. EPS of $0.30 for the same period compares with -$0.24 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $348.35 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.45%. The EPS surprise was +81.63%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Celsius Holdings Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Two of the most successful companies in U.S. history are centered around beverage products. Of course, I\u2019m talking about Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The two firms\u2019 sodas have become well-known and popular in much of the world, with KO, in particular, becoming quite ubiquitous globally. As a result of these trends, the market capitalizations of Coca-Cola and Pepsi are a huge $257 billion and $240 billion, respectively. But other U.S. beverage firms have also been successful. For example, the market capitalizations of Keurig Dr. Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) are now $44 billion and $59 billion, respectively.\n\nWhile we may not see another Coca-Cola or PepsiCo in our lifetimes, the beverage sector is very lucrative for some companies. Here are three beverage stocks that can grow explosively over the long term. And who knows? Maybe one of these firms could catch fire and become the next Coke or Pepsi.\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nMonster is a leader in the U.S. energy-drink category and that category is rapidly growing. According to Statista, the revenue generated by energy drinks in America jumped 13.7% in 2022 and 12.9% in 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s not surprising that Monster\u2019s top and bottom lines are also rapidly increasing. In Q3 of last year, for example, its revenue jumped 16% versus the same period a year earlier, while its net income surged 40% year-over-year (YoY) to $453 million.\n\nAlso encouraging is that the revenue generated by Monster\u2019s emerging alcoholic beverages jumped 58% YoY to $42.3 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the Street is quite upbeat on MNST. In December, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) identified MNST as one of 37 high-growth stocks with low volume. In January, it identified the name as a high-quality growth stock.\n\nAnd last month, Goldman (NYSE:GS) identified MNST as one of the top beneficiaries of strong return-on-equity growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe popularity of Celsius\u2019 (NASDAQ:CELH) healthy carbonated energy drink offerings is growing rapidly, and the firm is taking market share in the popular category. Indeed, as I noted in a previous column, CELH\u2019s \u201crevenue soared 105% in the four-week period that ended on December 30,\u201d according to research firm Nielsen.\n\nThe firm has already expanded to Canada and intends to start selling its beverages in a wide variety of countries over the longer term. Of course, Celsius\u2019 overseas expansion should cause its growth to accelerate to even more impressive levels.\n\nCelsius\u2019 sales doubled in the first three quarters of 2024, and the fact that it\u2019s offering healthy, fairly good-tasting (in my view) products in the rapidly growing energy-drink category leaves it well-positioned to be extremely successful down the road.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily gave CELH a fairly high Composite Rating of 83 out of 99.\n\nZevia PBC (ZVIA) Food Trends\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/rsi1986\n\nZeviaPBC (NYSE:ZVIA) markets its namesake sodas that, as far as I can tell, are the only carbonated beverages available on a wide scale sweetened solely by stevia.\n\nUnlike sugar, stevia has no calories or known, major, negative impact on people\u2019s health. Moreover, the chemicals used to make diet sodas, such as aspartame, have also been identified as potentially having very negative effects on humans. For example, the International Agency for Research on Cancer found that aspartame may cause cancer, and some indications show it could undermine memory.\n\nAs someone who drinks both Zevia\u2019s products and diet soda rather frequently, I can attest that, in my view, Zevia\u2019s sodas taste around 20% to 30% better than diet sodas.\n\nZevia\u2019s top line dropped 2.6% in Q3 versus the same period a year earlier, while it generated a per-share loss of 16 cents.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s gross margin of 45% is quite high, indicating it could increase its sales and market share a great deal by lowering its prices. What\u2019s more, the firm reported in November that it had supply chain issues and was taking multiple steps to rectify them.\n\nFinally, ZVIA reported \u201cthe world\u2019s largest retailer,\u201d presumably WalMart (NYSE:WMT), had been trialing \u201cthe brand\u2019s performance in the mainstream carbonated soft aisle.\u201d Sales of Zevia\u2019s products at WMT jumped by triple-digit percentage levels and were \u201coutperforming expectations,\u201d Zevia added.\n\nThe superior healthiness of Zevia\u2019s beverages and its success at WalMart bodes very well for the long-term outlook of ZVIA stock.\n\nGiven these points, I think it has the highest ceiling among beverage stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "A company's growth can tell investors a lot. Companies that grow their revenue at high rates over a long period of time typically deliver superior returns to the broad market.\n\nAnd this kind of robust revenue growth has sent the stocks of energy drink maker Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) and emerging cosmetics brand e.l.f. Beauty(NYSE: ELF) up 80% and 140%, respectively, over the last year. Here's what's fueling these companies' momentum and why I wouldn't hesitate to buy shares right now.\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nEmerging beverage brand Celsius has used a lucrative distribution agreement with PepsiCo to gain market share in the $159 billion energy drink market. The strong demand for its products is fueling the same level of rapid expansion that sent Monster Beverage stock up over 50,000% in the last 20 years.\n\nCelsius started as a pre-workout dietary supplement over 10 years ago, but it's now expanding its presence across retail stores thanks to PepsiCo. The two companies struck an agreement in 2022 that allows PepsiCo to be the company's primary distribution supplier, and Celsius is set to begin expanding internationally in Canada this quarter, which could open the floodgates for additional growth.\n\nCelsius is distinguishing itself from industry leaders like Monster Energy and Red Bull with its focus on \"better-for-you\" marketing. It makes drinks to assist with weight loss and features no sugar or artificial ingredients. That approach has resonated with consumers as its revenue surged 104% year over year through the first nine months of 2023.\n\nManagement sees significant potential for the brand over the next five years, which justifies the stock's high forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 55. The company's market-share gains in a massive energy drink market should send the stock to new highs over the next few years and beyond.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty\n\nAnother fast-growing consumer brand is e.l.f. Beauty. It's an emerging leader in a $600 billion personal care and beauty market. E.l.f. stock climbed 140% over the last 12 months as it hits new all-time highs thanks to its latest business update.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing three consecutive quarters of at least 75% revenue growth last year, the company's revenue rose 85% in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Dec. 31). During the period, e.l.f. also acquired skincare brand Naturium for $333 million, which extends the company's growth opportunity.\n\nThe acquisition of Naturium is part of management's plan to leverage its brand momentum in skincare, where e.l.f. is already growing about 10 times faster than competitors.\n\nIn cosmetics, e.l.f. continues to win big through its partnership with Target, where its value-priced products are outselling established cosmetics brands. Management is focused on replicating the Target strategy with other retailers.\n\nThe stock's forward P/E of 59 is expensive, but the company's impressive trajectory makes a strong case for the stock. Analysts have been raising their growth estimates and now expect earnings to grow over 30% annually over the next three to five years. Even with the stock reaching new highs, there's enough fuel in the tank for e.l.f to deliver market-beating returns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Celsius wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 5, 2024\n\nJohn Ballard has positions in Celsius and e.l.f.

        "content": "Dips offer wonderful opportunities to pick up shares of your favorite companies at a discount. The stock market experiences many fluctuations, and equities can go down even if there isn\u2019t any news tied to them.\n\nA stock isn\u2019t necessarily a buy just because it is more than 10% below its all-time high. However, some stocks only have valuation as a concern. When these stocks dip, they offer investors a greater margin of safety. If these growth stocks to buy dip down, you may want to consider accumulating shares.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a beauty brand experiencing rapid growth and healthy profit margins. The company reported 76% year-over-year (YoY) net sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 while increasing net income by 184% YoY.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nE.l.f. Beauty closed out the quarter with a 15.4% net profit margin. The corporation also raised its outlook for fiscal 2024. This context comes as the company achieved 19 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, with fiscal 2023 representing a significant takeoff in the company\u2019s revenue growth rate.\n\nThe company is gaining market share, while many of its competitors are losing ground. This data point comes from Nielsen XAOC and is displayed on the 10th page of e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s Q2 FY 2024 Earnings Webcast Presentation.\n\nELF makes itself different from the competition by avoiding unethical ingredients. Consumers can use e.l.f. Beauty products without wondering if an animal had to suffer to get the ingredient. Unfortunately, many beauty firms overlook this practice in exchange for the ingredients they seek.\n\nThis beauty company\u2019s differentiation and product line resulted in the equity gaining 1,684% over the past five years. Shares are up by 130% over the past year.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) omits many of the unhealthy ingredients common in other sports drinks. The company\u2019s beverages do not contain high fructose corn syrup, sugar, artificial colors, gluten or aspartame.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe drink continued to fly off shelves and resulted in 104% YoY revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. Net income also more than doubled YoY. The stock has delivered a 76% gain for investors over the past year and recorded a 5-year gain of over 4,244%.\n\nDespite the high growth rates, Celsius Holdings is still in its early innings. The company makes the overwhelming majority of its revenue from North America. Its global footprint is very small, and the company is investing in international expansion.\n\nCelsius Holdings\u2019 entry into international markets will allow it to tap into a vast addressable market. Strong demand in North America suggests consumers are looking for healthier alternatives. Celsius Holdings can deliver on this sentiment while rewarding long-term shareholders.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a few bad quarters, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) shares are rallying. The stock is up by 20% year-to-date and has gained 330% over the past five years. Fortinet offers cybersecurity solutions in secure networking, security operations and universal SASE.\n\nThese three segments have a total addressable market of $125 billion in 2023. TAM is expected to reach $199 billion by 2027. Universal SASE has the highest projected compounded annual growth rate at 20% from 2023 to 2027.\n\nMost of Fortinet\u2019s billings are in the Secure Networking segment. The segment made up 70% of Fortinet\u2019s total billings, while Security Operations and Universal SASE made up 10% and 20% of Q3 2023 billings, respectively.\n\nThe firm\u2019s main weakness is a deceleration in billings growth. The growth rate only came in at 5.7% YoY in the third quarter compared to 30%+ in previous quarters. Lower billings growth accompanied lower revenue growth, but profit margins remained elevated.\n\nOther cybersecurity stocks have soared past Fortinet, but the firm now has a more reasonable valuation.

The firm narrowed its GAAP net losses from $42.5 million in losses to $23.5 million in losses.\n\nThe stock can get more enticing as Cloudflare gets closer to profitability, but investors have already been loading up on shares. The equity is up by 57% over the past year and has gained 361% over the past five years.\n\nCloudflare innovated and accelerated its efforts in artificial intelligence to strengthen its product offerings. This development can increase retention rates and lead to higher subscription costs in the future.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) achieved double-digit revenue growth rates across its two key verticals: advertising and the cloud. Revenue in the Google advertising segment was up by 11.0% year-over-year while Google Cloud revenue jumped by 25.7% year-over-year.\n\nThose segments and Alphabet\u2019s other verticals resulted in 13% year-over-year revenue growth for the company as a whole in Q4 2023. Alphabet\u2019s \u201cOther Bets\u201d segment almost tripled year-over-year, and comments from Alphabet\u2019s CFO Ruth Porat suggest that those investments will continue.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to our work to durably re-engineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth opportunities,\u201d Porat stated in the press release.\n\nAlphabet achieved revenue and earnings growth while reducing its employee count by almost 8,000. The company let go roughly 4% of its workforce in 2023. Google Cloud once again delivered high profits while the company\u2019s \u201cOther Bets\u201d segment delivers a relatively small net loss. Alphabet managed to narrow losses across this division.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a customer relationship management platform that helps businesses grow. The company has over 194,000 customers in 120 countries and has a range of affordable and high-end plans.\n\nThe tech software firm increased revenue by 26% year-over-year in Q3 2023 and significantly narrowed its net losses. The company looks like it is on the verge of profitability and should scale up its profit margins quickly.\n\nThis development would help the stock tremendously, but it has already been on an incredible run. Shares are up by 68% over the past year and have gained 270% over the past five years. HubSpot is charging closer to the all-time high it set in 2021.\n\nThe company\u2019s customer base grew by 225% year-over-year which indicates solid demand for the platform. HubSpot is making money by raising its prices and getting customers to upgrade their plans. However, the ability to still attract new customers at this high rate points to more gains.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has outperformed the S&P 500 over several years. The index\u2019s 79% gain over the past five years falls well below the beauty firm\u2019s 1,790% gain during the same period. Elf Beauty has robust revenue and net income growth that suggest it can continue to outperform the index.\n\nHowever, there is another catalyst for this stock that investors may be overlooking. Elf Beauty currently has a market cap just shy of $9 billion. This high growth stock is getting closer to the critical $12.7 billion market cap threshold.\n\nWhy is this number important? A company must exceed $12.7 billion in market cap to be considered for inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Elf Beauty fulfills the other key requirements and can get added to the index in the future. The equity has to rally by close to 50% from current levels to be within the range of S&P 500 inclusion.\n\nGetting added to the index can help shares reach all-time highs as fund managers have to load up on the stock. However, the company is already doing just fine with 76% year-over-year revenue growth and 184% year-over-year net income growth in Q2 FY24.\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) Hand pointing upward next to upward trend stock chart in purple and blackish blue lighting, symbolizes growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) shares soared to an all-time high after the firm reported earnings. While the stock quickly lost some ground, it indicates plenty of excitement for the stock.\n\nThat excitement can continue to build as other artificial intelligence leaders report earnings. Supermicro also seems poised to beat its guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 based on the rapid acceleration in business during the previous quarter.\n\nRevenue more than doubled year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 while net income increased by 68.2% year-over-year. CEO Charles Liang expressed optimism that the company is generating more demand.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to win new partners, our current end customers continue to demand more Supermicro\u2019s optimized AI computer platforms and rack-scale Total IT Solutions,\u201d he stated.\n\nSupermicro offers great potential as it is, but an S&P 500 inclusion can help shares soar higher. Supermicro meets the standards for S&P 500 inclusion. The company has a market cap over $12.7 billion and reported positive earnings in the most recent quarter and year.\n\nInstitutional investors will be forced to buy more shares for funds that track the S&P 500. This development will reward investors who accumulate SMCI stock before the inclusion.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a small sports beverage company that is quickly becoming mainstream. The equity has a $12 billion market cap and has gained more than 3,700% over the past five years.\n\nThe stock trades at a lofty 45 forward P/E ratio but has many growth catalysts that suggest a premium valuation is warranted. The firm grew its net income by 146% year-over-year in a record-breaking quarter. Revenue growth came in at 104% year-over-year.\n\nCelsius Holdings enjoys an elevated 21.8% net profit margin and hasn\u2019t even cracked into the international markets yet. The sports beverage company is just getting started on this venture as a partnership with Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) makes it more feasible.\n\nBuilding an international presence can help Celsius Holdings maintain triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters or even multiple years.

        "title": "Forget Apple: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "content": "Apple has been one of the market's greatest growth stocks. Its shares soared 46,650% over the past two decades as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad revolutionized the digital music, smartphone, and tablet computing markets, respectively. Apple continued growing after Steve Jobs' death in 2011, and it expanded its ecosystem of subscription-based services while rolling out fresh products like the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, and Vision Pro.\n\nBut this year, Apple might be due for a breather as its iPhone sales slow down. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise just 3% and 7%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 (which ends this September) -- and those growth rates seem a bit low for a stock that trades at 28 times forward earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.\n\nApple might still be a good long-term investment, but investors shouldn't be too surprised if its rally stalls out this year. Therefore, investors looking for some beefier gains should consider buying these three higher-growth stocks -- PDD Holdings(NASDAQ: PDD), Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), and On Holding (NYSE: ONON) -- instead of Apple in 2024.\n\n1. PDD Holdings\n\nPDD, more commonly known as Pinduoduo, is the third-largest e-commerce company in China after Alibaba and JD.com. However, it's growing a lot faster than both of those market leaders.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2022, PDD's revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 78%, and analysts expect it to continue expanding at a CAGR of 46% from 2022 to 2025. PDD also turned profitable in 2021, and its net profit nearly quadrupled in 2022. Analysts expect its net profit to increase at a CAGR of 41% from 2022 to 2025. Those are jaw-dropping growth rates for a stock that trades at just 19 times forward earnings.\n\nPDD initially carved out a high-growth niche with its discount marketplace, which encouraged China's lower-income shoppers to team up and score steep discounts on bulk purchases. It then capitalized on its popularity to build an online agricultural platform that allowed farmers to directly ship their fresh produce to consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also recently expanded into the U.S. and Europe with Temu, a shopping app that allows its Chinese merchants to reach overseas shoppers. As PDD has expanded, its profitability has improved as its scales up its business and phases out its lower-margin first-party marketplace.\n\nPDD's valuation is being compressed by the market's aversion to Chinese stocks, but it could rally much higher if the regulatory headwinds dissipate and more investors recognize its explosive growth potential.\n\n2. Celsius Holdings\n\nCelsius sells sugar-free energy drinks made from natural ingredients like green tea, ginger, and amino acids. It claims its drinks have \"thermogenic\" properties that accelerate metabolism and burn body fat during workouts.\n\nThat health-conscious approach enabled Celsius to grow rapidly over the past few years and become the third-largest energy drink brand in the U.S. after Red Bull and Monster Beverage. Celsius also signed a U.S. distribution deal with PepsiCo in 2022, which should significantly boost its retail presence and brand recognition. The company still generates most of its revenue from the U.S. market, but it plans to gradually expand internationally over the next three to five years.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2022, Celsius' revenue rose at a CAGR of 88%. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive in 2019 and grew at a CAGR of 160% over the following three years.\n\nFrom 2022 to 2025, analysts expect its revenue to expand at a CAGR of 53% as its adjusted EBITDA increases at a CAGR of 91%. Those are stunning growth rates for a stock that trades at 53 times next year's adjusted EBITDA.\n\n3. On Holding\n\nOn is a Swiss maker of athletic footwear and apparel. It's a lot smaller than Nike and Adidas, but it's growing at a much faster rate. From 2019 to 2022, its net sales rose at a CAGR of 66%. Analysts expect it to continue growing at a CAGR of 34% from 2022 to 2025.\n\nOn's shoes use its proprietary CloudTec cushions, which expand while a foot is airborne and lock down for a firmer foundation when it hits the ground. The popularity of its shoes -- along with endorsements from famous Swiss athletes like Nicola Spirig and Roger Federer -- enabled On to dominate the Swiss footwear market and gain footholds in the U.S. and Chinese markets.\n\nOn turned profitable in 2022, and analysts expect its net profit to grow at a CAGR of 63% from 2022 to 2025.\n\nOn, like athleisure leader Lululemon Athletica, sells its products at premium prices, tightly limits its markdowns, and is aggressively expanding its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel to boost its gross margins and reduce its dependence on wholesale retailers. That sounds like a recipe for long-term success, but its stock still trades just a few dollars above its initial public offering price and looks like a screaming bargain at 30 times forward earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in On Holding right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in On Holding, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and On Holding wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Celsius Stock (NASDAQ:CELH): How Promising Is Its International Expansion?",
        "content": "Many companies are seeking international expansion as a way to generate higher revenue and earnings growth. For instance,\u00a0Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0(NYSE:WMT) posted higher\u00a0international revenue growth\u00a0than\u00a0domestic revenue growth.\u00a0Celsius Holdings\u00a0(NASDAQ:CELH), a sports beverage company now entering international markets for the first time through a partnership with\u00a0Pepsi\u00a0(NASDAQ:PEP), has a lot to gain.\n\nCELH is slowly penetrating international markets, which can help the stock march higher, making me bullish. Investors are feeling optimistic about the company\u2019s chances and aren\u2019t afraid to pay a premium. Shares currently trade at a forward P/E ratio of 46.5. It\u2019s time to examine why bullish investors believe Celsius Holdings is worth the premium and how international expansion can impact its total sales.\n\nWhy Are Celsius Beverages Different?\n\nCelsius\u2019 stock price has skyrocketed by about 4,000% over the past five years. The company has been doing several things right to warrant that type of increase. The\u00a0average CELH stock price target of $71.69 from 13 analysts even implies 28.5% upside from current levels.\n\nThe company offers a tasty sports beverage drink that is healthier than most of the competition. The drink has sparkling and non-carbonated flavors, is non-GMO, and does not contain high fructose corn syrup, a common ingredient in most sports beverages. The drink is also free of added sodium, soy, gluten, and sugar. Celsius drinks consist of seven essential vitamins.\n\nThis combination of health benefits helped Celsius Holdings\u00a0increase its revenue by 104% year-over-year\u00a0in the third quarter of 2023. The company recently became profitable and delivered 137.8% year-over-year net income growth in the same quarter.\n\nHow Much Can International Expansion Help?\n\nInternational expansion will help any company. Offering products and services outside of the United States allows companies to reach more potential customers. However, it can have a tremendous impact on Celsius Holdings. Some companies prioritize international markets when their domestic growth rates decelerate. However, Celsius is still achieving meaningful revenue growth in North America.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note how much of the company\u2019s revenue comes from the continent. Out of the company\u2019s $385 million in total revenue, $371 million came from North America. That\u2019s 96.4% of the company\u2019s total revenue.\n\nMany bullish investors have compared Celsius Holdings to\u00a0Monster Beverage\u00a0(NASDAQ:MNST). For context, Monster has a market cap that\u2019s almost five times higher than Celsius Holdings\u2019 market cap.\n\nMonster Beverage has been\u00a0gaining market share\u00a0in many international regions. Higher market share translated into 20.2% year-over-year International revenue growth in\u00a0Q3 2023. The company generated $733.7 million in International revenue, which represents close to 40% of total net sales.\n\nTotal revenue was $1.86 billion, which was up by 14.3% year-over-year. Without the International segment, Monster Beverage only generated $1.13 billion in Q3 revenue.\n\nFor every dollar Monster makes in the U.S., it makes roughly $0.65 in International sales. Giving Celsius Holdings that ratio can lead to substantially higher revenue.\n\nWith a 1.65 multiplier from a large international presence, Celsius Holdings\u2019 Q3-2023 revenue would have jumped from $385 million to $612.2 million. I am using the $371 million in North American revenue as the multiplier ($371 million x 1.65 = $612.2 million).\n\nThis new revenue figure represents a 225.3% year-over-year increase compared to $188.2 million in Q3-2022 revenue. Assuming the net profit margin of 21.82% remains the same, profits would have been $133.6 million instead of $84.0 million for Q3 2023.\n\nCelsius isn\u2019t likely to generate roughly 40% of its revenue from international markets anytime soon. However, long-term investors can wait patiently for the company to get closer to that percentage.\n\nIf Celsius Holdings has the same international reception as it did in the U.S., investors may enjoy triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth in those markets for a few years. It\u2019s this possibility, combined with a dominant domestic performance, that has this stock trading at a high valuation.\n\nIs CELH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, CELH stock comes in as a Strong Buy based on 11 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. As stated earlier, analysts project 28.5% upside in Celsius stock, but the highest price target of $83.33 suggests even more optimism. This price target suggests 49% upside from the current price. Even the lowest price target of $64 per share implies a 14.7% gain.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Celsius Holdings Stock\n\nCelsius Holdings has delivered exceptional growth for investors as its sports beverages gain market share in the United States. While growth remains strong, leadership has not yet tapped into the company\u2019s full potential.\n\nA meaningful international expansion can fuel higher revenue growth for several years. It\u2019s possible for Celsius Holdings to catch up to Monster Beverage\u2019s market cap, and the company has a high-demand product that has the potential to become a big hit in other markets.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "As 2023 wrapped up, Russell 2000 stocks, mirroring the dynamics of small-to-mid-cap companies, showed resilience, outperforming their initial stance. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), a key barometer for these stocks, boasts over $60 billion in assets and a robust daily trading volume surpassing 40 million, setting an impressive stage for these agile market players.\n\nEntering 2024, the spotlight intensifies on Russell 2000 stocks. Despite posting a commendable 12.9% average return last year, they trailed behind the S&P 500 and NASDAQ. However, currents are shifting, hinting at a potential record run for these stocks. Their inherent volatility and higher growth prospects, juxtaposed with increased risk, make them intriguing, especially as investors scrutinize indices like the Russell 2000 to navigate the broader market\u2019s pulse and refine their investment strategies.\n\nSo, here are 7 Russell 2000 stocks poised for investors\u2019 portfolios, ready to mark their trajectory in an evolving market landscape.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFluor (FLR) A Fluor (FLR) sign at the main entrance the Fluor headquarters in Irving, Texas.\n\nSource: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com\n\nFluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR) is capitalizing on the construction boom in North America, with its share price surging by 5.92% over the past year. The company\u2019s expertise in constructing large facilities has attracted significant contracts, including a prestigious role in the second stage of BHP Billiton\u2019s (NYSE:BHP) potash factory in Canada. This deal, along with a contract to develop Sweden\u2019s first large-scale sodium-ion battery plant with Altris AB, underscores Fluor\u2019s strength.\n\nMoreover, Fluor\u2019s recent financial results underscore its robust market position. The company\u2019s revenue climbed to $3.96 billion, marking a 9.72% increase year-over-year (YOY) and surpassing expectations by $132.9 million. Impressively, earnings per share (EPS) reached $1.02, exceeding forecasts by 45 cents.\n\nThis financial health is further highlighted by a shift in its backlog, now 70% reimbursable, up from 58% the previous year.

        "content": "According to the renowned consulting firmMcKinsey the wellness market is booming. And the firm reports that consumers intend to keep spending more on products that improve their health. McKinsey estimates that the sector\u2019s annual revenue in America has climbed to an extremely impressive $480 billion and is advancing at an annual rate of 5% to 10%. Meanwhile, market research firm GWIreports that 13% more Americans are implementing measures to improve their health than was the case in 2021. To capitalize on these powerful, favorable trends, here are three top-notch health and wellness stocks to buy.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nUnlike coffee, Celsius Holdings\u2019 (NASDAQ:CELH) caffeinated drinks include large amounts of vitamins. Specifically, one can of Celsius\u2019 beverages includes 70% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C, 120% of B6, 130% of riboflavin and 250% of B12.\n\nIn my view, the fact that Celsius\u2019 beverages are infused with many vitamins, and contain no carbs or fat, helps explain its rapidly rising popularity. Indeed, last quarter, the company\u2019s sales more than doubled to $385 million.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso noteworthy is that investment bank Piper Sandlerrecently called CELH the best growth stock among consumer-goods companies. The bank believes that the firm\u2019s market share can continue to climb going forward.\n\nCelsius\u2019 healthy, popular beverages and strong outlook make it one of the best health and beverage stocks to buy.\n\nPlanet Fitness (PLNT) A Planet Fitness (PLNT) exterior in Roseville, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf course, avoiding obesity is an important means of staying healthy, as research shows that obesity increases the risk of not only heart disease, but many other dangerous diseases as well, including cancer. And exercising in gyms is one way of avoiding obesity.\n\nKnowing this, many Americans have joined gyms including Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT). And PLNT has proven adept at capitalizing on these trends, as its top line climbed 13.6% year-over-year (YOY) in Q3 2023. Meanwhile its system-wide same store sales\u00a0jumped 8.4% YOY to $1.09 billion. Moreover, the firm\u2019s bottom line jumped $10.6 million YOY to $41.3 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, in November, PLNT raised its full-year adjusted net income growth guidance to about 18% from roughly 17% previously.\n\nAlso encouragingly, in December, the firm\u2019s interim CEO, Craig Benson, bought 10,000 shares of PLNT stock.\n\nSweetgreen (SG) The front of a Sweetgreen (SG) store in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nSource: melissamn / Shutterstock.com\n\nU.S. travel trends have been slowing in recent months after Americans\u2019 post\u2013pandemic travel appetite was finally satiated. But with consumers\u2019 real income continuing to climb, I believe that restaurants will be in a sweet spot as Americans will spend more of their funds on local restaurants and less on air travel and hotels.\n\nSweetgreen (NYSE:SG), whose restaurants specialize in selling healthy salads, is well-positioned to capitalize on both the latter situation and the health-and-wellness trend.\n\nShowing that SG may indeed be benefiting from these developments, in the third quarter of last year, its revenue jumped 24% YOY, while its same-store sales climbed 4% YOY. Also importantly, its restaurant-level profit increased to $29.1 million from $19.9 million in Q3 of 2022, showing that it\u2019s heading towards overall profitability.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH). This company, which is in the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nThis company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 88.19%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Celsius Holdings Inc. Was expected to post earnings of $0.16 per share, but it reported $0.30 per share instead, representing a surprise of 87.50%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.09 per share, while it actually produced $0.17 per share, a surprise of 88.89%.\n\nFor Celsius Holdings Inc.Estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. Currently has an Earnings ESP of +14.62%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "Investors often love stock splits since they typically indicate a stock has gained enough value to warrant splitting its shares into several pieces. Let's take a look at two timely examples -- one stock split that recently took place and another that is upcoming -- to see whether or not either one makes sense for investors today.\n\nWalmart(NYSE: WMT) this week announced an unanticipated stock split in this dry season, and that's getting investors pumped about it. Walmart stock jumped after the announcement, and it could be a great time to buy.\n\nOn the other hand, Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) is down since it split its stock in November, and investors might still want to wait before they consider buying it.\n\nBuy Walmart stock\n\nCompanies offer various explanations as to why they undertake stock splits -- and sometimes, no explanation at all -- but Walmart was clear about why it's engaging in a 3-for-1 stock split at the end of February.\n\n\"Sam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates,\" CEO Doug McMillon said. He asserted that Walmart felt this was the right time to do it, given the company's \"growth and our plans for the future.\"\n\nWalmart is the largest company in the U.S. by sales, with 4,600 stores domestically and 10,500 worldwide, some of them under other names. It's growing steadily despite the complex macroeconomic environment, with a 5.2% revenue increase year over year in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 31).\n\nThat was primarily driven by strong comparable-sales growth of 4.9%, which is what you want to see for large, established companies. With giant retailers like Walmart, which have more limited opportunities for store-count expansion, investors should pay attention to how well they can generate higher sales per store. Management raised its full-year revenue growth outlook from a 5% increase to 5.5%, and it raised earnings per share guidance from $6.40 to $6.48.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart's dividend yields 1.4% at the current share price. It has raised its payout annually for the past 50 years, which means that last year it entered the exclusive category of the Dividend Kings. Walmart is a well-established company and a reliable stock, and it could be a strong anchor for a diversified portfolio. It reports its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Feb. 20, and the pending stock split is giving it some extra energy.\n\nAvoid Celsius stock\n\nCelsius markets energy drinks that it touts as better for consumers' health, and it has been demonstrating massive growth over the past few years.\n\nIn the third quarter, its revenue increased 104% year over year, but it's still a relatively small company, with almost $1.2 billion in trailing-12-month sales. North American revenue accounts for almost the entire business, but it's starting to pick up steam in international markets as well, with 56% year-over-year sales gains in the third quarter. Foreign markets present a massive growth opportunity for Celsius.\n\nThe company has now reported three consecutive quarters of net profits, and positive net income for the trailing-12-month period. Gross margin expanded from 41.8% in the prior-year period to 50.4% in Q3 due to scaling and efficiency, and operating margin was 25.4% after an operating loss last year.\n\nCelsius continues to gain traction and market share. Market data shows Celsius sales up by a triple-digit percentage while the overall energy category grew by a mid-teens percentage. It's not the top energy drink by sales, but that just means it still has tons of opportunity.\n\nMeanwhile, Celsius stock has gained 56% over the past year and trades at a rich valuation of 10 times trailing-12-month sales. It deserves some kind of premium for its incredible growth rate and sustained profitability. However, its price has been coming down over the past few weeks because the premium might be too high, especially in a volatile economy.\n\nThe company may not be able to keep up the high growth rate required to justify this kind of sales multiple. If its fourth-quarter results demonstrate slower growth or if it misses expectations, its stock could fall.

        "content": "As we enter 2024, the market is fully valued with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) at high trailing earnings. Thus, identifying growth opportunities becomes increasingly compelling. Below, we will introduce three under-the-radar stocks in 2024 poised for mind-blowing growth.\n\nThese \u201crising stars\u201d are not your typical headline dominators like the Magnificent Seven stocks. Instead, they are companies that have been quietly and diligently building their foundations. They are innovating in their markets and have positioned themselves for secular growth.\n\nEach stock has created a unique blend of innovation in a specific market niche. As a result, they have outpaced the revenue growth of their respective sectors. Due to their outstanding growth, they are just beginning to gain recognition among investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they are set to make significant strides in 2024 with exciting expansion initiatives in their pipeline. Below, we shed light on these three exceptional stocks. We highlight their journey thus far and why they stand out as candidates for remarkable growth in the upcoming year.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) Graphic of blue arrows against deep blue background headed upward\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH), the energy drinks maker, has seen a tremendous rise from its humble beginnings. Gradually, it has gained a share and now is the third-largest energy drink seller in the U.S. Yet its surge has just begun, and more revenue awaits with international expansion.\n\nThe company is already expanding internationally to capitalize on the untapped market. On January 22, it announced an international expansion drive to Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) will be its exclusive distributor in Canada. In the U.K., the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland, Suntory Beverage & Food Great Britain and Ireland (OTCMKTS:STBFY) will be the distribution partners.\n\nIf Celsius ramps up its international expansion efforts further, it will easily surpass Wall Street\u2019s 38% revenue growth expectations. Today, international sales represent under 5% of total revenues, highlighting the tremendous opportunity for this energy drink maker.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Holding AG (ONON) A basketball player makes a slam dunk in a crowded arena.\n\nSource: Alex Kravtsov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith its innovative products, On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON) is disrupting the running, training, and tennis footwear space. Despite its early success, it has plenty of untapped potential it can capitalize on.\n\nFirst, to boost sales, the company is raising brand awareness by focusing on athletes to market its premium brand image. Athletes like Helen Obiri \u2013 who won the Boston and New York City marathons wearing On\u2019s CloudTri 1 \u2013 have popularized the brand. Furthermore, the company is rolling out its retail store concepts to raise awareness about its brand.\n\nThe company also plans to expand through multichannel partners and add to its product assortment. It is expanding its geographic footprint with partners like DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS). On the product side, the company plans to launch training apparel for the gym, studio, and the outdoors.\n\nDuring the investor day in October 2023, management outlined a plan to double net sales in the next three years. Building on 2023\u2019s over 44% growth, management expects 26% annual growth over the next three years. This growth, plus an expansion of adjusted margins to over 18% by 2026, presents a compelling under-the-radar stocks 2024 story.\n\nAppFolio (APPF) Graphic of businessman running up mountain path toward red flag at peak with red arrow on path behind him\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/pichit\n\nAppFolio (NASDAQ:APPF) just had one of its best days on January 26. After a blowout quarter, the stock surged over 28%, breaking out to an all-time high. The fundamentals and solid guidance mean this stock could rocket higher.\n\nSo, what got the market excited about APPF stock? Q4 2023 earnings for this real estate and property management software platform were outstanding. Revenues grew 39% year-over-year to $172 million, bringing full-year revenues to $620 million, a 31% increase.\n\nCEO Shane Trigg highlighted the focus on profitable growth. \u201cI am pleased to announce a successful fourth quarter that caps off a year in which AppFolio increased the pace of innovation while prioritizing profitable growth,\u201d he noted.\n\nManagement also provided a rosy outlook for 2024, predicting revenues of $755 million to $765 million, at least 21% growth. They also expect non-GAAP operating margins to improve from 12.2% of revenue to between 21 and 23%.\n\nAppFolio is one of the best under-the-radar stocks 2024 to buy. It is building a leading platform for the real estate market. With impressive revenue growth and improving profitability, APPF stock will continue higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi had long positions in CELH and ONON but did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article.

Some investors accumulate promising stocks and build their portfolios around them for the chance of outperforming the market.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to time entries and exits, an approach grounded in fundamental analysis puts time on your side. You don\u2019t have to worry about how the stock price moves in one month or one year. Buying long-term stocks and holding onto them for several years can generate exceptional returns.\n\nInvestors looking for top investment stocks may want to consider these picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nWhen most investors think of social media stocks, they immediately gravitate toward Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). While the company proved many bears like myself wrong in 2023, I will be setting my sights on another social media stock that hasn\u2019t received as much attention.\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) feels like an under-the-radar stock due to falling by roughly 80% from peak to trough from 2021 to 2022. However, the stock has staged a 34% rally over the past year. The stock also has an average price target of $44/share on TipRanks, implying a 17% upside.\n\nAd revenue acceleration and profitability are two key drivers for the company. Pinterest reported 11% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth in the third quarter and increased its monthly active users by 8% YoY. Over 482 million people now use Pinterest at least once per month.\n\nBill Ready, CEO of Pinterest offered some exciting remarks in the press release:\n\n\u201cAs we lean into Pinterest\u2019s unique differentiators as a visual search, discovery, and shopping platform, we\u2019re finding our best product market fit in years. Our users are engaging deeply and we\u2019re delivering better results for advertisers through improved measurement and innovation across the full funnel.\u201d\n\nThings seem to be looking up for Pinterest, and the stock price may go along for the ride.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a sports beverage company exhibiting tremendous growth over the years. The stock has gained over 3,700% over the past five years as the company plots out an international expansion.\n\nThe firm is still expanding at a fast pace in North America. Sales increased by 107% YoY in the region during the third quarter of 2023. That is almost the same growth rate as the North American growth rate in Q3 2022. North American revenue increased by 112% YoY during that period.\n\nLooking at North American and overall revenue numbers, we can deduce international revenue. In Q3 2022, the company generated $8.7 million in revenue outside North America. In 2023, the company reported $14 million in revenue outside of North America. That\u2019s a 61% YoY growth rate in international revenue.\n\nCelsius Holdings is in the early innings of penetrating international markets. The growth rate is already high, but it can get much higher in future quarters as brand adoption grows. Meanwhile, high growth rates in North America have proven to be sticky.\n\nWatsco (WSO) Watsco (WSO) logo on the website homepage.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nWatsco (NYSE:WSO) has amassed a $15.4 billion market cap by distributing air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment. Shares are up by 30% over the past year and have gained 168% over the past five years. WSO stock trades at a 25 P/E ratio, and has a 2.50% dividend yield.\n\nWatsco has a superb dividend history and hiked its quarterly dividend per share from $2.20 to $2.45 in 2023. That represents an 11.4% YoY increase. The corporation actually jumped the gun and increased its dividend after three quarters instead of four quarters.\n\nThe company has maintained $2.45/share for five consecutive quarters, which means another hike is likely to come in the next quarter. Watsco has paid dividends for 50 consecutive years.\n\nWatsco is staying strong with a record-breaking third quarter. The firm reached record levels for sales, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Despite a busy 2022, Watsco delivered 4% YoY sales growth and an 8% increase in net income.\n\nA total of 70% of Watsco\u2019s sales came from its HVAC equipment segment, while 26% of sales came from the other HVAC products segment. Commercial refrigeration products are attributed to the remaining 4% of total sales.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in CELH.
