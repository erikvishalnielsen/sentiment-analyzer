        "content": "Axon Enterprise (AXON) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of stun guns and body cameras have returned +1.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry, which Axon falls in, has gained 5.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAxon is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.64 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.74 indicates a change of +23.7% from what Axon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Axon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Axon, the consensus sales estimate of $476.92 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +27.3%. The $1.98 billion and $2.41 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +26.9% and +21.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAxon reported revenues of $460.74 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.3%. EPS of $1.15 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $437.52 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.31%. The EPS surprise was +18.56%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAxon is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Axon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Axon Enterprise (AXON) Dipped More Than Broader Market Today",
        "content": "Axon Enterprise (AXON) closed the latest trading day at $304.72, indicating a -1.39% change from the previous session's end. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.5% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 1.28%.\n\nShares of the maker of stun guns and body cameras witnessed a gain of 6.84% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Industrial Products sector with its gain of 4.4% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.1%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Axon Enterprise in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on August 6, 2024. On that day, Axon Enterprise is projected to report earnings of $1.06 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 4.5%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $476.92 million, showing a 27.31% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.64 per share and revenue of $1.98 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.08% and +26.86%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Axon Enterprise. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Currently, Axon Enterprise is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Axon Enterprise is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 66.61. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 24.45 for its industry.\n\nWe can also see that AXON currently has a PEG ratio of 3.53. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Security and Safety Services industry stood at 2.19 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Security and Safety Services industry is part of the Industrial Products sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 105, positioning it in the top 42% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Earnings Preview: Axon Enterprise (AXON) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline",
        "content": "The market expects Axon Enterprise (AXON) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 6, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis maker of stun guns and body cameras is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.5%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $476.92 million, up 27.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.56% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Axon?\n\nFor Axon, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.16%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Axon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Axon would post earnings of $0.97 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.15, delivering a surprise of +18.56%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAxon doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should You Think About Buying Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) Now?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine Axon Enterprise\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Axon Enterprise\n\nWhat Is Axon Enterprise Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Axon Enterprise seems to be fairly priced at around 4.18% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Axon Enterprise today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $296.60, then there isn\u2019t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. In addition to this, Axon Enterprise has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Axon Enterprise generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Axon Enterprise's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 22%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? AXON\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AXON, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Axon Enterprise at this point in time. While conducting our analysis, we found that Axon Enterprise has 3 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Axon Enterprise, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Axon Enterprise (AXON) closed the most recent trading day at $317.78, moving -0.52% from the previous trading session. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.39%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.6%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 2.77%.\n\nThe the stock of maker of stun guns and body cameras has risen by 8.83% in the past month, leading the Industrial Products sector's gain of 6.64% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.43%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Axon Enterprise in its upcoming release. On that day, Axon Enterprise is projected to report earnings of $1.08 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 2.7%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $476.34 million, indicating a 27.16% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $4.68 per share and a revenue of $1.98 billion, demonstrating changes of +13.04% and +26.65%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Axon Enterprise. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. Right now, Axon Enterprise possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, Axon Enterprise is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 68.2.

        "title": "The Safest State in the US in 2024",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Safest States in the US in 2024 and in this article we will look at the safest state in the US.\n\nThe State of Crime in the United States\n\nCrime has been one of the key challenges for American citizens and the government. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), 2020 was one of the most dangerous years in decades with the number of murders rising to 30% during the year. Whereas the overall violent crime rate in the country surged by 5% during the same period. However, after 2020, the rate of crime reached a tipping point and has continued to decrease since then. As per the data from the FBI, the rate of violent crime decreased from 387 cases per 100,000 people in 2021 to 380.7 cases in 2022 depicting a 1.67% decrease during the year.\n\nFast forwarding to 2024, crime rates are following the same downward trajectory. According to government statistics, violent crime rates as a whole dropped 15.2% during the first quarter of 2024, whereas murders, reported rapes, and aggravated assaults also fell by 26.4%, 25.7%, and 12.5%, respectively.\n\nAlthough the government statistics show that the crime rates are falling, however, the citizen sentiment about the overall security situation of the country remains bleak. A survey conducted by Gallup found that 63% of Americans described the crime issue as extremely or very serious in 2023. This number was up from 54%, which was last measured by the same organization in 2021. Moreover, the same survey also found that more than three-quarters of Americans believe that crime has increased in the country as compared to a year ago. The demographics of the response further revealed that the people living in big cities felt the crime rates rising more severely as compared to those living in rural areas.\n\nAnother recent survey conducted by Pew Research came to a similar conclusion and found that around 58% of Americans believe that reducing crime should be the priority of the government in 2024, up from 47% in 2021.\n\nThe interesting question to ask here is, what describes the difference between the statistics of the government that suggest falling crime rates and the general public sentiment, which suggests otherwise?\n\nCurrently, two primary government sources administer the data related to crime in the country, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The FBI releases its annual and quarterly data on reported crimes, collected from thousands of federal, state, county, and city-level police departments. However, two issues lead to an incomplete picture of the state of crime in the country. Firstly, the FBI only accounts for reported crimes, and that too for a handful of categories of violent and property crimes, thereby missing the unreported crimes and crimes that do not fall in the categorization of the department such as drug crimes. Secondly, while the department does take data from thousands of police departments and agencies, however, not all agencies participate every year. For instance, the latest 2022 report states that the FBI received data from 83% of the participating agencies, again leading to an incomplete picture.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, the BJS relies on annual victimization surveys from people aged 12 and older. While this method does account for unreported crimes as well, however, it again falls short and captures only a handful of violent and property crimes similar to the FBI. The FBI is working on a new data collection system called the National Incident-Based Reporting System, which is expected to provide a clearer picture of crime rates based on large categories of both reported and unreported crimes.

(NASDAQ:AXON) develops and sells technology products and services to law enforcement agencies in the United States and internationally. The company is known for its Conducted Energy Devices (CEDs), commonly known as Tasers. The company also provides integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions to law enforcement agencies that enable them to capture, store, and manage videos and other digital evidence through body cameras, in-car cameras, and other related software.\n\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) has recently added a Real-Time Crime Center (RTCC) technology to its portfolio. On February 1st, the company announced the acquisition of Fusus, a global leader in RTCC technology, thereby adding this cutting-edge technology to its portfolio. The acquisition will facilitate a seamless connection of Axon\u2019s critical data sources including camera location, video feeds, and body-worn cameras to provide a real-time view of ongoing incidents and activities. The RTCC data will provide law enforcement agencies with the latest data analysis capabilities which can help identify crime trends and patterns allowing the agencies to react more proactively and curb crime rates.\n\nThe company is also extending its alliance with Skydio, a leading US drone manufacturer, to add scalable drones to its portfolio of public safety offerings. The company aims to equip law enforcement agencies with the Drone as First Responder (DFR) program. The DFR program is not only equipped to survey the crime scene swiftly but also reduces the risk of officers getting hurt as first responders. The Montgomery County Police Department in Maryland is already witnessing great results with the DFR program and has achieved an average response time of only 64 seconds, that too without risking officers.\n\nNow that we have discussed the crime situation in the United States and how companies like Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) are equipping law enforcement agencies with the latest technologies. Let\u2019s now look at the 20 safest states in the US in 2024. The Safest State in the US in 2024\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the 20 safest states in the US in 2024, we relied on a consensus methodology. We sifted through 10 online rankings to get an aggregate list of the safest states in the US. Next, we turned to Reddit to rank the safest states as per Redditor's sentiment. We analyzed 5 high engagement threads that asked people about the safest states in the US. We only selected threads with at least 100 comments. Lastly, from these threads, we calculated the total number of Reddit upvotes for each state and ranked our list accordingly. Please note that the list of the safest states in the US in 2024 is arranged in ascending order of the total number of Reddit upvotes. Moreover we have also included population figures to our list descriptions sourced from US Census Bureau.\n\nNote: This list is not exhaustive and does not reflect our opinion. The ranking is solely based on the opinions of Reddit users.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

New Hampshire\n\nUpvotes: 36,763\n\nNew Hampshire is situated in the New England region of the United States and is considered one of the safest states in the US in 2024. The state has one of the lowest crime rates in the United States, its violent crime ratio is approximately 65% lower than the national average, whereas its property crime rate is also half as much as the average of the other states. The state is considered safe not only in terms of crime but also renowned for its emergency preparedness and financial safety.\n\nThe state had a population of 1.4 million in 2023, with approximately 94% of the population being literate. The state also has good employment rates and around 66.5% of the population is employed in the labor force, above the national average of 63%.\n\nCurious to learn about other states that Redditors consider the safest?

        "title": "Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nAxon Enterprise's estimated fair value is US$295 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$309 suggests Axon Enterprise is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for AXON is US$367, which is 24% above our fair value estimate\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Axon Enterprise\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$373.4m US$523.0m US$639.3m US$743.4m US$833.4m US$909.9m US$975.0m US$1.03b US$1.08b US$1.12b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Est @ 22.23% Est @ 16.28% Est @ 12.11% Est @ 9.19% Est @ 7.15% Est @ 5.72% Est @ 4.72% Est @ 4.01% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2%  US$352 US$464 US$534 US$585 US$617 US$635 US$641 US$638 US$629 US$616\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.7b\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$1.1b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (6.2%\u2013 2.4%) = US$30b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$30b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$17b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$22b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$309, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Axon Enterprise as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.827. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Axon Enterprise\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

        "content": "Unpacking Q1 Earnings: Axon (NASDAQ:AXON) In The Context Of Other Aerospace and Defense Stocks\n\nThe end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let\u2019s take a look at how aerospace and defense stocks fared in Q1, starting with Axon (NASDAQ:AXON).\n\nEmissions and automation are important in aerospace, so companies that boast advances in these areas can take market share. On the defense side, geopolitical tensions\u2013whether it be Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or China\u2019s aggression toward Taiwan\u2013have highlighted the need for consistent or even elevated defense spending. As for challenges, demand for aerospace and defense products can ebb and flow with economic cycles and national defense budgets, which are unpredictable and particularly painful for companies with high fixed costs.\n\nThe 29 aerospace and defense stocks we track reported a strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.9%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 1.3% above consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, but aerospace and defense stocks have shown resilience, with share prices up 8.1% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nAxon (NASDAQ:AXON)\n\nProviding body cameras and tasers for first responders, AXON (NASDAQGS:AXON) develops technology solutions and weapons products for military, law enforcement, and civilians.\n\nAxon reported revenues of $460.7 million, up 34.3% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 4.3%.

        "content": "Axon Enterprise, Inc. AXON has been benefiting from strength in its TASER segment, driven by strong orders for devices and cartridge products. Stable demand for virtual reality training services also supports the segment\u2019s growth. Solid momentum in Axon Evidence and cloud services, driven by growth in the number of users and average revenue per user, is driving the Software & Sensors segment\u2019s growth. In the first quarter, revenues from TASER and Software & Sensors segments increased 33.1% and 34.9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nThe company remains committed to investing in product innovations, automation and manufacturing facilities to drive growth. For instance, AXON launched its next-generation body-worn camera, Axon Body 4. Shipment of this camera began in June 2023 and the customer response has been strong so far. This, along with the growing popularity of its TASER 10 device, led Axon Enterprise to provide a bullish guidance. For 2024, it anticipates to generate revenues in the range of $1.94-$1.99 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26% at the midpoint.\r\n\r\nThe company believes in adding complementary businesses to its portfolio via acquisitions. In January 2024, it acquired Fusus, a leader in real-time crime center technology. The combination of Fusus\u2019 real-time situational awareness expertise with Axon Enterprise\u2019s public safety technology should enable the latter to boost its product portfolio. Also, the acquisition of Sky-Hero (July 2023), an innovator in drones and ground-based vehicles, expanded Axon Air's portfolio. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 16.9% compared with the industry\u2019s 14.2% growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company has been witnessing rising costs and expenses over time. In 2023, its cost of sales soared 31.8% year over year. Also, in the first quarter, the metric climbed 44.5% year over year. An increase in raw material costs might continue to hurt its margins and profitability in the quarters ahead.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are presented below.\r\n\r\nAllegion plc ALLE currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). ALLE delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.6%. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings has inched up 0.1%.

        "content": "Axon Enterprise (AXON) ended the recent trading session at $298.35, demonstrating a +1.87% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.09%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.09%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.3%.\n\nShares of the maker of stun guns and body cameras have appreciated by 3.06% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Industrial Products sector's loss of 4.75% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 3.38%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Axon Enterprise in its forthcoming earnings report. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.08, signifying a 2.7% drop compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $476.34 million, showing a 27.16% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $4.68 per share and revenue of $1.98 billion, indicating changes of +13.04% and +26.65%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Axon Enterprise should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Axon (AXON): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Axon Enterprise (AXON) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAxon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.31, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.31 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.9% and 15.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AXON Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for AXON\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Axon here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Axon, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs AXON a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Axon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.68.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Axon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Axon.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Cutting-edge less-lethal technology will enhance safety, alongside immersive virtual reality training pilot to prepare US Marshals for dynamic real-world scenarios\n\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., June 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AXON), the global public safety technology leader, today announced that the United States Marshals Service (USMS) has deployed Axon's next-gen less-lethal energy weapon, TASER 10.\u00a0The USMS will also be piloting Axon's VR Training solution to support the deployment of TASER 10 and to provide more affordable and accessible training across a variety of immersive real-world scenarios. TASER's Axon brand includes a growing suite of connected products and services from body cameras and digital evidence management tools to mobiles apps.\n\nTASER 10 will play a pivotal role for the USMS in training and equipping Deputy U.S. Marshals in fugitive apprehension, judiciary security, and safeguarding witnesses under the purview of the Witness Security Division. Advanced capabilities of TASER 10 include the ability to deploy 10 individually targeted probes at a longer range of up to 45 feet, enabling users to create their own spread and affording more time and space for decision-making, reducing risk for everyone involved when stopping a threat. By leveraging Axon's VR Training with this deployment, the USMS will also benefit from training that enables officers to build muscle memory and train to proficiency on TASER devices without the need for extensive training time and live cartridge consumption. This deployment will ensure a cohesive approach to law enforcement operations and replace the USMS's existing inventory of TASER X26P devices.\n\n\"Protecting life is at the core of everything we do at Axon, and we are proud to support the U.S. Marshals Service in their commitment to saving lives and enhancing public safety,\" said Axon President Josh Isner. \"We have seen a clear link between improved performance and safety when agencies adopt less-lethal energy weapons and VR training solutions. This partnership will allow the USMS to immerse in realistic scenarios through virtual reality, enabling versatile training at any time and at a fraction of traditional costs. It also highlights their commitment to utilizing less-lethal alternatives, promoting accountability, training, and safety for both officers and the communities they serve.\"\n\nBuilding on the success of their\u00a0body camera program, which has significantly enhanced interactions between Deputy U.S. Marshals and the public since its deployment in 2021, the TASER 10 will seamlessly integrate with Axon body-worn cameras using signal activation. This integration enables the auto-activation of cameras when the device is pulled from the holster. This feature ensures that critical moments are captured automatically, enhancing situational awareness and accountability and is supported by Axon's digital evidence management system, which has achieved FedRAMP High Authorization for US government customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nABOUT AXON\r\nAxon is the technology leader in global public safety. Our moonshot goal is to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public in the U.S. by 50% before 2033. Axon is building the public safety operating system of the future by integrating hardware devices and cloud software solutions that lead modern policing, defense and security.

        "content": "We all know the headline stocks are running up the score when we look for stocks to buy. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), and even Carvana (NASDAQ:CVNA) have all turned in phenomenal performances over the past year that likely minted more than a few new millionaires.\n\nWhat many don\u2019t see are the low-key companies doing the hard work year in and year out that can make investors fabulously wealthy. These overlooked stocks might not be trumpeted from the rooftops, but you would be remiss not to buy them. They are wealth-generating machines and are stocks to buy today for many more years of outsized returns.\n\nStocks to Buy: Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) ODFL logo on the side of a train\n\nSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first stock to buy if you want to become a millionaire is a surprising pick: trucking company Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL). Unlike traditional point-to-point full-truckload companies, Old Dominion is the second-largest player by revenue in the less-than-truckload (LTL) space behind FedEX (NYSE:FDX). Its Freight division generated $10.1 billion in revenue last year, while ODFL produced almost $6.2 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOld Dominion, however, has been picked as the No. 1 LTL trucking company by the market researchers Mastio for 14 consecutive years. The trucker consistently comes out on top across 28 separate categories, such as on-time delivery, damages, shortages, and service.\n\nLTL companies pick up shipments at terminals, sort and consolidate them based on the destination, and then deliver freight from multiple shippers to multiple destinations.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Old Dominion Freight Lines stock has been an excellent investment. Its total return is 752% versus 239% for the S&P 500. A $10,000 grubstake in ODFL in 2014 would be worth over $85,200 today.\n\nThe LTL industry is not like the tech industry. You won\u2019t get moonshots but steady growth at about 4% annually. You\u2019ll find this overlooked stock a \u201csteady Eddy\u201d that wins the race with fewer bumps along the road.\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage.

The maker of the Taser stun gun has enjoyed even better stock performance over the past decade than Old Dominion.

Last November, I said if you only have $100 to invest, Axon would make an excellent addition to your portfolio. The stock has been up 31% since then. It remains a top pick today.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales at Axon are on the rise because law enforcement agencies demand a less-than-lethal alternative. But even more important to the stun gun maker\u2019s growth has been the sale of body cameras. In an era of accountability where protecting the public and law enforcement officers is equally vital, the use of body cameras has exploded.\n\nWhere Taser sales were up 33% in the first quarter, sensors and software\u2014Axon\u2019s body cam business\u2014were soaring 51% year over year.\n\nDemand is not letting up either, not just in the U.S. but worldwide. In addition to the devices, there are the \u201cconsumables\u201d for the Tasers and the evidence database management system for the cameras. Often purchased on a subscription basis, they create a sticky environment that keeps customers returning for more. As such, I think it is one of the best stocks to buy.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nAnother surprise pick for minting millionaires is Deckers Outdoor (NASDAQ:DECK). Who knew Uggs would have such staying power? They generated $2.2 billion in sales last year, a 16% increase from the year before. Yet as powerful a brand as the footwear remains, Decker\u2019s fastest-growing brand is its Hoka running shoes. They generated $1.8 billion in sales last year, up 28% year-over-year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Hoka sales accelerated their growth spurt, surging 34% and surpassing Ugg with $533 million in sales. Ugg notched $361 million in sales for the period, a 15% increase.\n\nDecker found a new life for Uggs with the extreme popularity of TikTok and influencers wearing the brand. Direct-to-consumer sales now account for 43% of the total, up from less than a third a decade ago.\n\nOver the last 10 years, Decker Outdoor stock generated returns of 1,160% for investors, meaning $10,000 invested in the footwear stock would be worth $126,000 today. Look for the Ugg maker to keep kicking it higher in the coming decade.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Axon and Skydio partner to deliver scalable drone offering for public safety, including Drone as First Responder solution",
        "content": "Industry leaders join forces to bring technology and services to advance rapid incident response,\u00a0augment resource allocation, and improve officer and community safety\n\nSAN\u00a0MATEO, Calif. and SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., June 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AXON), the global public safety technology leader, and Skydio,\u00a0the leading U.S. drone manufacturer and the world leader in autonomous flight, announced today the launch of an end-to-end offering for drones in public safety, including a scalable Drone as First Responder (DFR) solution. TASER's Axon brand includes a growing suite of connected products and services from body cameras and digital evidence management tools to mobiles apps.\n\nDrone as First Responder allows agencies to deploy remotely piloted drones to emergency calls, often arriving before ground units and providing real-time situational awareness to multiple stakeholders from a safe vantage point.\u00a0DFR has the ability to significantly improve incident response time, enable safer response strategies for officers and the community, and optimize resource allocation. Drones in public safety also support scenarios such as locating suspects and missing persons, de-risking vehicle stops, documenting incident scenes, and collecting evidence. A successful DFR program can provide critical information across an agency's operation or joint task force that can help de-escalate incidents and make the community safer.\n\nThis expanded alliance brings together\u00a0Skydio's leading drone technology with Axon's comprehensive suite of products for public safety, to make the promise of DFR a reality for agencies across the country. The offering includes U.S.-made autonomous drones, onsite docking stations, and integrated flight control software from Skydio; real-time operations, real-time crime center (RTCC) capabilities and evidence management from Axon, as well as fleet and program management through Axon Air Powered by DroneSense; and airspace awareness and deconfliction from Dedrone's innovative technology that enables DFR beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) without the need for visual observers. Enhancing accessibility to BVLOS operations will help to scale the benefits of DFR to more communities and use cases and, in the future, will further enable applications beyond the public safety sector.\n\n\"Drones are the future of public safety. If we can provide first responders more time, more information and, effectively, more resources, we can drastically improve the way they protect our communities,\" said Axon Founder and Chief Executive Officer Rick Smith. \"Skydio is the best drone technology partner to support our customers to further realize the value of DFR and will be a key component to our ultimate goal of protecting more lives in more places, including those of our officers.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Skydio's mission to make the world more productive and safe through autonomous flight is perfectly matched with Axon's mission to protect life,\" said Skydio Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Adam Bry. \"This is an exciting time for drones in public safety, as their impact expands from smaller, specialized teams to fundamentally transforming the nature of first response. We couldn't be more excited to deepen our partnership with Axon and bring to life our shared vision of making communities across the country, and around the world, safer.\"\n\nWith this offering, public safety agencies now have everything they need to customize and scale drones and\u00a0DFR programs seamlessly. While the full DFR offering is the ideal solution for most customers, the partnership enables the flexibility to support unique agency needs and operational requirements. Each component is available to integrate with a range of other hardware and software options to customize their drone program as needed.\n\nFor more information on the role drones and\u00a0DFR can play in keeping cities safe, read Axon's latest\u00a0blog post;\u00a0to learn more about how Skydio is innovating in the DFR space, read Skydio's latest blog post.

        "title": "Is Most-Watched Stock Axon Enterprise, Inc (AXON) Worth Betting on Now?",
        "content": "Axon Enterprise (AXON) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this maker of stun guns and body cameras have returned +1.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Security and Safety Services industry, to which Axon belongs, has lost 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAxon is expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 points to a change of +13% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.81 indicates a change of +24.1% from what Axon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Axon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AXON _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Axon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $476.34 million indicates a year-over-year change of +27.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.98 billion and $2.4 billion estimates indicate +26.7% and +21.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAxon reported revenues of $460.74 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.3%. EPS of $1.15 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $437.52 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.31%. The EPS surprise was +18.56%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAxon is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Axon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Axon Enterprise (AXON) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAxon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.31, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.31 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and two are Buy.

As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in AXON?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Axon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.68.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Axon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Axon.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 A-Rated Growth Stocks With Solid Profits to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Growth stocks paired with profits are some of the best-performing stocks on the market right now. These stocks have been the biggest gainers in the past few years and will likely keep delivering market-beating returns as long as they keep growing and delivering profits. Wall Street does not like companies with high amounts of cash burn, especially if they have no cash buffer, no matter how much growth they have.\n\nAs such, building your holdings around profitable growth businesses can help you realize market-beating returns over the long run. So let\u2019s explore seven such profitable growth stocks.\n\nHeico (HEI)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHeico (NYSE:HEI) makes aerospace and electronic products. The company delivered exceptional results in Q2 of 2024, with net sales up 39% year-over-year (YOY) to $955.4 million. This growth was driven by a remarkable 65% increase in the Flight Support Group segment, which benefited from the post-pandemic aviation boom and favorable tax policies that have spurred jet purchases.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, HEICO appears well-positioned to capitalize on the robust demand for commercial and defense aviation. The company\u2019s profitability is rock-solid, with net income rising 17% to $123.1 million. Heico has an EBITDA margin of 26.4%. Sales should also keep growing fast due to the ballooning backlog. growth stocks: heico backlog\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith shares up 35% over the past year, global defense spending ramping up, and air travel recovering, HEI can soar to new heights.\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) supplies law enforcement agencies with critical equipment like body cameras, tasers and cloud software. The company is riding a wave of healthy demand as police spending ramps up to combat rising social unrest. Revenue for Q1 surged 34% YOY to $460 million, beating estimates by a solid $19 million.\n\nThe planned acquisition of Dedrone should significantly expand Axon\u2019s addressable market in the red-hot aerospace security space. Their new AI-powered \u201cDraft One\u201d tool, which automatically generates police reports, could be a game-changer in freeing up officers to spend more time in their communities. The sales growth so far screams bullish. AXON sales growth\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith analysts projecting sales growth of 26% this year and EPS jumping from $4.4 to $6.6 over the next two years, Axon looks well-positioned for continued outperformance.\n\nKaspi.kz (KSPI) graphic showing characters on a set of oversized charts and pie graphs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nKaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) operates Kazakhstan\u2019s largest payments, marketplace and fintech ecosystem. This underrated company is poised for significant long-term growth.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, KSPI delivered impressive results across all key segments. Total Payment Volume surged 35% YOY, driving a 25% increase in both revenue and net income for the Payments division. Meanwhile, the Marketplace platform saw GMV skyrocket 62%, with revenue more than doubling and net income jumping 36%. Even the mature Fintech segment posted significant growth, as Total Finance Volume climbed 48%. The company\u2019s margins are among the fattest I\u2019ve seen in online retail. Kaspi margins\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nMoreover, Kazakhstan is an increasingly attractive investment destination, particularly after the war. The influx of Russian migrants and the country\u2019s emergence as a key re-export hub for Western goods into Russia are powerful tailwinds. With 71 monthly transactions per user and 40% total revenue growth, Kaspi.kz is capitalizing on this momentum.\n\nAnalysts project around 22% annual EPS growth in the coming years, and the stock offers a juicy 5.74% dividend yield.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard\u2019s (NYSE:MA) needs no introduction. While it may not be the fastest-growing company, you simply can\u2019t ignore the incredible profit margins. In Q1, Mastercard delivered strong results, with revenue up 11% and adjusted net income surging 16% YOY. Also, cross-border volume growth of 18% was impressive.\n\nIn addition, management reiterated their full-year outlook, which is encouraging given the mixed macroeconomic picture. I\u2019m confident Mastercard will keep steadily growing alongside the broader economy. The company\u2019s entrenched market position and continued expansion into new payment flows provide a very wide moat.\n\nAnalysts estimate low double-digit revenue growth and 16% annual EPS growth ahead. Those are very attractive numbers for such a mature business. With its 47.4% net margin and consistent execution, Mastercard is a core holding for any portfolio. Shareholders should enjoy robust returns as long as Wall Street holds the premium here. I believe Mastercard\u2019s growth and profitability make it a slam-dunk investment for the long haul.\n\nRoper Technologies (ROP) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRoper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP) provides software and engineered solutions to various end markets. With its diversified portfolio, the company is benefiting from tailwinds across multiple sectors, driving impressive Q1 results with 14% revenue growth and 8% organic growth.\n\nI believe Roper\u2019s mature yet steadily growing business model positions it well to capitalize on the increasing demand for software solutions, especially as AI adoption accelerates productivity gains industrywide. Profitability is very strong here. EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points to 40.2%, and adjusted EPS grew 13% to $4.41.\n\nAlso, management raised full-year guidance for revenue, organic growth and EPS. This should boost Roper\u2019s positive momentum further. With analysts projecting EPS to surge from $18 in 2024 to $67 by 2033, I see a compelling long-term growth trajectory for this A-rated stock.\n\nKKR & Co (KKR) A man enthusiastically throws several dollar bills out. millennial stocks. 10X Stocks\n\nSource: Prostock-studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nKKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) is a leading global investment firm that manages multiple alternative asset classes. I\u2019m very bullish on KKR stock after the company reported strong Q1 of 2024 results, with fee-related EPS surging 22% to 75 cents. Management fees climbed 4% sequentially to $815 million, while the fee-related compensation ratio held steady at 17.5%, which was right in line with the target.\n\nWhat excites me the most is KKR\u2019s thriving insurance business, particularly its growing presence in Japan. The company is building a 21st-century Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) as its investments across asset classes pay off handsomely. With KKR guiding for adjusted EPS to double to $7-8 by 2026 and potentially hit $15 within a decade, this is a compounder trading at just 21 times forward earnings.\n\nYes, the valuation of 12.6 times forward sales might seem steep at first glance. However, I firmly believe this premium is justified. The profits matter the most here, and you\u2019re not paying that high of an earnings multiple. As KKR\u2019s AUM and investment returns march higher, shareholders should be rewarded with bountiful dividend hikes. GuruFocus\u2019 DCF model shows huge growth ahead. KKR DCF valuation\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nZscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) provides cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. While the company\u2019s margins are currently thin, I believe the stock is bottoming out and poised for much higher valuations ahead.\n\nIn Q3 of 2024, Zscaler beat expectations, with revenue growing 32% to $553.2 million and EPS of 88 cents, surpassing estimates by 23 cents. Also, management raised full-year guidance, reflecting strong ongoing demand for its Zero Trust Exchange platform. This purpose-built solution securely connects users, workloads and devices, processing over 400 billion daily transactions while thwarting billions of threats.\n\nI\u2019m particularly bullish on Zscaler\u2019s expanding product portfolio, which now includes AI-powered cybersecurity. As hackers increasingly weaponize artificial intelligence (AI), it only makes sense to use AI to fight back. Margins should expand rapidly as earnings grow. Zscaler EBIT\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nZS stock has declined 28% from February highs. In my opinion, this presents an attractive entry point. With EPS projected to skyrocket from $3 to $26 between 2024-2033 and revenue expected to surge 6x, Zscaler is a compelling long-term growth story trading at a discount. The future of cybersecurity is in the cloud.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investors in Axon Enterprise, Inc. AXON need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 21, 2024 $90 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AXON shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AXON is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Security and Safety Services industry that ranks in the Top 13% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.10 per shareto $1.08 in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about AXON right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.\n\nClick to see the trades now >>\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Axon Enterprise, Inc (AXON) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Axon Enterprise (AXON) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this maker of stun guns and body cameras have returned -11.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.4% change. The Zacks Security and Safety Services industry, to which Axon belongs, has gained 2.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAxon is expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. This estimate has changed -3.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.81 indicates a change of +24.1% from what Axon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Axon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AXON _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Axon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $476.34 million indicates a year-over-year change of +27.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.98 billion and $2.4 billion estimates indicate +26.7% and +21.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAxon reported revenues of $460.74 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.3%. EPS of $1.15 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $437.52 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.31%. The EPS surprise was +18.56%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAxon is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Axon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) has had a rough three months with its share price down 12%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Axon Enterprise's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Axon Enterprise\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Axon Enterprise is:\n\n14% = US$262m \u00f7 US$1.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.14 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nAxon Enterprise's Earnings Growth And 14% ROE\n\nTo start with, Axon Enterprise's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 14%. This probably goes some way in explaining Axon Enterprise's significant 58% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.\n\nWe then compared Axon Enterprise's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 6.6% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Axon Enterprise is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Axon Enterprise Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nAxon Enterprise doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Axon Enterprise's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

        "content": "Axon Enterprise, Inc. AXON has been witnessing persistent strength in its TASER segment, driven by growing orders for devices and cartridge products. Stable demand for virtual reality training services has also been supporting the segment\u2019s growth. Also, solid momentum in Axon Evidence and cloud services, driven by an increase in the number of users and average revenue per user, is driving the Software & Sensors segment\u2019s growth. For 2024, it expects revenues in the range of $1.94-$1.99 billion, indicating growth of 26% from the year-ago levels at the midpoint.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s investments in product innovations, automation and manufacturing efficiency are expected to drive growth. For instance, AXON launched its next-generation body-worn camera, Axon Body 4, in April 2023. With upgraded features such as a bi-directional communications facility and a point-of-view camera module option, this body camera has been generating significant demand, thus bolstering the company\u2019s growth.\r\n\r\nManagement remains focused on acquiring businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines. In January 2024, it acquired Fusus, a leader in real-time crime center technology. The buyout will combine Fusus\u2019 real-time situational awareness expertise with Axon Enterprise's innovative public safety technology, thereby enhancing safety and security for its customers in public places.\r\n\r\nAlso, the acquisition of Sky-Hero (July 2023), an innovator in drones and ground-based vehicles, expanded Axon Air's portfolio. The buyout expanded Axon Enterprise\u2019s capabilities to protect life and helped the company move ahead in its moonshot goal. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 25.4% compared with the industry\u2019s 25.2% growth.\r\n\r\nDespite the positives, AXON has been grappling with escalating costs and expenses over time. In 2023, the company\u2019s cost of sales soared 31.8% year over year. Also, in the first quarter of 2024, the metric climbed 44.5% year over year. It incurred high expenses due to business integration activities and an increase in raw material costs.\r\n\r\nAXON\u2019s extensive presence across international markets also exposes it to risks from negative foreign currency translations. A strengthening U.S. dollar might adversely impact its profit margins in locations outside the United States.\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are presented below.\r\n\r\nMSA Safety Incorporated MSA carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "High CAGR Stocks: 7 Top Picks for 20% Annual Portfolio Growth",
        "content": "Growing your portfolio at 20% per year with high CAGR stocks is difficult. Indeed, most hedge funds fail to come close to even 10%. The Warren Buffett Portfolio obtained a 9.91% compound annual return, with a 13.66% standard deviation, in the last 30 years. This is better than the\u00a0S&P 500 but below that of the Nasdaq. Anyone growing their portfolio at 20% per year would have\u00a0to significantly outperform the Nasdaq.\u00a0It\u00a0would\u00a0also\u00a0mean\u00a0doubling your money every 3.6 years.\n\nHowever, such a task isn\u2019t impossible. I have highlighted the above metrics to clarify that even if you invest in\u00a0very good\u00a0companies, it would\u00a0be difficult\u00a0to consistently achieve 20% annual portfolio growth.\u00a0You\u00a0also need to invest in more than just growth stocks for a well-rounded portfolio.\n\nRegardless, there are some stocks that can help you achieve those returns. These quality growth stocks are likely to compound around 20% annually going forward, as long as the market holds\u00a0up\u00a0their premium valuations.\u00a0A portfolio consisting only of these seven stocks will likely yield significant gains. That\u2019s as long as the rally continues.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI would still recommend you invest in defensive and dividend stocks alongside high CAGR stocks for ballast. That said, investors looking for outsized gains may want to dive into these stocks right now!\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage.

Its tasers are very well-known, and as social disorder increases, I see much more demand from law enforcement agencies in the coming years. Looking at the stock\u2019s recent performance, and it becomes clear it is one of the best high CAGR stocks to buy right now. High CAGR stocks: AXON segments\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIn fact,\u00a0the demand for its products so far has been stellar. I\u2019m very optimistic about where Axon\u00a0is headed\u00a0after the company reported their strong financial results for Q1 2024.\u00a0Revenue increased 34% to $461 million, blowing past analysts\u2019 estimates by more than $19 million. Earnings per share came in at $1.15, which also significantly exceeded projections.\n\nBeyond the impressive headline numbers, I\u2019m excited about some of Axon\u2019s transformational projects that could truly be game-changers in their industry. Their planned acquisition of Dedrone aims to enable law enforcement agencies to deploy drones for emergency response in a big way while overcoming current limitations set by the FAA.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Axon\u2019s new AI-assisted software, Draft One, also shows tremendous potential to save officers around 15 hours\u00a0each week\u00a0on paperwork and administrative tasks.\u00a0That freed-up time could be reallocated\u00a0to valuable community engagement and professional development work.\n\nI think\u00a0Axon has the potential for some\u00a0truly\u00a0massive growth over the long-term.\u00a0Axon appears well-positioned to deliver\u00a0strong\u00a0returns for investors seeking high annual returns of 20% or more. Analysts expect the top and bottom lines to grow around 20% annually over the coming years. So as long as the market premium holds, AXON stock should perform just fine.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is an up-and-coming beverage company.\u00a0This company also reported outstanding first-quarter results, with revenue soaring 37%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0to a record $355.7 million.\u00a0Notably, Celsius is among the key contributors to the impressive 47% growth seen in the entire energy drink segment. That\u2019s because the company\u2019s market share climbed to 11.5%, up\u00a0a full\u00a0point.\n\nWhile temporary fluctuations at their largest distributor created some noise, the underlying demand pattern remains robust. Celsius is executing and innovating well, with promising new introductions like Galaxy Vibe and the CELSIUS Essentials line gaining traction. Management also highlighted that they expect their best product placement gains once spring resets fully roll out to stores.\n\nIn my view,\u00a0Celsius has significant potential for growth\u00a0ahead\u00a0as the company works towards its ambitious goal of becoming the world\u2019s top energy drink brand.\u00a0That will take time to materialize, but you can ride the growth\u00a0in the meantime. You\u2019re\u00a0definitely\u00a0paying a premium for this stock, but as long as the company executes and Wall Street holds up the premium, this is a stock that can deliver 20%-plus annual gains.

This stock has been one of the most flashiest names in the market recently. Notably, HWM stock is up by nearly 95% in the past year, and I think it fits the bill among high CAGR stocks with the potential to see this trend continue.\n\nI\u2019m very optimistic about Howmet\u2019s\u00a0future\u00a0prospects. The company\u2019s\u00a0revenue hit a record high of $1.82 billion, up\u00a0an impressive\u00a014% from last year. The remarkable 23% growth in the company\u2019s commercial aerospace segment was especially notable. Private and commercial aerospace are areas that are booming, and will continue to boom, due to Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which allow these jets to\u00a0be written off\u00a0as business expenses.\n\nBut what\u00a0really\u00a0caught my eye was the stunning 21% jump in EBITDA and 150 basis point margin expansion seen this past quarter.\u00a0This company\u00a0seems to be\u00a0performing exceptionally well across the board.\n\nManagement has done a flawless job, with 12 straight quarters of robust gains in aerospace supplemented by\u00a0smart\u00a0decisions to increase their transportation market share. The company\u2019s financial position is\u00a0incredibly strong, with the ratio of their net debt to EBITDA at a record low of only 2 to 1.\u00a0It\u2019s clear that\u00a0Howmet\u2019s excellent operational execution also translates to the bottom line, as earnings per share grew 36%. The company is also deleveraging fast and could become a cash cow.\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nGiven the outstanding first-quarter results and various tailwinds from the rebound in air travel,\u00a0I believe\u00a0Howmet is well-positioned to deliver 20% annual returns.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) operates a leading online marketplace in China and abroad. You likely have heard of Temu and their bargain prices. Temu is now one of the most downloaded apps on the App Store.\n\nI\u2019m very impressed by the company\u2019s strong results reported last quarter, with revenue increasing\u00a0an incredible 131% over the same period last year to\u00a0reach 86.8 billion yuan ($11.99 billion), handily surpassing analysts\u2019 projections by $1.41 billion. This is definitely one of the most high CAGR stocks in the market right now. Analysts are bullish in their near-term projections, too. PDD stock price target\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nPDD is wisely dedicating resources to offering\u00a0more selection to shoppers, partnering with top global brands, and providing merchants with digital tools to help lower costs.\u00a0This balanced approach should support continued growth as Chinese consumers increasingly demand higher-end goods.\n\nPlexus (PLXS) Industrial stocks to buy: a person wearing a hard hat and holding a tablet while standing in front of a machine\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPlexus Corp. (NASDAQ:PLXS) provides design, manufacturing, and aftermarket services to companies in the industrial, healthcare/life sciences, aerospace/defense, and communications markets.\u00a0This stock has consistently delivered returns\u00a0that are\u00a0around 20% annually on average. In fact, the stock\u00a0is\u00a0up over 128% over the past five years, and I think\u00a0it is possible for Plexus to\u00a0repeat this performance.\n\nThe company\u2019s fiscal Q2 results were impressive, with Plexus reporting revenue of $967 million and non-GAAP EPS of 94 cents\u00a0that beat\u00a0expectations. Management\u2019s go-to-market strategy is\u00a0clearly\u00a0paying off, with $255 million in new program wins signaling robust demand and market share gains.\n\nThe company now\u00a0seems focused\u00a0on expanding margins, with a target of 5.5% GAAP operating margin (over 6% non-GAAP) by late fiscal 2025.\u00a0Initiatives to align operations and control costs are taking hold. Plexus also flexed its cash generation muscle this quarter, producing $65 million in free cash flow. I see lots of room for margins to expand. How Plexus makes its money\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nGiven management\u2019s increased fiscal 2024 FCF forecast of $100 million and plans to return excess cash to shareholders, I believe Plexus is well-positioned to deliver outsized returns. This under-the-radar mid-cap is worth a closer look for growth-oriented portfolios.\n\nManhattan Associates (MANH) cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nManhattan Associates (NASDAQ:MANH) provides cloud-based supply chain and online shopping solutions to many companies. The company is off to a great start in 2024, with first-quarter revenue growing 15% to $255 million and adjusted earnings per share surging 29% to $1.03,\u00a0both\u00a0beating analyst estimates. I\u2019m\u00a0especially\u00a0impressed by the 36% growth in cloud revenue and 14%\u00a0growth\u00a0in services revenue, which helped drive the higher-than-expected total revenue number this past quarter. The top line beat expectations by 4.6%, while earnings beat by 18.4%.\n\nEven with uncertainty in the global economy, Manhattan\u2019s underlying business fundamentals remain strong. The company\u2019s backlog increased 31% to over $1.5 billion due to increasing demand for its cloud solutions. Manhattan Associates cloud revenue\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nManhattan appears well-positioned for sustained growth with\u00a0a full\u00a0pipeline of potential new projects, over 100 implementations completed in the first quarter, and continued investment in innovation and hiring. This stock is also down around 14% from its March peak, so I see\u00a0big\u00a0upside in the coming quarters as it\u00a0makes a recovery.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven though we may no longer be in a travel boom, don\u2019t count out travel stocks just yet. Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) operates popular travel websites such as Booking.com, Priceline, and Kayak. It had\u00a0a very strong\u00a0start to the year. In the first quarter, revenue grew 17% to reach $4.4 billion compared to last year\u2019s period. Adjusted EBITDA surged even more, with a 53% increase to $900 million. Furthermore, the company beat earnings per share expectations by 43.66%, and revenue beat estimates by 3.74%.\n\nThe stock is up 129% over the past five years, and you also get a 0.9% dividend yield here. Analysts expect around 20% annual EPS growth over the next five years. If this company continues to beat estimates like this, I expect BKNG stock to deliver\u00a0well\u00a0over 20% gains annually.\n\nBooking.com recently saw a\u00a0huge\u00a0jump in the number of \u201cconnected transactions,\u201d\u00a0which are\u00a0when travelers book multiple travel needs like flights and hotels during the same trip. This connected trip option is still new, but is gaining popularity quickly.\n\nWith summer travel looking healthy so far and the connected trip feature helping to boost revenue,\u00a0I believe\u00a0Booking Holdings is well-positioned for a good year in 2024.\u00a0Room bookings over the next few months may slow down\u00a0some\u00a0due to issues in the Middle East and travelers booking closer to their travel dates.\u00a0However, as a leader in the market with improved profitability and share repurchases boosting earnings per share,\u00a0I think\u00a0any dips in the stock price present a buying opportunity for this high-quality growth stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing is quite certainly a slow-and-steady journey that resembles a marathon; patience and consistency are the keys to success. But let\u2019s face it \u2013 we all try to identify which stocks have the potential to create life-changing wealth!\n\nWhile the largest chunk of my portfolio is more securely nestled in ETFs, I also maintain a handful of carefully chosen positions that I plan to hold for a decade or more. This is fueled by the speculation that they may outperform the overall market.\n\nThe following three names feature strong growth and profitability prospects, forming quite compelling investment cases that could power strong wealth creation over the next decade. It\u2019s important to remember, that with singled-out stock, your risk exposure is higher, as there is no guarantee those companies will remain solvent over time. However, with the right picks, this can be avoided.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage. Focus on cellphone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) has consistently outperformed the market over the years, creating massive amounts of wealth for its shareholders. Yet, it may still be in the early stages of market domination. The company has been on a journey to empower law enforcement agencies with cutting-edge technology and ultimately save more lives.\n\nIt all began with their iconic Taser device, which aims to render bullets obsolete. Since then, the company has grown tremendously, offering a diverse portfolio that includes cutting-edge body cameras and advanced evidence management software. What\u2019s more, all of these offerings seamlessly integrate within its cloud platform, forming a powerful ecosystem for police departments and other agencies.\n\nTo illustrate the company\u2019s ongoing momentum, Axon\u2019s revenues between 2014 and 2024 grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.5%. Even more special is the fact that Axon\u2019s growth has accelerated in recent years. At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 63x, AXON stock is obviously trading at a premium multiple. Yet, its rapid penetration into this niche yet exciting industry likely justifies it.\n\nCrocs (CROX) The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nSource: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is one of my largest positions and one I plan to hold for at least a decade from today. The rather funny nature of the company\u2019s iconic clog shoe might make it a bit hard to take Crocs seriously as a potential investment. However, Crocs is so much more than that. The company has shown remarkable adaptability, transcending its initial perception as a novelty footwear brand.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo elaborate, while its iconic clog remains a staple, Crocs has diversified its offerings to include a wide range of styles catering to various consumer preferences. The HEYDUDE acquisition, which closed in early 2022, significantly expanded its target group. Notably, the company has been rapidly paying down the debt issued to fund this acquisition and can, therefore, resume share repurchases.\n\nThe reason Crocs has grown to be one of my largest positions lately is that its shares seem to be trading at a discounted valuation. Despite Crocs having grown its revenues at a 10-year CAGR of 12.7% while featuring industry-leading margins, the stock is trading at a forward P/E of just 11.3x. Thus, investors should have a notable margin of safety as well.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) is far from a hidden gem. Most investors likely already have some exposure to this tech giant, as it\u2019s one of the largest holdings in major indices. Nevertheless, on an individual level, Alphabet\u2019s potential for significant wealth creation remains outstanding.\n\nCritics have long voiced concerns about the company\u2019s investment case, especially when it comes to the looming impact of AI platforms like ChatGPT on its core search engine business. Yet, Alphabet has consistently delivered robust growth across all fronts lately, effectively debunking such claims. If anything, Alphabet\u2019s own AI developments have been driving strong targeting results for advertisers, leading to significant revenue growth.\n\nIn its most recent results, Google Search revenues rose by 14%, reaching $46.2 billion. Its YouTube Ads revenues saw an even stronger increase of 21%, totaling $8.1 billion. These numbers contradict the prevailing concerns voiced by skeptics. Simultaneously, Alphabet boasts one of the healthiest balance sheets on Wall Street. Its strong growth and underlying fundamentals position the stock for robust wealth creation moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis held long positions in AXON, CROX, and GOOGL/GOOG.

        "title": "Axon Enterprise, Inc (AXON) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Axon Enterprise (AXON) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of stun guns and body cameras have returned -2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry, which Axon falls in, has gained 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAxon is expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. This estimate has changed -3.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.81 indicates a change of +24.1% from what Axon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Axon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AXON _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Axon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $476.34 million indicates a year-over-year change of +27.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.98 billion and $2.4 billion estimates indicate +26.7% and +21.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAxon reported revenues of $460.74 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.3%. EPS of $1.15 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $437.52 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.31%. The EPS surprise was +18.56%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAxon is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Axon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Axon (AXON) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Axon Enterprise (AXON) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAxon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.31, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.31 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.9% and 15.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AXON Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for AXON\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Axon here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Axon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in AXON?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Axon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $4.49.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Axon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Axon may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Axon Enterprise, Inc. Just Beat Analyst Forecasts, And Analysts Have Been Updating Their Predictions",
        "content": "Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) just released its latest quarterly results and things are looking bullish. The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$461m, some 4.3% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$1.73, 283% ahead of expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Axon Enterprise  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Axon Enterprise's twelve analysts is for revenues of US$1.98b in 2024. This would reflect a solid 18% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to increase 9.4% to US$3.80. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$1.93b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.57 in 2024. There's been a pretty noticeable increase in sentiment, with the analysts upgrading revenues and making a sizeable expansion in earnings per share in particular.\n\nIt will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for Axon Enterprise 11% to US$358on the back of these upgrades. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Axon Enterprise, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$400 and the most bearish at US$254 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\n\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Axon Enterprise's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Axon Enterprise'shistorical trends, as the 24% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 27% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 2.3% annually. So it's pretty clear that Axon Enterprise is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Axon Enterprise following these results. Happily, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and are forecasting them to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Axon Enterprise. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Axon Enterprise analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nIt is also worth noting that we have found 1 warning sign for Axon Enterprise that you need to take into consideration.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Axon Enterprise, Inc. AXON reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $1.15 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. The bottom line increased 30.7% year over year despite a significant rise in the cost of sales.\r\n\r\nTotal revenues of $460.7 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $438 million and increased 34.3% year over year. The top line benefited from continued strength in Axon Cloud & Services, increasing adoption of TASER 10 driving growth in TASER devices and cartridges, and the adoption of Axon Body 4.\r\n\r\nTotal operating expenses climbed 30% year over year to $243.8 million. The gross margin declined to 56.4% from 59.5% in the year-ago period.\n\nSegmental Details in Q1\n\nSoftware & Sensors: Within this segment, Axon\u2019s Cloud and Services revenues rose 51.5% to $176.5 million. The uptick was driven by user growth and increasing adoption of premium add-on features related to Axon Evidence, real-time operations and productivity software. Axon Cloud\u2019s gross margin deteriorated to 72.8% from 73.2% in the year-ago period due to increased stock-based compensation expense related to vesting events from a one-time enhanced equity compensation program and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets.\r\n\r\nSensors & Other revenues climbed 14.3% to $105.5 million driven by increased demand for Axon Body cameras and accessories. The gross margin improved to 38.7% from 38.2% in the year-ago period supported by improvement from manufacturing overhead reallocations made in the second quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nTASER: The segment\u2019s revenues jumped 33.1% year over year to $178.7 million, driven by growth in professional devices and cartridges, associated with rising volumes of TASER 10 and Evidence & Cloud services, supported by increased connected devices in the field and growing adoption of VR products.\n\nAxon Enterprise, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAxon Enterprise, Inc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Axon Enterprise, Inc Quote\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, Axon had cash and cash equivalents of $403.9 million compared with $598.5 million in December 2023 end.

This includes investments in TASER 10 automation and capacity expansion. It anticipates stock-based compensation expenses in the range of $215-$230 million for the year.\n\nPerformance of Other Industrial Companies\n\nIDEX Corporation\u2019s IEX second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $1.88 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75.

A description of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found in our shareholder letter, as well as in the Investor Relations section on our website. Now turning to our quarterly update. We like to start-off every quarter with a video, because we think it's a great way to show you more about our business and there's no shortage of highlights to share from our team. We've got a good one this quarter. It's about five minutes. Let's pull it up. [Video Presentation] A technician in a white coat testing an in-car system on a modern military vehicle.\n\nRick Smith: All right. Thank you, Erik, and thank you all for joining us here today. I want to welcome you all to our first-quarter 2024 earnings call. We've kicked off what is shaping up to be another incredible year at Axon. You saw me talk about my vision in the video we just showed you and I'm energized by the updates we're bringing you today. First, one of the areas I\u2019m obviously very excited about is drones, robotics and aerospace security. I believe Drone as a First Responder or DFR is a massive opportunity ahead of us. We anticipate that it will drive faster response times and improved decision-making, giving us extra seconds and more information before we act in critical situations. As we push forward into this new era of aerial innovation, drones are not just helpful tools, they're becoming indispensable.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, drone tracking and countermeasures become equally, if not even more important. And we believe a critical element to enable widespread Drone as a First Responder programs. DFR programs are designed to deploy drones to an emergency in advance of human first responders, enhancing situational awareness to improve response strategies, optimizing the allocation of already limited resources and reducing the risk of harm to first responders and communities. But limitations exist that today have hindered the use of DFR at-scale. Namely, current FAA requirements mandate the presence of a human virtual observer standing on a rooftop to ensure each drone remains in a direct line-of-sight. That means operators must be positioned in relatively close proximity to the scene, usually on rooftops and operating primarily in clear daytime conditions.\n\nThat's one of the reasons I am so thrilled about our planned and announced acquisition of Dedrone. We believe Dedrone's technology solves through these limitations, allowing law enforcement to operate in low visibility conditions and at times of day without the need to maintain a human observer with a line-of-sight. The planned combination of Dedrone with Axon is a natural extension of our strategy with several tangential applications already deployed in the field, including stadium, aerospace security, along with robust military, critical infrastructure and other civilian protection applications. Another area I'm very passionate about is the realm of artificial intelligence. I believe that we will one day look back on these times as the beginning of the AI era.\n\nSee also\n\n30 Funny Dirty Things to Say in a Prank Call and\n\n15 Largest Metro Networks in the World.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

First quarter revenue growth of 34% marks our 9th consecutive quarter of growth above 25%, and we delivered improved profitability with first quarter net income margin of 28.9% and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.6%.\n\nAxon Cloud & Services revenue of $176 million grew 52% year over year, more than doubling over the last two years. Our software revenue growth is driven by both adoption of new products from our existing customers and attracting new users to our ecosystem.\u00a0Our net revenue retention remains a powerful driver at 122%, and we aim to sustain robust software growth over the longer term through disruptive product innovation.

Looking ahead, we aim to deliver improved financial performance and are increasing our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA expectations for the year. We are humbled to provide this update and share more detail, below.\n\nStory continues\n\nSelect Highlights\n\nAxon Week 2024 In April, we hosted our ninth annual user conference, combining our long-running Axon Accelerate and second annual TASERCON into one main event \u2014 Axon Week. Our largest user conference to date welcomed over 1,400 customer attendees and featured 99 breakout sessions to demonstrate the Axon ecosystem and facilitate broader conversations about public safety. Our\u00a0expanding user base was also on display, with strong attendance across emerging customer verticals for Axon. Over 20% of our customer attendees came from verticals outside of U.S. state and local law enforcement, including international, U.S. federal, justice, corrections\u00a0and enterprise.\n\nAxon Week has become one of the largest user conferences in public safety and is an exciting way to bring our customers together with our teams to share ideas, and showcase the full power of the Axon ecosystem. Each year, we also use this event to introduce and highlight new products and solution applications to our customers. Our announcements from Axon Week 2024 include advancements to our VR training portfolio, an\u00a0improved mobile app, and Draft One, which we explore in greater detail next in this letter.\n\n\"Our philosophy across all of these things is simple: Saving Seconds Saves Lives.\" - Rick Smith, Axon Founder and CEO\n\nProduct Innovation Highlights\n\nDraft One Axon's latest AI-driven product, Draft One, is a revolutionary new software tool that drafts high-quality police report narratives in seconds based on auto-transcribed body-worn camera audio. Draft One leverages the advanced power of Generative AI\u00a0and includes a range of critical safeguards, requiring every report to be reviewed and approved by a human officer, ensuring accuracy and accountability of the information before reports are submitted.\n\nWe believe Draft One is a valuable tool that will drive immediate productivity gains for our customers. Reporting is a critical component of good police work; however, it has become a significant part of the job that officers commonly refer to as \"burdensome.\" Axon found that every week officers in the United States can spend about 40% of their time \u2014 or 15 hours per week \u2014 on what is essentially data entry. Additionally, prosecutors and defense attorneys have shared that they welcome the quality improvement of Draft One reports as they can help support and accelerate the judicial process.\n\n\"Draft One is the next evolution in report-writing; as significant as when law enforcement moved from the typewriter to the word processor.\" \u2014 Captain Brian Gossard, Lafayette Indiana Police\n\n\"You come on this job wanting to make an impact. You don't come on this job wanting to write reports. So, this AI feature, I'm super excited about it.\" \u2014 Chief Scott Galloway, Lafayette Indiana Police\n\n\"My experience using Draft One really blew me away. [...] A 25 to 30 minute long report...you hit the narrative button and it cranks something out in a few seconds.\" \u2014 Officer Nathan Stoneking, Lafayette Indiana Police\n\n\"With over 27 years of experience in law enforcement, I have seen technology come and go, but Draft One is one of the most exciting innovations for law enforcement I have ever seen.\" \u2014 Sergeant Robert Younger, Fort Collins Colorado Police Services\n\nDraft One is one of many examples of Axon's commitment to innovating responsibly.\u00a0Axon conducted a double-blind study to compare the quality between report narratives written with Draft One and those without. Results showed that\u00a0Draft One performed equal to or better than officer-only report narratives across five dimensions, including completeness, neutrality, objectivity, terminology and coherence. In addition, we partnered with our Ethics & Equity Advisory Council (\"EEAC\") to rigorously evaluate word choice selection, draft quality and potential racial bias.\u00a0Input from Axon's EEAC also included setting the default experience to limit report drafts to minor incident types and charge levels,\u00a0and specifically excluding incidents where arrests took place and for felonies from the default settings. In practice, customers can still adjust from these default settings based on their specific preferences.\n\nAxon VR Training\n\nThe Axon mobile app Axon recognizes\u00a0the versatile nature of law enforcement duties, which require presence both in the field and at the station. We also recognize the benefit of providing tools to increase officer efficiency, enabling our customers to get more done regardless of where they are. In fact,\u00a0Axon's 2024 Digital Evidence Trends Report found that 41% of officers return to the station multiple times per shift to review evidence or write reports. The same report also found that 55% of officers desire a mobile app that gives them the ability to review evidence in the field. In response, we have developed the Axon mobile app, which consolidates crucial features of the Axon ecosystem into one mobile platform.\n\nThe Axon mobile app is the first mobile app combining both digital evidence and records management into the same user interface. It enhances on-the-go accessibility and efficiency, and improves the experience for each user of our products, individually. Officers can handle evidence workflows and start and complete reports from the field, all without needing to return to the station. The app also includes a dynamic dashboard that provides a clear visual of action items that require attention,\u00a0and it\u00a0allows officers to search for, review, request and maintain evidence including evidence categories, identification items, titles and other metadata. Over time, we plan to continue to build even more Axon experiences available in Axon's desktop applications and into simplified mobile applications purpose-built\u00a0inside this new unified, modern, mobile app.\n\n\"The main challenge is trying to keep up with all the digital evidence. You have to try to identify it, retain it and digest it all quickly.\" \u2014 Commander Nicholas Sanders, Albuquerque Police Department\n\nAxon believes better training will play a critical role in achieving our moonshot goal to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public in half\u00a0by 2033.\u00a0VR is a core technology powering our approach to help improve officer response and performance through more repetition, better practice in dynamic scenarios and more immersive experiences.\n\nOver the last year, we introduced all-new ergonomically accurate TASER 10, TASER 7 and firearm VR controllers\u00a0and expanded our training library to include more community engagement and de-escalation training modules. To take VR to the next level, we have now introduced Virtual Reality Based Training (\"vRBT\") Live-Action, which incorporates 360 degree\u00a0video immersions, featuring real human actors with realistic emotions and expressions, and vRBT Simulator CGI, which overlays VR training with interactive computer generated imagery (\"CGI\") elements in 3D.\n\nNow, Axon\u00a0VR Training\u00a0and TASER 10 are closely linked, and every TASER master instructor course includes VR training elements.\u00a0Before these advances, TASER trainees would have limited experience with deploying a live TASER 10 due to budgetary limits on the number of cartridges that could be dedicated to training. VR democratizes TASER training across large and small agencies, enabling our customers to deploy hundreds of TASER 10 cartridges in VR at no incremental cost. In our newly introduced TASER 10 VR Validation Course, each trainee will deploy TASER 10 probes in VR on 40 different targets, which equates to a savings of more than $1,000 in real-world cartridges.\n\nStrategic Ecosystem Expansion\n\nGame-changing acquisition of Dedrone to accelerate next-generation drone solutions Axon believes robotic security applications through drones and related technologies will play an enormous role in our mission to Protect Life. Today, Axon announced we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Dedrone, a global leader in airspace security. The acquisition of Dedrone is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second half of 2024.\n\nDedrone is one of the most widely used and reliable counter-drone systems in the world, protecting the public by ensuring drone technology is used as a force for good.\u00a0As unauthorized drone activity increases, enhanced airspace awareness and drone defense technology have become essential in ensuring public safety and national security. Dedrone can help rapidly detect, track, identify and, where permitted, mitigate drones and locate their pilots across multiple use cases both in civilian and professional security settings.\n\nDedrone's technologies are also a key resource to expanding the authorized use of drones as first responders (\"DFR\") in public safety. DFR programs are designed to deploy drones to a scene in advance of ground units, enhancing situational awareness to improve response strategies, optimizing the allocation of already limited resources and reducing the risk of harm to human officers.\n\nDedrone is another example of our execution on our investment strategy, which is geared to accelerate our product roadmap and enhance our ecosystem while building our talent base in product categories accretive to our long term growth. Dedrone follows our acquisitions of Sky-Hero and Fusus in the last 12 months and similarly complements our existing portfolio while expanding our product applications across our customer verticals. We estimate Dedrone will add approximately $14 billion to Axon's total addressable market (\"TAM\"). In total, our acquisitions of Sky-Hero and Fusus and our planned acquisition of Dedrone would expand our TAM by more than 50% over the last year from $50 billion to $77 billion.\n\nQ1 2024 Summary Results\n\nQuarterly revenue of $461 million grew 34% year over year, exceeding our expectations driven by continued strength in Axon Cloud & Services, increasing adoption of TASER 10 driving growth in TASER devices and cartridges, and adoption of Axon Body 4.\n\nTotal company gross margin of 56.4% declined 310 basis points year over year driven by an increase in stock-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP company gross margin of 63.2% increased 330 basis points year over year driven by increased mix from high-margin Axon Cloud & Services revenue and the absence of one-time items related to inventory and other cost adjustments recognized in Q1 2023.\n\nIncreased stock-based compensation expense in our cost of goods sold (\"COGS\") was related to enhanced equity compensation opportunities provided to employees with income below a certain threshold. This primarily impacted gross margin due to compensation rates for manufacturing and production employees relative to our broader employee base. We expect the total stock-based compensation expense from this program to be approximately $43 million for full year 2024. Axon is proud to set the bar for inclusive equity programs for all employees from the production line to the board room.\n\nOperating profit of $16 million was approximately flat year over year, with higher revenue offset by increased stock-based compensation expenses in our COGS. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue improved to 52.9% as compared to 54.7% in Q1 2023 and included $45 million in stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nCOGS of $201 million, 43.6% of revenue, included $30 million in stock-based compensation expense. SG&A expense of $153 million, 33.1% of revenue, included $23 million in stock-based compensation expense. R&D expense of $91 million, 19.8% of revenue, included $22 million in stock-based compensation expense.\n\nNet income of $133 million (28.9% net income margin, compared to 13.2% in Q1 2023), or $1.73 per diluted share, supported non-GAAP net income of $89 million (19.3% non-GAAP net income margin), or $1.15 per diluted share. The increase in net income year over year was primarily driven by unrealized gains related to our strategic investments, higher revenue and operating leverage.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of $109 million increased 67.3% year over year driven by higher revenue and operational leverage.\n\nBoth non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA exclude stock-based compensation expenses and net gains or losses related to our strategic investment portfolio.\n\nOperating cash flow reflects a $16 million outflow in the quarter, an improvement of $40 million year over year and in-line with expected cash flow seasonality of prepaid expenses and other payments, such as company-wide bonus payouts and commission payments tied to strong 2023 performance.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Axon had $964 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, and outstanding convertible notes in principal amount of $690 million, for a net cash position of $274 million, down $279 million sequentially, primarily driven by the closed acquisition of Fusus.\n\nFinancial commentary by segment\n\nSoftware & Sensors THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED CHANGE 31 MAR 2024 31 DEC 2023 31 MAR 2023 QoQ YoY (in\u00a0thousands) Axon Cloud & Services revenue(1) $ 176,467 $ 163,632 $ 116,453 7.8 % 51.5 % Axon Cloud & Services gross margin 72.8 % 74.6 % 73.2 % (180) bp (40) bp Axon Cloud & Services adjusted gross margin 74.5 % 75.2 % 73.8 % (70) bp 70 bp Sensors & Other revenue $ 105,521 $ 107,167 $ 92,308 (1.5) % 14.3 % Sensors & Other gross margin 38.7 % 46.3 % 38.2 % (760) bp 50 bp Sensors & Other adjusted gross margin 46.9 % 46.5 % 38.6 % 40 bp 830 bp\n\n________________ (1) The TASER segment includes Cloud and Services revenue, which is not included here.\n\nAxon Cloud & Services revenue growth of 51.5% year over year was primarily driven by user growth and increasing adoption of premium\u00a0add-on features related to Axon Evidence, real-time operations and productivity software. Axon Cloud & Services gross margin of 72.8% decreased modestly from 73.2% year over year primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense related to vesting events from a one-time enhanced equity compensation program and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. Adjusted gross margin of 74.5% increased from 73.8% year over year due to increased mix to higher margin software revenues relative to low-margin professional services. Our software-only gross margin continues to exceed our target of 80%. Sensors & Other revenue growth of 14.3% year over year was driven by growth in Axon Body cameras and accessories due to higher volumes, partially offset by lower Axon Fleet systems volumes on more normalized deployment timelines. Sensors & Other gross margin of 38.7% increased modestly from 38.2% year over year as improvement from manufacturing overhead reallocations made in the second quarter of 2023 was offset by an increased stock-based compensation expense related to vesting events from a one-time enhanced equity compensation program. Sensors & Other adjusted gross margin of 46.9% increased from 38.6% year over year due to favorable product mix and manufacturing overhead reallocations made in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nTASER THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED CHANGE 31 MAR 2024 31 DEC 2023 31 MAR 2023 QoQ YoY (in\u00a0thousands) Revenue $ 178,748 $ 161,343 $ 134,282 10.8 % 33.1 % Gross margin 50.7 % 57.1 % 62.2 % (640) bp (1,150) bp Adjusted gross margin 61.8 % 57.6 % 62.4 % 420 bp (60) bp\n\nTASER segment revenue growth of 33.1% year over year was driven by growth in professional devices and cartridges, associated with increased volumes of TASER 10, and Evidence & Cloud services, driven by increased connected devices in the field and growing adoption of VR products. TASER segment gross margin of 50.7% decreased from 62.2% primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense related to vesting events from a one-time equity compensation program. TASER segment adjusted gross margin of 61.8% was down modestly year over year from 62.4% due to higher product mix of TASER 10, which has not yet reached full scale production, partially offset by the absence of one-time items related to inventory and other cost adjustments recognized in Q1 2023.\n\nForward-looking performance indicators 31 MAR 2024 31 DEC 2023 30 SEP 2023 30 JUN 2023 31 MAR 2023 ($ in\u00a0millions) Annual recurring revenue (1) $ 825 $ 732 $ 652 $ 590 $ 551 Net revenue retention (1) 122 % 122 % 122 % 122 % 121 % Total company future contracted revenue (1) $ 7,036 $ 7,140 $ 5,819 $ 5,227 $ 4,778\n\n____________________ (1) Refer to \"Statistical Definitions\" below.\n\nAnnual recurring revenue grew 49.7% year over year to $825 million, driven by Axon Cloud & Services growth, which reflects growing demand for our high-value software subscription plans and a growing base of connected devices. Net revenue retention was 122%\u00a0in the quarter, reflecting our ability to deliver additional value to our customers over time and de minimis attrition. We drive adoption of our cloud software solutions through integrated subscription plans, which include a variety of premium software options. This Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") metric excludes the hardware portion of customer subscriptions and is normalized to account for phased customer deployments throughout the year. Total company future contracted revenue of\u00a0$7.0 billion decreased from $7.1 billion quarter over quarter due to normal first quarter bookings seasonality. We expect to recognize between 15% to 25% of this balance over the next 12 months, and generally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following ten years.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Axon's expectations as of May 6, 2024, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\n\nAxon expects full year\u00a02024 revenue of $1.94 billion to $1.99 billion, representing approximately 26% annual growth at the midpoint. This is an increase from our prior revenue guidance range of $1.88 billion to $1.94 billion. Axon expects full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA dollars of $430 million to $445 million, implying Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%. This is an increase from our prior Adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $410 million to $430 million.\n\nWe provide Adjusted EBITDA guidance, rather than net income guidance, due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting certain types of expenses and gains such as stock-based compensation, income tax expenses and gains or losses on marketable securities and\u00a0strategic investments, which affect net income but not Adjusted EBITDA. We are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of such expenses, which could be material, on net income. Accordingly, we do not provide a reconciliation of projected net income to projected Adjusted EBITDA. We expect stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately $215 million to $230 million for the full year.\n\nFull year expected stock-based compensation expense includes approximately $43 million in expenses related to a one-time enhanced equity compensation program provided to employees whose compensation is under a specified threshold. We expect this expense to be primarily reflected within COGS. Approximately $30 million in stock-based expense related to this compensation opportunity was recognized in the first quarter, in-line with vesting schedules. Because our stock-based compensation expenses may vary based on changes in our stock price or the actual timing of attainment of certain metrics, it is inherently difficult to forecast future stock-based compensation expense, which may also be materially affected by any future stock-based compensation plans, subject to shareholder approval. We expect 2024\u00a0CapEx to be in the range of $80 million to $95 million, up from $60 million to $75 million previously. The increase in our CapEx expectations is primarily a result of accelerated capacity expansion investments to meet higher demand for TASER 10. Our 2024 CapEx plans include investments in TASER 10 automation and capacity expansion, including cartridge capacity and lab enhancements and global facility build-out and upgrades, such as warehousing support for global shipping facilities.\n\nQuarterly conference call and webcast We will host our Q1 2024 earnings conference call webinar on Monday, May 6th, 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET.\n\nThe webcast will be available via a link on Axon's investor relations website at\u00a0https://investor.axon.com, or can be accessed directly via https://axon.zoom.us/j/91234146923.\n\nStatistical Definitions Annual recurring revenue: Annual recurring revenue is a performance indicator that management believes provides more visibility into the growth of our revenue generated by our highest margin, recurring services. Annual recurring revenue should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue because it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace GAAP revenue or deferred revenue, as they can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. Annual recurring revenue is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue or deferred revenue. We calculate annual recurring revenue as monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue, annualized. As of the first quarter of 2024,\u00a0in order to comprehensively cover recurring warranty revenue, we have recast our annual recurring revenue figures to include recurring TASER segment warranty revenue, in addition to the existing inclusion of recurring warranty revenue from our Software & Sensors segment.\n\nNet revenue retention: Dollar-based net revenue retention is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and expand our relationships with existing customers. We calculate it as the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from a base set of agency customers from which we generated Axon Cloud subscription revenue in the last month of a quarter divided by the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from the year-ago month of that same customer base. This calculation includes high-margin warranty revenue\u00a0but purposely excludes the lower-margin hardware subscription component\u00a0of the customer contracts, as it is meant to be a SaaS metric that we use to monitor the health of the recurring revenue business we are building. This calculation also excludes the implied monthly revenue contribution of customers that were added since the year-ago quarter, and therefore excludes the benefit of new customer acquisition. The metric includes customers, if any, that terminated during the annual period, and therefore, this metric is inclusive of customer churn. This metric is downwardly adjusted to account for the effect of phased deployments\u2014meaning that, for the year-ago period, we consider the total contractually obligated implied monthly revenue amount, rather than monthly revenue amounts that might have been in actuality smaller on a GAAP basis due to the customer not having yet fully deployed their Axon solution. For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\n\nTotal company future contracted revenue: Total company future contracted revenue represents remaining performance obligations and includes both recognized contract liabilities as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods. The remaining performance obligations are limited only to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 as of March 31, 2024. We currently expect to recognize between 15% to 25% of this balance over the next 12 months, and generally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following ten years, subject to risks related to delayed deployments, budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented below.\n\nEBITDA (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Net income) - Earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Net income) -\u00a0Earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments to strategic investments and marketable securities, transaction costs related to acquisitions and strategic investments, and other unusual, non-recurring pre-tax items that are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance (identified and listed below in the reconciliation). Adjusted EBITDA Margin (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Net income margin) \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted Gross Margin (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Gross Margin) \u2013 Gross Margin before non-cash stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP Net Income (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Net income) - Net income excluding the costs of non-cash stock-based compensation, gain/loss/write-down/disposal/abandonment of property, equipment and intangible assets; fair value adjustments to strategic investments and marketable securities; transaction costs related to acquisitions and strategic investments; costs related to the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") litigation and antitrust litigation and\u00a0other unusual, non-recurring pre-tax items that are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance (listed below). The Company tax-effects non-GAAP adjustments using the blended statutory federal and state tax rates for each period presented. Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings Per share) - Measure of Company's Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding during the period presented. Free Cash Flow (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Cash flow from operating activities) - Cash flows provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Cash flow from operating activities) - Cash flows provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding the net impact of investments in our new Scottsdale, Arizona campus and bond premium amortization.\n\nWe believe that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow excluding the impact of bond premium amortization and net campus investment are non-GAAP measures that are useful to investors and management to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash. These non-GAAP measures can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity.\n\nCaution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures\n\nAlthough these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:\n\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to the Company's GAAP financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be superior to the Company's GAAP financial measures; and these non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance with GAAP or under a comprehensive set of rules or principles proposed by a third party. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies.\n\nAbout Axon Axon is a technology leader in global public safety.

The complaint is based primarily on prior claims dismissed by the FTC without condition or consent decree. Axon denies the allegations and is vigorously defending the action.\n\nAxon has served motions to dismiss all claims and to strike the class allegations on numerous grounds, including that Axon's federal, state, and municipal customers with sovereign immunity cannot be absent class members.\u00a0Motion practice is underway on Axon's motion to dismiss and motion to strike class allegations, with rulings unlikely in 2024.\u00a0 Discovery is stayed pending these rulings.\n\nAxon has also received a recent request for information from the\u00a0Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General regarding this same consummated Vievu transaction. Axon intends to cooperate with any such investigation and work to resolve any concerns of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\nAXON ENTERPRISE,\u00a0INC.\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(in thousands, except per share data) THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED 31 MAR 2024 31 DEC 2023 31 MAR 2023 Net sales from products $ 272,048 $ 258,405 $ 219,389 Net sales from services 188,688 173,737 123,654 Net sales 460,736 432,142 343,043 Cost of product sales 151,698 125,664 107,584 Cost of service sales 48,992 42,591 31,357 Cost of sales 200,690 168,255 138,941 Gross margin 260,046 263,887 204,102 Operating expenses: Sales, general and administrative 152,669 137,106 116,567 Research and development 91,097 83,972 70,927 Total operating expenses 243,766 221,078 187,494 Income from operations 16,280 42,809 16,608 Interest Income, net 10,374 12,325 9,666 Other income, net 139,066 668 15,610 Income before provision for income taxes 165,720 55,802 41,884 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 32,502 (1,469) (3,255) Net income $ 133,218 $ 57,271 $ 45,139 Net income per common and common equivalent shares: Basic $ 1.77 $ 0.76 $ 0.62 Diluted $ 1.73 $ 0.75 $ 0.61 Weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding: Basic 75,355 75,060 72,638 Diluted 77,132 76,178 73,880\n\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\n\nSEGMENT REPORTING\n\n(in thousands) THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED THREE\u00a0MON...THS\u00a0ENDED THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED 31 MAR 2024 31 DEC 2023 31 MAR 2023 Software Software Software and and and TASER Sensors Total TASER Sensors Total TASER Sensors Total Net sales from products (1) $ 166,527 $ 105,521 $ 272,048 $ 151,238 $ 107,167 $ 258,405 $ 127,081 $ 92,308 $ 219,389 Net sales from services (2) 12,221 176,467 188,688 10,105 163,632 173,737 7,201 116,453 123,654 Net sales 178,748 281,988 460,736 161,343 270,799 432,142 134,282 208,761 343,043 Cost of product sales 86,984 64,714 151,698 68,067 57,597 125,664 50,583 57,001 107,584 Cost of service sales 1,074 47,918 48,992 1,096 41,495 42,591 180 31,177 31,357 Cost of sales 88,058 112,632 200,690 69,163 99,092 168,255 50,763 88,178 138,941 Gross margin 90,690 169,356 260,046 92,180 171,707 263,887 83,519 120,583 204,102 Gross margin % 50.7 % 60.1 % 56.4 % 57.1 % 63.4 % 61.1 % 62.2 % 57.8 % 59.5 % Adjusted gross margin 61.8 % 64.1 % 63.2 % 57.6 % 63.8 % 61.5 % 62.4 % 58.2 % 59.9 %\n\n_____________________ (1)  Software and Sensors \"products\" revenue consists of sensors, including on-officer body cameras, Axon Fleet cameras, other hardware sensors, warranties on sensors, and other products, and is sometimes referred to as Sensors and Other revenue.

        "title": "Top 5 Stocks Poised to Beat on Earnings This Week",
        "content": "We are in the second-half of the first-quarter earnings season. This week is the second busiest of this reporting cycle, as more than 1,900 companies are slated to report their quarterly financial numbers. Earnings results are so far better than expected.\n\nMeanwhile, a few U.S. corporate bigwigs are set to beat on earnings this week. A handful of them currently carry a favorable Zacks Rank. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and an earnings beat should drive their stock prices in the near term.\n\nAs of May 3, 400 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their financial numbers. Total earnings for these 400 index members are up 4.4% from the same period last year on 4.2% higher revenues, with 78.3% beating EPS estimates and 56.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAt present, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index in first-quarter 2024 are expected to be up 2.9% on 3.8% higher revenues. This follows the 5.3% earnings growth on 4.3% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2023 and 3.8% earnings growth on 2.2% higher revenues in third-quarter 2023.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap stocks that are poised to beat on earnings results this week. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOur research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings release. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the last quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAxon Enterprise Inc. AXON is thriving on the back of strength across its TASER segment, driven by solid demand for TASER devices and higher cartridge revenues. Also, strong demand for the recently launched TASER 10 energy device, which has a maximum range of 45 feet, sparks optimism about the growth of the TASER segment.\n\nThe addition of new users and associated devices to the Axon network bodes well for AXON. Strong response for Axon body cameras and accessories is also likely to drive AXON\u2019s performance in the quarters ahead.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because Axon Enterprise is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AXON in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.03 per share for AXON, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AXON, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +5.97% heading into earnings season.\n\nAxon Enterprise, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Axon Enterprise, Inc Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAxon Enterprise, Inc price-eps-surprise | Axon Enterprise, Inc Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

        "content": "Axon Enterprise, Inc. AXON is scheduled to release first-quarter 2024 results on May 06, after market close.\r\n\r\nThe company has a stellar earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 58.7%.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for Axon this earnings season.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nAxon\u2019s TASER segment\u2019s first-quarter 2024 performance is expected to have benefited from strong demand for TASER devices and higher cartridge revenues. Also, segmental performance is likely to reflect strong sales from stable demand for virtual reality training services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the TASER segment\u2019s revenues is pegged at $160 million, increasing 19.4% from the year-ago reported number.\r\n\r\nThe Software & Sensors segment is expected to have generated higher revenues supported by the addition of new users and associated devices to the AXON network. Strong momentum in Axon Evidence and cloud services, driven by an increase in the aggregate number of users, average revenue per user and software add-ons, is also likely to have driven the segmental revenues.\r\n\r\nStrong customer response for the newly launched next-generation body-worn camera, Axon Body 4, is also expected to have driven the segment\u2019s performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Software & Sensors segment\u2019s net sales is pegged at $278 million, indicating a 33% jump from the year-ago reported number.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Sky-Hero (July 2023), which expanded the company\u2019s Axon Air portfolio, is expected to have bolstered AXON\u2019s top-line performance. The consensus estimate for the company\u2019s revenues is pegged at $438 million, suggesting an increase of 27.7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nHowever, the escalating cost of sales, due to raw material cost inflation, is likely to have weighed on AXON\u2019s bottom line. The consensus estimate for the company\u2019s adjusted earnings is pinned at 43 cents per share, indicating a 15.7% decrease from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s international presence exposes it to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations, which are likely to have hurt its performance.\n\nAxon Enterprise, Inc Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAxon Enterprise, Inc price-eps-surprise | Axon Enterprise, Inc Quote\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for AXON this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here, as elaborated below.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Axon has an Earnings ESP of +5.97% as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $1.03 per share, which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. You can uncover the best stocks before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: Axon presently sports a Zacks Rank 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nHere are some companies within the broader Industrial Products sector, which according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in this reporting cycle.\r\n\r\nAtmus Filtration Technologies Inc.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Axon Enterprise (AXON) standing at $313.30, reflecting a +1.64% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.32%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.38%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.35%.\n\nShares of the maker of stun guns and body cameras have depreciated by 1.49% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Industrial Products sector's loss of 2.63% and the S&P 500's loss of 2%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Axon Enterprise in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on May 6, 2024. In that report, analysts expect Axon Enterprise to post earnings of $0.97 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 10.23%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $437.52 million, indicating a 27.54% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAXON's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.49 per share and revenue of $1.93 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +8.45% and +23.59%, respectively.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Axon Enterprise. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.41% upward. Currently, Axon Enterprise is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Axon Enterprise's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 68.62. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 20.89, which means Axon Enterprise is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nThe Security and Safety Services industry is part of the Industrial Products sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 70, positioning it in the top 28% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the last reported quarter, its earnings of $1.98 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00 by 98%.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for Powell this earnings season.\n\nKey Factors and Estimates for Q2\n\nSolid momentum across petrochemical, oil and gas, utility and commercial and other industrial sectors is expected to have aided the company\u2019s performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Also, strength in the core oil and gas markets (excluding petrochemical) is likely to have driven Powell\u2019s results.\r\n\r\nInvestment in POWL\u2019s Houston facility, which expanded fabrication and integration support for its large power control rooms, is expected to have bolstered top-line results.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $206 million, suggesting an increase of 20.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 6, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis maker of stun guns and body cameras is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.97 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.2%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $437.52 million, up 27.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.34% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Axon?\n\nFor Axon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.97%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Axon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Axon would post earnings of $0.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.12, delivering a surprise of +30.23%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAxon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry, Johnson Controls (JCI) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.75 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates no change from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.75 billion, up 1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Johnson Controls has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.74%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Johnson Controls will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Jim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0Jim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy. If you want to skip our detailed analysis on Jim Cramer's latest thoughts about the economy and see the top 5 stocks in this list, click Jim Cramer Portfolio: 5 Latest Stocks to Buy.\n\nJim Cramer in a program last week welcomed signs of an economic slowdown, saying \"finally\" he is seeing \"brown shoots\" that could signal the Wall Street that the Fed might be winning its battle against inflation. Jim Cramer admitted that \"it's been hard to parse this economy.\" He said in March when a \"steaming hot\" jobs report came, it seemed like the Fed was \"blindsided\" because it was talking about multiple rate cuts this year.\n\n\"You don\u2019t do that when the job market is booming. Anything that makes the Fed look stupid hurts its ability to maintain price stability.\"\n\nCramer Welcomes \"Brown Shoots\" Signaling Economic Slowdown\n\nJim Cramer said that just when the Wall Street was about to give up on the possibility of rate hikes, we are seeing signs of an economic slowdown. To back his thesis, Cramer talked about some examples depicting a broader cooldown in the economy. He said J. B. Hunt, the Arkansas-based transportation and logistics company, had a strong January and February but its business \"shrunk\" in March and the company's total operating revenue fell 9% during the first quarter.\n\nCramer also mentioned logistics and warehouse REIT Prologis. He said the company lowered its guidance just a month after \"coming to this show.\" Cramer was referring to Prologis CEO Hamid Moghadam's interview on CNBC with Cramer where, according to the Mad Money host, the company gave a \"bullish story.\" Cramer said during the interview the company indicated that it was experiencing weakness only in California but now it seems those problems are spreading to other areas too including Seattle and New Jersey. Cramer said part of the reason why these companies suffered is a possible slowdown in the ecommerce market.\n\n\"Because even ecommerce isn\u2019t safe and that, you can feel.\"\n\nSnap-On Inc (NYSE:SNA) was another stock mentioned by Cramer whose earnings show signs of an economic slowdown in the US following rate hikes. The tools and equipment company posted some \"really weak numbers\" according to Cramer, and he believes that's a \"genuine surprise\" from a usually reliable company.\n\nAnother surprise came from Sherwin-Williams, which indicated that it's feeling \"choppiness\" in the business. Cramer said \"anything home related\" has been quite strong until now. But following the latest numbers, Cramer said Sherwin-Williams shares got \"clobbered.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSherwin-Williams mentioned the world \"choppiness\" or \"choppy\" several times during its Q1 earnings call. Here's a comment from Sherwin-Williams CEO from the Q1 earnings call:\n\n\"While market conditions are choppy and may give others in our industry a moment of pause, let me be clear, we are not pausing. So this morning, I\u2019m going to talk as much about our results as I am about what we\u2019re doing to ensure the momentum of our company not only continues but accelerates our ability to widen the gap between us and our competition. So let me start with the results of the first quarter. As Jim mentioned, our first quarter is a seasonally smaller one and our results do not necessarily dictate how our full year will unfold. While our sales came in within our guidance, it was at the lower end of our range.\"\n\nRead the full Q1 earnings call transcript here. Jim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he recently recommended investors to buy or hold. Instead of major names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), which Cramer has been repeatedly recommending for the long term, you will see some new names in the list.\n\n11. Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nMexico-based energy company Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bullish on. When asked about Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST) in a recent program, Cramer said Mexico has changed some rules in the industry which would be \"good\" for Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST). Cramer said that he would \"actually own\" this stock.\n\n\"I think it's a good situation.\"\n\n10. Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RYTM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 30\n\nBiopharma company Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RYTM) is a latest Jim Cramer stock pick because of obesity-related growth catalysts. When asked about the company, Cramer said it's a speculative play \u00a0but emphasized that he is \"not against speculating biotechs right now.\"\n\n\"Looks like that there are so many bids, I'm willing to let a stock catch fire,\" Cramer added.\n\n9. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nCramer said that \"people didn\u2019t like\" the latest PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:PNC) quarter. But he disagrees:\n\n\"I on the other hand felt it was an enjoyable quarter.\"\n\nCramer recommended investors to buy some PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) shares now and buy more when the stock comes down about 10%.\n\n\"You'll have a terrific position that will last a very long time,\" Cramer said.\n\nCarillon Eagle Growth & Income Fund stated the following regarding The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) and JPMorgan performed well due to more benign inflation data, which the market likely interpreted as a sign that a recession is now less likely to occur. Recall that historically speaking, banks are hyper-cyclical stocks and typically will trade lower if investors foresee a recession, because recessions tend to trigger loan losses.\u201d\n\n8. Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nAxon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) makes technology and weapons for law enforcement and military. Jim Cramer thinks this company is an \"ecosystem of law enforcement.\"\n\nJim Cramer said Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) is good \"even here.\" Over the past six months, Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) shares have gained about 53%.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds reported owning stakes in the company.\n\nLike AXON, Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\n7. Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nJim Cramer recently hit the \"Buy, Buy, Buy\" button on Cloudflare, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NET), saying the company's CEO Matthew Prince \"rocks.\" Cramer said he'd be a \"buyer\" of this stock. However, the CNBC host said he's buy Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) \"slowly\" because there's a lot of \"big selling\" going on. In addition to NET, Cramer recommends Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the tech industry for the long term.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMost of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam. Some examples include: \u2022 Another example is the leading cloud networking and cybersecurity solution provider,\u00a0Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), who described market share gains and customers consolidating from multiple point solutions to Cloudflare\u2019s platform: \u201cAnd so we\u2019re the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass\u2026 that comes through in a lot of customer examples\u2026. people want to buy the entire Cloudflare, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:NET) platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that\u2019s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.\u201d\n\n6. Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nJim Cramer is recommending investors to hold Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) because of its high dividend yield. Cramer in a program earlier this month said the company has been \"mismanaged\" but he thinks Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) can \"bottom here\" because of its over 6% dividend yield.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database of hedge funds, 45 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) as of the end of 2023.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Portfolio: 5 Latest Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks Jim Cramer\u2019s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Does Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?",
        "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Axon Enterprise\n\nHow Fast Is Axon Enterprise Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nAxon Enterprise has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Axon Enterprise boosted its trailing twelve month EPS from US$2.07 to US$2.31, in the last year. This amounts to a 12% gain; a figure that shareholders will be pleased to see.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Axon Enterprise shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 7.8% to 10% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Axon Enterprise's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.\n\nAre Axon Enterprise Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nInsider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe good news is that Axon Enterprise insiders spent a whopping US$8.7m on stock in just one year, without so much as a single sale. The shareholders within the general public should find themselves expectant and certainly hopeful, that this large outlay signals prescient optimism for the business. We also note that it was the Independent Director, Hadi Partovi, who made the biggest single acquisition, paying US$4.8m for shares at about US$191 each.\n\nOn top of the insider buying, it's good to see that Axon Enterprise insiders have a valuable investment in the business. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.2b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nWhile insiders are apparently happy to hold and accumulate shares, that is just part of the big picture. That's because on our analysis the CEO, Rick Smith, is paid less than the median for similar sized companies. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Axon Enterprise, the median CEO pay is around US$14m.\n\nThe CEO of Axon Enterprise was paid just US$40k in total compensation for the year ending December 2023. This could be considered a token amount, and indicates that the company does not need to use payment to motivate the CEO - that is often a good sign. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.\n\nIs Axon Enterprise Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nOne important encouraging feature of Axon Enterprise is that it is growing profits. On top of that, we've seen insiders buying shares even though they already own plenty. That makes the company a prime candidate for your watchlist - and arguably a research priority. Before you take the next step you should know about the 2 warning signs for Axon Enterprise that we have uncovered.\n\nKeen growth investors love to see insider buying. Thankfully, Axon Enterprise isn't the only one. You can see a a curated list of companies which have exhibited consistent growth accompanied by recent insider buying.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of stun guns and body cameras have returned -4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3% change. During this period, the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry, which Axon falls in, has lost 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAxon is expected to post earnings of $0.97 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.5%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.68 indicates a change of +26.5% from what Axon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Axon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Axon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $437.52 million indicates a year-over-year change of +27.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.93 billion and $2.34 billion estimates indicate +23.6% and +21.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAxon reported revenues of $432.14 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.6%. EPS of $1.12 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $418.97 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.14%. The EPS surprise was +30.23%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAxon is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Axon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Axon reimagines report writing with Draft One, a first-of-its-kind AI-powered force multiplier for public safety",
        "content": "Built with thoughtful safeguards, Draft One saves officers one or more hours per day utilizing body-worn camera audio to produce draft police reports in seconds with greater quality and clarity\n\nSCOTTSDALE,\u00a0Ariz., April 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AXON), the global public safety technology leader, today introduced Draft One, a revolutionary new software product that drafts high-quality police report narratives in seconds based on auto-transcribed body-worn camera audio. Draft One leverages Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes a range of critical safeguards, requiring every report to be reviewed and approved by a human officer, ensuring accuracy and accountability of the information before reports are submitted. Draft One\n\nFor all law enforcement agencies, Draft One is a valuable tool that will be an immediate force multiplier for their workforce. Reporting is a critical component of good police work; however, it has become a significant part of the job that officers commonly refer to as \"burdensome.\" Axon found that every week officers in the\u00a0U.S. can spend up to 40% of their time \u2014 or 15 hours per week \u2014 on what is essentially data entry. Additionally, prosecutors and defense attorneys have shared that they welcome the quality improvement of Draft One reports as they can help support and accelerate the judicial process.\n\n\"Every single officer in the\u00a0U.S. writes police reports, often every day and normally multiple times a day,\" said Axon CEO and Founder Rick Smith. \"As we've done with Draft One, harnessing the power of AI will prove to be one of the most impactful technological advancements of our time to help scale police work and revolutionize the way public safety operates.\"\n\nAugment and amplify officers to better serve their communities\n\nPolice departments across the U.S. are understaffed. While agencies are emphasizing hiring and retention, demand to fill open roles is low. The shortage results in longer response times to calls for service and officers working overtime, which can lead to burnout and be costly for taxpayers. Ultimately, Draft One has the potential to augment and amplify officers, giving them back time to better serve their communities.\n\nDraft One is the latest giant leap toward Axon's\u00a0moonshot goal to reduce gun-related deaths between police and the public. Axon developed Draft One to positively impact the trajectory of what officers can achieve, allowing them to reclaim time for more meaningful and impactful work, such as investigations, patrol, training, wellness and rest.\n\nStory continues\n\nAgency trials have resulted in roughly one hour of time saved per day on paperwork. For every eight officers who use Draft One during their day, that translates to an extra eight-hour shift or more. When officers can spend more time connecting with the community and taking care of themselves both physically and mentally, they can make better decisions that lead to more successful de-escalated outcomes. Draft One also increases job satisfaction by helping police officers get a quality head-start on a high-volume, time-consuming task.\n\nReduce paperwork and generate higher quality reports\n\nReport narratives are written following calls for service and incidents in the community and are used to summarize these incidents within the overall police report. Draft One accelerates the tedious task of reporting like no other solution before, leveraging AI to create a draft narrative quickly. Audio from Axon Body 3 and 4 (BWC) camera footage is uploaded over LTE and transcribed automatically, so report drafts are available within five minutes of an incident ending.\n\n\"With over 27 years of experience in law enforcement, I have seen technology come and go, but Draft One is one of the most exciting innovations for law enforcement I have ever seen,\" said Fort Collins Colorado Police Services Sergeant Robert Younger. \"Our agency has been testing Draft One, and we have seen an 82% decrease in time spent writing reports. Testing Officers have also shared that the quality of their reports has improved substantially, with Draft One including statements and actions that could have easily been overlooked or missed if done manually. Draft One has exceeded our expectations and will be a huge asset to our agency.\"\n\nAxon conducted a double-blind study to compare the quality between report narratives written with Draft One and those without. Results showed that Draft One performed equal to or better than officer-only report narratives across five dimensions, including completeness, neutrality, objectivity, terminology and coherence. With higher quality and more consistent reports, the judicial system will have more clear, factual information to use to help accelerate justice when called for.\u00a0Learn more about the study, which was conducted with 24 independent experts, including district attorneys, field operations command staff and inclusion scholars.\n\nInnovating responsibly at Axon\n\nAxon's product development is driven by responsible innovation, grounded in a set of guiding principles in key areas to ensure that everything we do serves as a force for good. Axon recognizes the immense promise of ethical AI innovation and aims to harness cutting-edge AI technology to revolutionize public safety, all the while prioritizing the rigorous mitigation of biases and other potential risks. This includes building tools that preserve the crucial role of human decision-making with specific controls that keep officers in-the-loop, while significantly improving efficiency and efficacy.\n\nDraft One includes a range of strict safeguards and requires that humans make the decisions in key moments:\n\nOfficer required to review and sign-off: Once the report narrative has been edited and key information has been added, officers are required to sign-off on the report's accuracy before submitting for the next round of human review. Adheres to the audio data: Report narratives are drafted strictly from the audio transcript from the body-worn camera recording. Axon calibrated the underlying model for Draft One to prevent speculation or embellishments. Controls to ensure proofreading: Each draft includes placeholders that officers are required to edit, by either adding more information or removing the placeholder. Report drafts are restricted to minor incidents and charges: The default experience limits report drafts to minor incident types and charge levels, specifically excluding incidents where arrests took place and for felonies. With this default, agencies can get started with Draft One and gain tremendous value in expediting report writing for the overwhelming majority of reports officers submit. This allows agencies the option to gain experience on low severity reports first, then expand to more severe reports once they gain experience in how to use the tool effectively. Agencies can set a policy determining which reports are eligible for Draft One utilization, and the tool then ensures enforcement of the agency policy.\n\nAxon rigorously tests AI-enabled products to measure inherent bias in the models before they are released. Axon also actively seeks external feedback from its Ethics and Equity Advisory Council (EEAC) and others during product development, as it has with Draft One. Input from Axon's EEAC resulted in purposeful additions to Draft One's development process and resulting product, including conducting the double-blind study to measure quality and to test for bias risks.\n\n\"Rigorous testing is essential for ensuring accuracy and ethical integrity in new technologies. I commend Axon for their proactive approach in appropriately addressing the inherent challenges that may come with large language models,\" said Axon Ethics and Equity Advisory Council member\u00a0Broderick Turner, PhD. \"Axon's dedication to refining language tone to mitigate biases, while leveraging technology for good is crucial for fostering an equitable society. I'm inspired to continue partnering with them to promote continuous improvement and innovation in public safety and believe their commitment to mitigate unintended consequences through bias testing and appropriate safeguards is the key to innovating responsibly.\"\n\nDraft One is available today in the\u00a0U.S. as part of the Axon ecosystem and works for Axon body-worn camera and Axon Evidence customers, with even easier and more seamless insertion into Axon Records incident reports. For agencies not yet using Axon Records, the generated reports can be easily inserted into their current RMS. Data is always secured within the Axon network, where transcripts and reports maintain agency security controls. Axon unveiled this latest technology innovation at its leading public safety technology and training conference, Axon Week.

        "title": "Will Axon (AXON) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Axon Enterprise (AXON), which belongs to the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this maker of stun guns and body cameras has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 32.22%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Axon came out with earnings of $1.12 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.86 per share, representing a surprise of 30.23%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.02 per share, delivering a surprise of 34.21%.\n\nFor Axon, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nAxon has an Earnings ESP of +5.97% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These Are Likely the Next Once-in-a-Generation Tech Stocks to Buy",
        "content": "The massive growth of Nvidia undoubtedly caught many investors by surprise last year. As ChatGPT redefined the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), the lead designer of AI chips jumped to the forefront of investor portfolios, generating growth and returns rarely matched in the market.\n\nWhile such returns are uncommon, Nvidia will likely not be the only success story, meaning other tech stocks could also produce \"once-in-a-generation\" growth as they stage recoveries.\n\nAsking different investors can also increase the odds of finding such stocks, and three Motley Fool contributors suggest that PalantirTechnologies (NYSE: PLTR), Axon(NASDAQ: AXON), and Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) could become such investment opportunities.\n\nPalantir looks to have many years of growth ahead\n\nJake Lerch (Palantir Technologies): What makes for a once-in-a-generation stock buying opportunity? For me, the most important factor is a secular growth story. And today, nothing fits that bill better than the rise of artificial intelligence. So it should come as no surprise that my pick is an AI stock: Palantir Technologies.\n\nPalantir specializes in AI-driven data analysis and pattern recognition. Through its software platforms, Palantir can help various organizations achieve very different ends. On the one hand, it could help law enforcement track and apprehend cybercriminals. On the other, it might assist healthcare organizations deliver better outcomes to patients.\n\nIn short, almost every organization today could benefit from its products in some capacity. Moreover, AI is only getting better. As it improves, the results it can deliver will also scale -- making Palantir's products even more appealing to organizations looking to increase revenue, cut costs, or improve customer satisfaction.\n\nBest of all for potential investors, Palantir remains in the early stages of its life cycle. The company got its start partnering with governmental organizations -- law enforcement, national security agencies, and military branches. Recently, however, Palantir's commercial customer base has expanded.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2023), Palantir reported commercial revenue of $284 million -- up 32% from a year earlier and representing 47% of its overall sales. American-based commercial revenue grew even faster -- 70% year over year.\n\nTo sum up, American companies are flocking to Palantir. Yet, the company still has ample room to grow -- a fantastic combination for investors.\n\nAxon is using technology to benefit society\n\nJustin Pope (Axon Enterprise): Years from now, investors may look back at Axon as a generational company that hid in plain sight. The company started with Tasers but has evolved into a full-fledged technology business offering cloud-based solutions for law enforcement.\n\nIn addition to non-lethal weapons, Axon sells body cameras and cloud-based software for evidence management and law enforcement operations. These products help protect law enforcement and citizens, ensuring accountability from all parties.\n\nAxon's revenue has grown virtually uninterrupted for years, benefiting from dependable government budgets: AXON Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nToday, Axon has over 17,000 customers, and the business boasts a 122% net revenue retention rate, meaning that solid growth is baked into the business even without it acquiring new customers.\n\nThe stock has already been a big winner. Shares have returned a staggering 54,000% over their lifetime. Axon could continue to deliver. The business still does \"just\" $1.5 billion in annual revenue.\n\nManagement estimates that its current addressable market is $63 billion, leaving a clear opportunity for growth over the coming decade and beyond.\n\nE-commerce conglomerate Sea Limited appears to be headed for smoother waters\n\nWill Healy(Sea Limited): Considering the successes of Amazon and MercadoLibre, e-commerce conglomerates have become a source of outsize investor returns. As these e-commerce companies branched out into tech-based businesses, they leveraged their names and frequently-visited websites into multiple sources of revenue.\n\nFortunately, investors who missed out on these companies may have an opportunity in Sea Limited. Sea Limited started as gaming company Garena but since branched out into Shopee e-commerce and a fintech arm, SeaMoney.\n\nSea operates in the often-forgotten Southeast Asian market. Its core markets in that region constitute an addressable market of more than 630 million people, nearly double the population of the U.S.\n\nAlso, the stock is down by around 85% from its 2021 high. Garena's loss of Free Fire in the Indian market and Shopee's missteps in Europe and Latin America led to a massive sell-off in the stock.\n\nHowever, Shopee has refocused on Southeast Asia, announcing on the fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call that it is investing heavily in logistics in its home region to bolster its competitive advantage. Also, Garena has addressed security concerns and appears close to regaining approval to operate in India.\n\nRecovery in gaming could be game-changing for Sea Limited. In 2023, its revenue of $13 billion grew 5%. Nonetheless, Shopee's revenue rose 24% during that time, while SeaMoney experienced a 44% increase. Thus, reversing the 44% revenue decline in Garena would likely bring back massive growth on a companywide basis.\n\nMoreover, Sea earned $163 million in net income in 2023, its first yearly profit and a milestone that increases its appeal as an investment. Analysts expect Sea to build on that growth, forecasting an earnings increase of 116% this year and a 159% profit surge in 2025.\n\nAssuming those forecasts come to pass, such improvements could bring about a dramatic recovery in Sea Limited stock, bringing investors to the forefront of the massive and potentially lucrative Southeast Asian market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "20 Universities with the Largest Police Departments in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the 20 universities with the largest police departments in the US. If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of university police, you can directly go to the 5 Universities with the Largest Police Departments in the US.\n\nCampus Police - An Overview\n\nAccording to a 2018 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 25,000 full-time sworn officers were serving public buildings and facilities in the US. Almost half of these, 13,000, worked for one of the 510 campus police departments functioning in 4-year public universities and colleges nationwide. There were also 303 police departments serving police districts, which collectively employ 5,600 full-time sworn officers. Previously, in 2012, the Bureau had also reported that almost 75% of American college campuses had their own police department. This is the latest figure available from the department. However, data aside, the presence of law enforcement agencies on a university campus has been a topic of contention for long. While reservations have been sounded out for a long time, the \u2018Cops Off Campus\u2019 Coalition formalized itself in the summer of 2020 after reports of police brutality increased around the country, according to the Coalition\u2019s official website.\n\nAccording to the Coalition, campuses across North America have historically increased budgets for their police departments. This is supported by recent as well as old figures. On February 28, 2024, FOX 5 Atlanta reported that the University of Georgia had announced an investment of $7.3 million into improving campus safety, 20% of which had been allotted to the UGA Police Department. According to data by Longwood University, its campus security operational budget has increased 83% since 2012, with $1.3 million being awarded in additional funding. The number of full-time officers per student has seen a 24% increase since 2015. A Bureau of Justice Statistics report released in January 2015 mentioned that from 2005 to 2012, there had been a 16% increase in full-time campus law enforcement employment. In contrast, student enrollment had only grown by 11% during the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe BJS report further elaborates that 94% of all sworn officers carry guns, 94% carry chemical or pepper spray, and 93% carry batons. Thus, the money isn\u2019t just spent on hiring more officers but also on equipping them with the tools considered necessary for crime prevention or investigation. However, the Coalition believes funds from this area can be invested in education, housing, and mental healthcare instead. Before the coalition existed formally, there were still those asking for the removal of armed campus police. In 2018, an officer from the University of Chicago Police Department shot an undergraduate student, as reported by the Chicago Tribune. This led to the students mobilizing to form a #CareNotCops Chapter on their campus, asking for police reform. The efforts have continued even after the Coalition. On February 8, 2023, The Stanford Daily reported that students had been rallying and protesting on campus, asking for the campus police to be abolished. The protest started after an officer of the university\u2019s police department had pointed his gun at a black man during a traffic stop. You can also take a look at 20 Countries that Spend the Most on Education.\n\nAre The Students Safer?\n\nThe question of whether the investment in campus police is necessary comes down to whether their presence makes a difference. A 2022 study by East Tennessee State University found that on a scale of 1 to 5, students had a mean satisfaction of 3.27 with the visibility of public safety officers on campus. Other security variables, such as mass notification systems (3.84) and ID-card restricted areas (3.77), presented higher values of average satisfaction. A 2014 study by Dennis E. Gregory and Chad Patton surveyed 11,161 community college students from Virginia. It discovered that while there was a slight difference between the safety perception of students on campuses with police as compared to those without, it was not significant. The campus that was perceived as the safest by its students had employed only one part-time security guard, that too during the evening hours. Thus, the study concluded that instead of making heavy investments in entire departments, campuses must make an individual analysis of the particular security requirements of their students.\n\nThe Need and The Solution\n\nOn one side, we have students and community members pushing to defund campus police departments; on the other, some wish for them to be strengthened. According to a FOX 5 Atlanta article, published on February 26, UGA\u2019s decision to invest more in security measures came in light of a student\u2019s murder on campus. After Laken Hope Riley\u2019s death, a student-led petition for blue light emergency call boxes received 25,000 signatures. If students and parents find campuses unsafe, it\u2019s only natural for them to demand better security measures. Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON), a company providing products and solutions for law enforcement, has pointed out in an article that campus police have a higher focus on crime prevention, safety training, medical emergency response, and peacekeeping, much of which can be done without carrying firearms.\n\nA critical tool that can benefit campus police in this scenario is a body-worn camera, such as those created by Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON). On January 25, 2024, Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) announced the release of Axon Body Workforce, its latest body-worn camera for retail workers and healthcare providers. Early trials of these cameras showcased a 50% decrease in incident escalations, showcasing that they could be utilized for an effective de-escalation strategy, thus also making them valuable for a critical department like university police.\n\nIn addition, universities can focus on investing more in other security tools, such as an emergency notification system. Everbridge, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVBG) is a company that provides this system, which can be utilized to inform students and faculty members of critical events. Within the Everbridge, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVBG) mass notification system, information can be sent through as many as 25 paths, including texts, emails, desktop alerts, app notifications, and voice calls. According to Everbridge, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVBG) 6,500 organizations around the globe utilize this system, including DePaul University and the Azusa Pacific University in the United States.\n\nJohnson Controls International PLC (NYSE:JCI) is another company providing security solutions to universities that go beyond firearms. Their security solutions include video surveillance, emergency preparedness, mass notifications, and intrusion detection. The Johnson Controls International PLC (NYSE:JCI) emergency communications system has been employed by the Missouri Southern State University for decades. Since 1972, the university has worked closely with SimplexGrinnell, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls International PLC (NYSE:JCI), to create a unique emergency communication system suited to its particular needs. Public speaker arrays with powers of 1200-1600 watts have been placed throughout the campus to broadcast essential information whenever required.\n\nThese companies prove that universities can ameliorate their security through several tools besides arming police personnel. However, several campuses around the United States still possess a large police department of their own, 20 of which we have compiled for this list. You can also take a look at the Academic Ranking of World Universities: Top 30 and 17 Countries With Best Universities In Europe.  20 Universities with the Largest Police Departments in the US\n\n20 Universities with the Largest Police Departments in the US\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile this list of the 20 US universities with the largest police departments, we utilized data from the 2018 Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. We shortlisted 20 colleges and universities that had the highest number of full-time sworn personnel and listed them in ascending order of this metric. Further information for each department has been sourced from its respective website. Based on this methodology, here are the 20 universities with the largest police department in the US.\n\nNote that this list does not include university police departments that did not employ at least one full-time equivalent (FTE) sworn officer. FTE refers to the total number of full-time sworn officers plus half of the part-time ones.\n\n20 Universities with the Largest Police Departments in the US\n\n20. CUNY Hunter College Department of Public Safety\n\nFull-Time Sworn Police Personnel: 77\n\nThe CUNY Hunter College is one of the universities with the largest police departments in the US, with 77 full-time sworn personnel on board. Other than general student protection, the office also puts out alerts regarding fake job offers, personal assistant scams, and social media scams.\n\n19. University of Cincinnati Health \u2013 Department of Public Safety\n\nFull-Time Sworn Police Personnel: 77\n\nThe Department of Public Safety at the University of Cincinnati works in close collaboration with the Cincinnati Police Department.

        "content": "Long term investing can be life changing when you buy and hold the truly great businesses. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. Just think about the savvy investors who held Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON) shares for the last five years, while they gained 462%. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 20% gain in the last three months. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 8.4% in 90 days).\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for Axon Enterprise\n\nGiven that Axon Enterprise only made minimal earnings in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue to gauge its business development. As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.\n\nFor the last half decade, Axon Enterprise can boast revenue growth at a rate of 26% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Fortunately, the market has not missed this, and has pushed the share price up by 41% per year in that time. Despite the strong run, top performers like Axon Enterprise have been known to go on winning for decades. So we'd recommend you take a closer look at this one, but keep in mind the market seems optimistic.\n\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Axon Enterprise will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Axon Enterprise shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 41% over one year. However, that falls short of the 41% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified  2 warning signs for Axon Enterprise that you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Axon 2023 Revenue Grows 31% to $1.56 Billion",
        "content": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nAxon Cloud and Services revenue grows 52% to $561 million Annual recurring revenue grows 47% to $697 million Annual net income of $174 million supports Adjusted EBITDA of $329 million Company projects Full Year 2024 revenue of $1.88 billion to $1.94 billion, representing 20% to 24% annual growth\n\nFellow shareholders,\n\nAxon is delighted to deliver another year of record company performance, fueled by product innovation, partnership with our customers and strong industry trends. Demand for our mission-driven product ecosystem continued to grow in the fourth quarter of 2023, and we recorded our fifth consecutive year of 25% or greater revenue growth, growing 31% year over year. We achieved this growth with a full year net income margin of 11% and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%.\n\nOur core measure of success as a company is progress on our mission to protect life. Our mission aligns our people, our customers and our communities. Together, we focus on solving problems with modern technology, pioneering new ways of thinking and taking new approaches to\u00a0complex social dynamics, driving toward our moonshot goal to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public in half by 2033. In this first year after announcing our moonshot, we introduced new technology, new modern training capabilities and new sources of improved data and analytics. We've laid the groundwork for the next nine years, and we are just getting started.\n\nOur mission and products have resonated with our customers and afford us a growing pipeline across our business. In 2024, Axon expects to deliver annual revenue in a range of $1.88 billion to $1.94 billion, and Adjusted EBITDA of $410 million to $430 million, reflecting more than 20% annual growth and continued Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from the prior year. We are propelling our growth through innovation and diversification while realizing efficiencies and leverage on our business as it scales. We are humbled to enter a new year with robust expectations for each of our product categories and customer verticals. In this letter, we recap a historic 2023 for our company and provide an update on the opportunities we see ahead, our roadmap and our progress.\n\nStory continues\n\n2023 Key Takeaways\n\nCommitment to being a Force for Good Axon's mission is embodied in our moonshot goal to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public by 50% over 10 years. 2023 was the first year in our moonshot journey, and we progressed significant advancements to help us achieve this goal, including introducing technology, new ways of training, and optimized data collection and reporting with the Axon Public Safety Gun Fatality Database. We also published our Force For Good report in November, a bi-annual update on our progress in the areas of Corporate Social Responsibility. In addition, we summarize 5 Giant Leaps we made over the last year, here.\n\nStrong financial results Axon delivered annual revenue of $1.56 billion and net income of $174 million in 2023. This represents 31% annual revenue growth and an 11.1% net income margin, supporting Adjusted EBITDA of $329 million (21.1% margin). We are delivering profitable growth at scale and improvement in our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by leverage on sales, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses. Axon continues to grow our research and development (\"R&D\") footprint to invest in several multi-year growth opportunities, and our R&D expenses grew roughly in-line with revenue. 2023 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA margin exceeded our expectations and reflect record performance for our company.\n\nProduct innovation We power our business through relentless product innovation. In 2023, years of investments materialized in two major new product launches \u2014 TASER 10 and Axon Body 4 \u2014 and a number of advancements in our ecosystem, including groundbreaking real-time communications features such as two-way voice communications and WatchMe, as well as an expanded\u00a0virtual reality (\"VR\") training suite including\u00a0all-new bespoke TASER VR controllers alongside expanded training content and more. We also reached key adoption milestones, including new deployments bringing us to over 100 agencies\u00a0live on one or more modules of Axon Records.\n\nNew customer vertical expansion Axon has diversified beyond U.S. state and local law enforcement. In 2023, we achieved significant growth in emerging customer verticals, including U.S. federal, international, justice, corrections and enterprise. A few examples of our progress include the successful deployment of Axon Records with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, two of our largest TASER 10 orders coming from international and corrections customers, and our partnership with the Government of Scotland to power its digital evidence management system across courts, lawyers, government and police. We also have several trials kicking off with our newly launched product for enterprise, including Fairview Health, where they are trialing Body Workforce with nurses as part of their commitment to patient and staff safety.\n\nStrategic investments to further enhance our ecosystem and expand our TAM Axon's investment and partner strategy is geared to accelerate our product roadmap and enhance our ecosystem while building our talent base in product categories accretive to our long-term growth. In 2023, we acquired Sky-Hero and earlier this month we announced our acquisition of Fusus. Sky-Hero is an example of an acquisition supporting\u00a0Axon in building next-generation technology in public safety that will leverage enhanced robotic security capabilities to improve situational awareness, power more effective means of response and protect life. With Fusus, Axon advances mission control, the future of real-time operations for public safety, enabling customers to\u00a0aggregate live video, data and sensor feeds from virtually any source. Even without updating our core total addressable market (\"TAM\"), which we updated last year and update on a bi-annual basis, these acquisitions expand Axon's TAM from $50 billion to more than\u00a0$63 billion.\n\nSelect Highlights\n\nProduct\u00a0Traction & Ecosystem Expansion Axon has set out to build the technology ecosystem for public safety \u2014 to enable our customers to protect life, capture truth and accelerate justice. We invest incrementally each year to consistently develop and deliver new game-changing technology while simultaneously enhancing our existing products. When our products resonate with our customers, we see strong demand and a growing opportunity set of expanding relationships, measurable through new product traction and increasing adoption of the expanding Axon software ecosystem surrounding those new products. This affords us the opportunity to further invest in new technology categories and applications, both through our continued investment in R&D and through strategic investment, fueling our future product innovation, expansion and growth.\n\nProduct highlights from this past year are examples of this strategy at work:\n\nOur two most successful product launches together in a single year The successful launch and ramp of TASER 10 and Axon Body 4 in the same year is evidence of what our team is able to accomplish.\n\nAfter over five years of development, our latest TASER device features new game changing technology, including individually targeted probes, the ability to deploy up to 10 probes, and a longer range of up to 45 feet, along with a host of other features and upgrades that make this latest generation TASER product the best yet. These are major steps toward where we see the future of this critical technology, and together they are generating unprecedented demand from our customers.\n\nAt the same time, our operational advancements are measurable in our execution in launching the product. In 2023, we shipped over 50,000 units of TASER 10 and the new product was our top selling TASER device in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"TASER 10 is now our fastest growing TASER product in history.\" \u2014\u00a0Rick Smith, Axon Founder and CEO\n\nFollowing the launch of TASER 10 in January 2023, we introduced Axon Body 4 in April 2023, which has quickly become our fastest selling body camera product to date. Axon Body 4 includes a host of advancements from prior generation body cameras, including expanded communications abilities, more points of view, upgraded camera features and more streamlined operations. We shipped more than 100,000 units of Axon Body 4 in the second half of 2023, only months after introducing this next generation body camera product to market.\n\n\"As Sheriff of Bernalillo County, I've witnessed firsthand the profound impact that the new TASER 10 audible and visual warning alert system has had on our law enforcement efforts. The innovative design, featuring a bright pulsing light paired with a loud alert sound, has significantly enhanced our deputies' ability to gain compliance from initially non-compliant suspects without the need to deploy cartridges. This technology is not just about maintaining safety; it's about escalating our approach to de-escalation. We've observed that this generation, in particular, responds strongly to the visual and audible cues of the TASER 10 warning alert. It captures their attention and conveys a clear message that they need to reconsider their actions. This tool has been invaluable in our mission to protect and serve, offering a powerful alternative that benefits both our deputies and our team and the results in the field speak volumes to the effectiveness of this approach. The TASER 10 is a testament to the evolution of law enforcement tools towards safer, more effective outcomes.\" \u2014 Sheriff Josh Allen, Bernalillo County (NM) Sheriff's Office\n\nSoftware innovation supporting multiple vectors of growth We describe our software products as belonging to three major categories: 1) digital evidence management, 2) real-time operations and 3) productivity software. Within our software portfolio, we deliver right-sized and custom subscription plans that can be configured to meet the needs of any customer, and we support customers in their journeys to build world-class public safety organizations. Most often, our customers initially adopt cloud digital evidence management licenses included with our standard product subscription plans for Axon Body, Axon Fleet, TASER, interview rooms and Officer Safety PlanS.\n\nOver time, we see customers opting to upgrade to additional product features and categories \u2014 this includes adding premium digital evidence management features, such as Axon Performance, Auto-Tagging and Redaction Assistant, as well as our real-time operations, live-streaming and two-way voice communications capabilities with Axon Respond and productivity software with Axon Standards and Axon Records. Our net revenue retention of 122% in the fourth quarter of 2023 reflects our success in selling new premium features to our existing customers.\n\n\"Best of all, as the agency continues to leverage [Axon] Respond, everyone in the agency can have a voice in maximizing the technology \u2014 officers, for example, can proactively request assistance from supervisors at complicated scenes. This is why supervisors at Las Cruces have been transparent about when and how it's being used. The more [patrol officers] know about it, they get creative and [think of] ways to use it I'm not even aware of...and then they let me know and it makes everyone better\" \u2014\u00a0Officer Benavidez, Las Cruces (NM) Police Department\n\nStrategic acquisition of Fusus accelerates and further unleashes Axon real-time operations In addition to our R&D, Axon also leverages partnerships to deliver on our product vision. We take a technology first strategic approach to reviewing potential partners and believe it benefits our customers when we can provide them more of an ecosystem opportunity. Sometimes we also see the opportunity to make minority investments in select partners to further align our goals on delivering strategic outcomes to customers. Fusus was one of those partners where we saw strong alignment between our products, we invested in them as a company, and now we're thrilled to have acquired them to more fully support our ecosystem vision for real-time operations.\n\nAn immediate benefit from this acquisition is empowering customers to securely access existing CCTV and other camera feeds from key sources like local businesses in the community \u2014 with appropriate permissions \u2014 to see events unfolding in real-time with greater context and clarity. This open platform improves crucial real-time situational awareness for our customers, while directly facilitating collaborative community partnerships.\n\nOver time, real-time crime centers powered by Axon and Fusus will safely and securely connect to an increasingly wide range of data sources beyond Axon devices, including fixed, body-worn, in-car, and automated license plate recognition (\"ALPR\") cameras; gunshot detection sensors, social media feeds and various other sensors and systems \u2014 again, with appropriate permissions. By aggregating all of this information into a single pane of glass, real-time crime centers can further improve situational awareness, reduce response times and support proactive crime prevention efforts by leveraging up-to-minute information and analytics. We enable information to be quickly and easily shared between collaborating agencies, ensuring accelerated justice for all involved, another point of expansion into additional emerging product areas for our company. We believe Fusus adds approximately $13 billion to our TAM opportunity, bringing our total real-time operations TAM to $16 billion, which we discuss in more detail later in this letter.\n\nReal-time operations is an example of Axon's product innovation driving category creation. Axon introduced live-streaming through a body camera to the market with Axon Body 3 and further advanced on our vision with direct two-way voice communications with Axon Body 4. We believe the integration of Fusus into this product category will be accretive to our long-term growth, and we saw early signs of success leading into this strategic acquisition.\n\nLaying the groundwork for a new phase of product innovation with Sky-Hero and Axon Air Axon Air is our product category that powers applications for robotic security, which we believe holds significant promise in achieving our moonshot goal, and as a driver of future growth. We think utilizing robotic systems in tactical high-risk situations to create more distance and time, two critical factors that can drastically change outcomes for the better, will become a mission-critical tool leveraged in the future of public safety operations. Ultimately, we aim to enable customers to reduce the number of times where humans are forced to face high-risk, potentially life-altering situations.\n\nAxon Air also supports use cases for drones to increase situational awareness, providing an additional point of view for an evolving incident or enabling better visibility into surveying and disaster search efforts. In crime scene investigations, Axon Air powered drones can be leveraged to uncover otherwise undiscoverable evidence to support resolution. Finally, drone as a first responder (\"DFR\") is a growing application where the utilization of drone technology can reduce emergency response times and act as a force multiplier.\n\nWe have leveraged our internal talent, as well as strategic partnerships and our Sky-Hero acquisition, in this emerging product category. Along with our partners, we are able to drive robotic security applications and ensure secure operating conditions for this future technology through highly advanced software and systems. We estimate\u00a0Sky-Hero's current products expand our TAM for Axon Air by more than $400 million to $4.5 billion.\n\n\"It didn't take long for us to realize the value of drones. Now we use them for everything. After the traffic division, detectives started using drones for crime scene documentation. Then SWAT started using them. And now, every patrol crew has a drone and pilot. We tell our people if there's a situation where you think a drone would be useful, just try it out to see.\" \u2014 Chad Karlewicz, Commander of Special Operations,\u00a0Renton (WA) Police Department\n\nUpdating TAM for our Expanding Ecosystem In the beginning of 2023, we updated our TAM analysis to reflect the opportunities we see ahead in each of our product categories, with a breakdown into the primary product drivers, including digital evidence management, real-time operations and productivity software, camera hardware, Axon Air, AR/VR training, TASER professional and personal protection. Our findings resulted in a TAM of approximately $50 billion, which we will update in full again at the beginning of 2025. Updating TAM for our Expanding Ecosystem (1)\n\nHowever, we have updated our TAM with respect to the acquisitions of Sky-Hero and Fusus. In total, these additions to our ecosystem expand Axon's TAM to $63 billion in 2024.\n\nOur efforts to build the technology ecosystem for public safety go beyond our product strategy. We are also diversifying our business by growing our presence with new types of customer profiles, or users, and by adding to our core customer base. This materializes through Axon selling into additional categories of funding sources beyond U.S. state and local governments, including the U.S. federal government, international governments, enterprises and civilians. Simultaneously, the types of customers, or verticals, who find value in our product offerings expand beyond law enforcement to include attorneys, fire and emergency medical services (\"EMS\") personnel, corrections and the U.S. military. Updating TAM for our Expanding Ecosystem (2)\n\nAs we recap our progress over the last year, we are providing a breakdown of our 2023 TAM by funding source to highlight an additional view into our opportunities. Collectively, customer funding sources outside U.S. state and local governments account for the majority of the TAM we pursue today.\n\n$15\u00a0billion in U.S. state and local governments, including more than 900,000 law enforcement personnel between sworn and civilian roles and more than 400,000 vehicles. In addition, we estimate approximately 30% of our U.S. state and local customer TAM comprises adjacent public safety customer verticals outside of law enforcement, including justice, with over 700,000 legal professionals involved in criminal justice between attorneys and paralegals; corrections, with approximately 500,000 corrections, probation, and child services officers; fire, with approximately 1 million career and volunteer firefighters; and EMS, with over 250,000 paramedics. We estimate that our acquisitions of Fusus and Sky-Hero added nearly $3 billion to our U.S. state and local government TAM. $10 billion in U.S. federal government,\u00a0with more than 2 million potential users and over 300,000 vehicles across various branches of the U.S. federal government, including the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of State, to name a few. $19 billion in international governments, where a single-country opportunity presents a 200,000 or larger potential user base and, together, the potential user base of international law enforcement and adjacencies totals to approximately 10x the user base of U.S. state and local law enforcement.\u00a0We estimate that our acquisitions of Fusus and Sky-Hero added over $3 billion to our international government TAM. $15 billion in enterprise, comprising more than 20 million potential users in the United States, including retail associates, technicians, transportation and warehouse employees, and private security professionals, among others. Our recent acquisition of Fusus nearly doubled our enterprise opportunity, adding $7 billion to this TAM, with Fusus technology helping unlock our opportunity to access fixed video and CCTV feeds within our ecosystem. $5 billion in civilian personal protection.\n\nOur TAM estimates are based on publicly available data on user counts, our estimate of in-scope users for our products over the next three years, by product and user category, and our estimated potential value of applicable products. We reference the most up to date data published by national governments, surveys and studies and proprietary information in the production of our TAM estimates.The product and vertical level TAMs shown have been rounded to the nearest whole number and will not arrive at our total TAM of $63 billion when added together due to rounding.\n\nGrowing Customer\u00a0Verticals \r\nEach year, we provide updates on our progress and activity in select customer verticals where we have directed our investment. Last quarter, we discussed our progress in U.S. federal and international, two areas that have become driving forces of our growth beyond the growth we see with our U.S. state and local law enforcement customers. As we recap our year, we are providing an additional update on corrections, a fast-growing adjacent public safety vertical, and enterprise, where our new product introductions open further applications for our technology in the private sector, including private security, retail and healthcare.\n\nThe future of technology and corrections One area where we have identified the opportunity to enable safe means of de-escalation while improving transparency is in the corrections vertical \u2014 which, as we described above, increases our potential domestic user base by approximately 50% relative to U.S. state and local law enforcement.\n\nWe introduced TASER devices to corrections customers to provide a means to safely de-escalate conflict without violence, particularly useful in a correctional environment, and have found strong new customer fit for this product. In fact, our second largest TASER 10 order has come from a corrections customer in the United States. Further, conversations during our recent participation at the annual conference of the Florida Council on Crime and Delinquency validated our strategy to drive body camera adoption in this emerging customer vertical for Axon. Body cameras were discussed as an accountability and transparency tool to keep corrections facilities safe, and our growing pipeline with this customer vertical supports our investment here. Corrections was our top growing adjacent customer vertical in 2023.\n\n\"Body-worn cameras have deterred use of force in our facility\" \u2014\u00a0 Correctional Officer, Hardee (FL) Correctional Institution\n\nIntroducing Axon Body Workforce for enterprise In January, we announced our first ever dedicated enterprise vertical product, Axon Body Workforce. This new generation of body cameras is designed for frontline workers in retail stores and healthcare facilities and adapts the same life-saving technology trusted by our public safety customers. Axon has identified applications in retail, healthcare and other areas within enterprise where body cameras are a tool to promote personal safety for employees at work. In addition to deterring and de-escalating incidents with the presence of a camera, Axon Body Workforce integrates Axon's real-time capabilities and digital evidence management workflows, allowing for quicker and more effective interventions and making it easier to act on captured footage.\u00a0We have kicked off several customer trials with this newly launched product for enterprise.\n\nThe enterprise vertical also includes applications in private security, which more closely mirror public safety professional use cases. Private security use of Axon technology facilitates collaboration between local public safety professionals and governments, creating efficiencies and improving transparency. Examples of current customer applications include private security professionals in stadiums, theme parks and other secured public spaces. Within our potential enterprise user base, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports there are approximately 1 million private security professionals employed in the United States, today.\n\n\"Public safety is about just that \u2014 people feeling and being safe in public, including while at work.\" \u2014 Rick Smith, Axon Founder and CEO.\n\nQ4 2023 Summary Results\n\nQuarterly revenue of $432 million exceeded our expectations and grew 28.6% year over year driven by strong demand across product categories. Axon Cloud software was the primary driver, with increasing adoption of our premium\u00a0 add-on features, a growing base of software licenses associated with Axon Fleet systems and expansion into new customers supporting growth in our now largest product category. Ramping shipments of TASER 10 and Axon Body 4 also supported our growth as demand for both new products continues to build. Total company gross margin of 61.1% declined 10 basis points year over year, primarily\u00a0driven by lower TASER gross margin, partially offset by a higher Sensors gross margin and increased mix to Axon Cloud and Services. Operating profit of $43 million increased 89.9% year over year driven by higher revenue and operating leverage. Operating expenses of $221 million included $33 million in stock-based compensation expenses. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue improved to 51.2% as compared to 54.5% in the Q4 2022.\n\nSG&A expense of $137 million, 31.7% of revenue, included $15 million in stock-based compensation expenses. R&D expense of $84 million, 19.4% of revenue, included $18 million in stock-based compensation expenses. Net income of\u00a0$57 million (13.3% net income margin, compared to 8.7% in Q4 2022), or\u00a0$0.75 per diluted share, supported non-GAAP net income of $85 million (19.8% margin), or $1.12 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of $91 million reflected an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from 19.6% in Q4 2022 driven by operating leverage.\n\nBoth Non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA exclude stock-based compensation expenses and net gains or losses related to our strategic investment portfolio. Operating cash flow of $140 million in the quarter supported Free Cash Flow of $116 million and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $121 million. As of December 31, 2023, Axon had $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, and outstanding convertible notes in principal amount of $690 million, for a net cash position of $553 million, up $121 million sequentially.\n\nFinancial commentary by segment\n\nSoftware & Sensors THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED CHANGE 31 DEC 2023 30 SEP 2023 31 DEC 2022 QoQ YoY (in\u00a0thousands) Axon Cloud and Services revenue(1) $ 163,632 $ 147,963 $ 113,538 10.6 % 44.1 % Axon Cloud gross margin 74.6 % 72.4 % 75.5 % 220 bp (90) bp Sensors and Other revenue $ 107,167 $ 103,068 $ 85,867 4.0 % 24.8 % Sensors and Other gross margin 46.3 % 45.2 % 41.5 % 110 bp 480 bp\n\n(1) The\u00a0TASER segment includes Cloud and Services revenue, which is not broken out here.\n\nAxon Cloud and Services revenue growth of 44.1% year over year reflects user growth, increasing adoption of premium add-on features related to Axon Evidence, real-time operations and productivity software, a growing base of software licenses associated with Axon Fleet systems and associated growth in professional services installations. Axon Cloud and Services gross margin of 74.6% decreased modestly year over year due to higher professional services costs related to Axon Fleet Systems installations. Our software-only gross margin continues to exceed our software gross margin target of 80%. Sensors and Other revenue growth of 24.8% year over year was driven by growth in Axon body cameras and accessories, primarily due to strength in demand for Axon Body 4. Sensors and Other gross margin of 46.3% increased year over year due to scale efficiencies on fixed costs and mix towards premium products, including Axon Body 4.\n\nTASER THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED CHANGE 31 DEC 2023 30 SEP 2023 31 DEC 2022 QoQ YoY (in\u00a0thousands) Revenue $ 161,343 $ 162,570 $ 136,737 (0.8) % 18.0 % Gross margin 57.1 % 62.5 % 61.6 % (540) bp (450) bp\n\nTASER segment revenue growth of 18% year over year was driven by the continued ramp of TASER 10, partially offset by a decline in TASER 7, which remained flat quarter over quarter. TASER segment gross margin of 57.1% decreased from 61.6% year over year primarily due to a 420 basis point headwind from warranty reserve charges recognized in the quarter related to a TASER 7 production issue that occurred largely in March 2023. Without this charge, TASER gross margins would have been down modestly due to mix. As a reminder, we are still ramping to scale volumes on TASER 10 and expect to make substantial progress in 2024, including moving to more automated production in the second half of the year.\n\nForward-looking performance indicators 31 DEC 2023 30 SEP 2023 30 JUN 2023 31 MAR 2023 31 DEC\u00a02022 ($ in\u00a0millions) Annual recurring revenue (1) $ 697 $ 619 $ 559 $ 520 $ 473 Net revenue retention (1) 122 % 122 % 122 % 121 % 121 % Total company future contracted revenue (1) $ 7,140 $ 5,819 $ 5,227 $ 4,778 $ 4,647\n\n(1) Refer to \"Statistical Definitions\" below.\n\nAnnual recurring revenue grew 47% year over year to $697 million, driven by Axon Cloud software growth, which reflects growing demand for our high-value software bundles and a growing base of connected devices in our ecosystem. Net revenue retention was 122% in the quarter, reflecting our ability to deliver additional value to our customers over time and de minimis\u00a0attrition. We drive adoption of our cloud software solutions through subscription plans, which include a variety of premium software options. This Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") metric excludes the hardware portion of customer subscriptions and is normalized to account for phased customer deployments throughout the year. Total company future contracted revenue grew to $7.1 billion. We expect to recognize between 15% to 25% of this balance over the next 12 months, and generally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following ten years.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Axon's expectations as of February 27, 2024, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to \"Forward-looking statements\" below for more information.\n\nAxon expects full year\u00a02024 revenue of $1.88 billion to $1.94 billion, representing approximately 20% to 24% annual growth. Axon expects a full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA dollars of $410 million to $430 million, implying continued Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from 2023.\n\nWe provide Adjusted EBITDA guidance, rather than net income guidance, due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting certain types of expenses and gains such as stock-based compensation, income tax expenses and gains or losses on marketable securities and\u00a0strategic investments, which affect net income but not Adjusted EBITDA. We are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of such expenses, which could be material, on net income. Accordingly, we do not provide a reconciliation of projected net income to projected Adjusted EBITDA. We expect stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately $205 million to $220 million for the full year.\n\nFull year expected stock based compensation expense includes approximately $42 million in expenses related to an enhanced equity compensation opportunity provided to employees whose compensation is under a specified threshold. We expect this expense to be primarily reflected within cost of goods sold with approximately half of the full year expense to be recognized in the first quarter, in line with vesting schedules which will occur over the next four years. Because our stock-based compensation expenses may vary based on changes in our stock price or\u00a0the actual timing of attainment of certain metrics, it is inherently difficult to forecast future stock-based compensation expense, which may also be materially affected by any future stock-based compensation plans, subject to shareholder approval. We expect 2024 CapEx to be in the range of $60 million to $75 million. Our 2024 CapEx plans include investments in TASER 10 automation and capacity expansion, including cartridge capacity and lab enhancements and global facility build-out and upgrades, including warehousing support for global shipping facilities.\n\nLong-Term Outlook\n\nLooking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to scale globally, to penetrate new customer verticals and to introduce new products that drive highly profitable revenue growth as we progress on our mission to protect life. We believe our\u00a0future opportunities will enable us to drive solid top and bottom-line growth, generate significant cash flow, and create meaningful value for our shareholders.\n\nLast year at this time, we provided a three-year target model for 2025, including a revenue target of $2 billion, implying a 20% revenue compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\"), and a 25% Adjusted EBITDA margin target. Given our strong revenue performance in 2023 and new 2024 guidance, which we are proud to provide above our outlook from this time last year, along with our progress on margin expansion, we are updating our long-term framework.\n\nBeyond 2024, we expect to achieve continued 20% or greater compound annual revenue growth and continue to target Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately\u00a025% as we continue to balance investing for growth and delivering strong profitability. We also remain committed to delivering strong cash generation with Adjusted Free Cash Flow conversion on Adjusted EBITDA of at least 60% by 2025. In addition, we remain focused on reducing annual dilution related to stock-based compensation and we continue to target average annual dilution from stock compensation expense of approximately 3% for 2025 and beyond.\n\nThank you for investing with us in this mission.\r\n-The Axon team\n\nQuarterly conference call and webcast We will host our Q4 2023 earnings conference call webinar on Tuesday, February 27, at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET.\n\nThe webcast will be available via a link on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com, or can be accessed directly via https://axon.zoom.us/j/94299685390.\n\nStatistical Definitions\n\nAnnual recurring revenue: Annual recurring revenue is a performance indicator that management believes provides more visibility into the growth of our revenue generated by our highest margin, recurring services. Annual recurring revenue should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue because it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace GAAP revenue or deferred revenue, as they can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. Annual recurring revenue is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue or deferred revenue. We calculate annual recurring revenue as monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue, annualized.\n\nNet revenue retention: Dollar-based net revenue retention is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and expand our relationships with existing customers. We calculate it as the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from a base set of agency customers from which we generated Axon Cloud subscription revenue in the last month of a quarter divided by the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from the year-ago month of that same customer base. This calculation includes high-margin warranty revenue\u00a0but purposely excludes the lower-margin hardware subscription component\u00a0of the customer contracts, as it is meant to be a SaaS metric that we use to monitor the health of the recurring revenue business we are building. This calculation also excludes the implied monthly revenue contribution of customers that were added since the year-ago quarter, and therefore excludes the benefit of new customer acquisition. The metric includes customers, if any, that terminated during the annual period, and therefore, this metric is inclusive of customer churn. This metric is downwardly adjusted to account for the effect of phased deployments\u2014meaning that, for the year-ago period, we consider the total contractually obligated implied monthly revenue amount, rather than monthly revenue amounts that might have been in actuality smaller on a GAAP basis due to the customer not having yet fully deployed their Axon solution. For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\n\nTotal company future contracted revenue: Total company future contracted revenue represents remaining performance obligation and includes both recognized contract liabilities as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods. The remaining performance obligations are limited only to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 as of December 31, 2023. We currently expect to recognize between 15% to 25% of this balance over the next 12 months, and generally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following ten years, subject to risks related to delayed deployments, budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\n\nTo supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented below.\n\nEBITDA (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Net income) - Earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Net income) -\u00a0Earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments to strategic investments and marketable securities, transaction costs related to acquisitions and investments, and other unusual, non-recurring pre-tax items that are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance (identified and listed below in the reconciliation). Adjusted EBITDA margin (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Net income margin) \u2013 Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Non-GAAP Net Income (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Net income) - Net income excluding the costs of non-cash stock-based compensation, gain/loss/write-down/disposal/abandonment of property, equipment and intangible assets; fair value adjustments to strategic investments and marketable securities; transaction costs related to acquisitions and investments; costs related to the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") litigation and antitrust litigation and\u00a0other unusual, non-recurring pre-tax items that are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance (listed below). The Company tax-effects non-GAAP adjustments using the blended statutory federal and state tax rates for each period presented. Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings Per share) - Measure of Company's Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding during the period presented. Free Cash Flow (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Cash flow from operating activities) - Cash flows provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most comparable GAAP Measure: Cash flow from operating activities) - Cash flows provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding the net impact of investments in our new Scottsdale, Arizona campus and bond premium amortization.\n\nWe believe that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow excluding the impact of bond premium amortization and net campus investment are non-GAAP measures that are useful to investors and management to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash. These non-GAAP measures can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity.\n\nCaution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures\n\nAlthough these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:\n\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to the Company's GAAP financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be superior to the Company's GAAP financial measures; and these non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance with GAAP or under a comprehensive set of rules or principles proposed by a third party. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies.\n\nAbout Axon Axon is a technology leader in global public safety.

However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: our exposure to cancellations of government contracts due to appropriation clauses, exercise of a cancellation clause, or non-exercise of contractually optional periods; the ability of law enforcement agencies to obtain funding, including based on tax revenues; our ability to design, introduce and sell new products, services or features; our ability to defend against litigation and protect our intellectual property, and the resulting costs of this activity; our ability to win bids through the open bidding process for governmental agencies; our ability to manage our supply chain and avoid production delays, shortages and impacts to expected gross margins; the impacts of inflation, macroeconomic conditions and global events; the impact of catastrophic events or public health emergencies; the impact of stock-based compensation expense, impairment expense, and income tax expense on our financial results; customer purchase behavior, including adoption of our software as a service delivery model; negative media publicity or sentiment regarding our products; the impact of various factors on projected gross margins; defects in, or misuse of, our products; changes in the costs of product components and labor; loss of customer data, a breach of security, or an extended outage, including by our third party cloud-based storage providers; exposure to international operational risks; delayed cash collections and possible credit losses due to our subscription model; changes in government regulations in the United States and in foreign markets, especially related to the classification of our products by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; our ability to integrate acquired businesses; the impact of declines in the fair values or impairment of our investments, including our strategic investments; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; litigation or inquiries and related time and costs; and counter-party risks relating to cash balances held in excess of federally insured limits. Many events beyond our control may determine whether results we anticipate will be achieved. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. The Annual Report on Form 10 K that we expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on February 27, 2024 lists various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. These factors are intended as cautionary statements for investors within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Readers can find them under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Reports, and investors should refer to them. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.\n\nExcept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 8-K, 10\u2011Q and 10\u2011K reports to the SEC. Our filings with the SEC may be accessed at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.\n\nUpdate on Legal Matters:\n\nNew Jersey Proposed Antitrust Class Action\n\nPending in the District of New Jersey (No. 3:23-cv-7182-RK-RLS) is a consolidated proposed class action lawsuit brought by the Township of Howell (NJ), the City of Augusta (ME), and the City of Baltimore (MD) alleging Axon's 2018 acquisition of Vievu LLC from Safariland LLC was anticompetitive, and that certain non-compete provisions in an ancillary holster supply agreement between Axon and Safariland LLC unlawfully retrained trade. The complaint is based primarily on claims by the FTC\u00a0 regarding the transaction, that were dismissed without condition or consent decree in October 2023. Axon denies the allegations and will vigorously defend the action.\n\nAs previously reported, at the time of the acquisition, Vievu LLC was a significantly financially distressed company destined to exit the market, and we believe Axon's action prevented major body-camera program disruptions for Vievu LLC customers. Plaintiffs Howell and Augusta have never purchased body-worn camera systems from Axon. Further, we believe Safariland LLC was never a TASER energy weapon competitor, had no intention of entering the energy weapon business, and has not done so in the four years since the parties rescinded the non-compete provisions of the holster agreement\u2014provisions intended to protect Axon's proprietary information and substantial intellectual property investments during new TASER product development.\n\nOn February 5, 2024, Axon served its motions to dismiss all claims and to strike the class allegations on numerous grounds, including that Axon's federal, state, and municipal customers with sovereign immunity cannot be absent class members. Plaintiffs' response is not due until mid-April with Axon's reply due in mid-May.\u00a0 A decision is therefore unlikely before year end.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nInvestor Relations\r\nAxon Enterprise,\u00a0Inc.\r\nIR@axon.com\n\nAXON ENTERPRISE,\u00a0INC.\n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(in thousands, except per share data) THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED TWELVE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED 31 DEC 2023 30 SEP 2023 31 DEC 2022 31 DEC 2023 31 DEC 2022 Net sales from products $ 258,405 $ 256,443 $ 214,735 $ 967,711 $ 801,388 Net sales from services 173,737 157,158 121,407 595,680 388,547 Net sales 432,142 413,601 336,142 1,563,391 1,189,935 Cost of product sales 125,664 116,278 102,641 450,718 363,219 Cost of service sales 42,591 42,051 27,822 157,291 98,078 Cost of sales 168,255 158,329 130,463 608,009 461,297 Gross margin 263,887 255,272 205,679 955,382 728,638 Operating expenses: Sales, general and administrative 137,106 123,279 114,418 496,874 401,575 Research and development 83,972 76,880 68,720 303,719 233,810 Total operating expenses 221,078 200,159 183,138 800,593 635,385 Income from operations 42,809 55,113 22,541 154,789 93,253 Interest Income, net 12,325 10,458 4,140 42,112 4,294 Other income (loss), net 668 3,852 8,049 (41,901) 98,971 Income before provision for income taxes 55,802 69,423 34,730 155,000 196,518 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes (1,469) 10,026 5,555 (19,227) 49,379 Net income $ 57,271 $ 59,397 $ 29,175 $ 174,227 $ 147,139 Net income per common and common equivalent shares: Basic $ 0.76 $ 0.79 $ 0.41 $ 2.35 $ 2.07 Diluted $ 0.75 $ 0.78 $ 0.40 $ 2.31 $ 2.03 Weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding: Basic 75,060 74,826 71,270 74,195 71,093 Diluted 76,178 75,952 72,976 75,456 72,534\n\nAXON ENTERPRISE,\u00a0INC.\n\nSEGMENT REPORTING\n\n(in thousands) THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED THREE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED 31 DEC 2023 30 SEP 2023 31 DEC 2022 Software Software Software and and and TASER Sensors Total TASER Sensors Total TASER Sensors Total Net sales from products (1) $ 151,238 $ 107,167 $ 258,405 $ 153,375 $ 103,068 $ 256,443 $ 128,868 $ 85,867 $ 214,735 Net sales from services (2) 10,105 163,632 173,737 9,195 147,963 157,158 7,869 113,538 121,407 Net sales 161,343 270,799 432,142 162,570 251,031 413,601 136,737 199,405 336,142 Cost of product sales 68,067 57,597 125,664 59,746 56,532 116,278 52,447 50,194 102,641 Cost of service sales 1,096 41,495 42,591 1,252 40,799 42,051 \u2014 27,822 27,822 Cost of sales 69,163 99,092 168,255 60,998 97,331 158,329 52,447 78,016 130,463 Gross margin 92,180 171,707 263,887 101,572 153,700 255,272 84,290 121,389 205,679 Gross margin % 57.1 % 63.4 % 61.1 % 62.5 % 61.2 % 61.7 % 61.6 % 60.9 % 61.2 % Research and development 16,265 67,707 83,972 15,672 61,208 76,880 14,531 54,189 68,720\n\nTWELVE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED TWELVE\u00a0MONTHS\u00a0ENDED 31 DEC 2023 31 DEC 2022 Software Software and and TASER Sensors Total TASER Sensors Total Net sales from products (1) $ 577,610 $ 390,101 $ 967,711 $ 511,010 $ 290,378 $ 801,388 Net sales from services (2) 34,995 560,685 595,680 20,556 367,991 388,547 Net sales 612,605 950,786 1,563,391 531,566 658,369 1,189,935 Cost of product sales 238,364 212,354 450,718 194,957 168,262 363,219 Cost of service sales 3,613 153,678 157,291 \u2014 98,078 98,078 Cost of sales 241,977 366,032 608,009 194,957 266,340 461,297 Gross margin 370,628 584,754 955,382 336,609 392,029 728,638 Gross margin % 60.5 % 61.5 % 61.1 % 63.3 % 59.5 % 61.2 % Research and development 62,393 241,326 303,719 51,607 182,203 233,810\n\n(1)  Software and Sensors \"products\" revenue consists of sensors, including on-officer body cameras, Axon Fleet cameras, other hardware sensors, warranties on sensors, and other products, and is sometimes referred to as Sensors and Other revenue.

        "title": "AXON Gears Up to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?",
        "content": "Axon Enterprise, Inc. AXON is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 27, after market close.\r\n\r\nThe company has a stellar earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 61.1%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for the company\u2019s fourth-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $419 million, suggesting an increase of 24.7% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. The consensus estimate for the company\u2019s adjusted earnings is pinned at 48 cents per share, indicating a 33.3% increase from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for Axon this earnings season.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nAxon\u2019s TASER segment\u2019s fourth-quarter 2023 performance is expected to have gained from strong demand for TASER devices and higher cartridge revenues. Also, segmental performance is likely to have reflected strong sales from virtual reality training services. However, reduced demand for Axon\u2019s legacy TASER 7-series has been partly affecting the performance of the TASER segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the TASER segment\u2019s gross margin in the fourth quarter is pegged at $103 million, increasing 1% sequentially.\r\n\r\nThe Software & Sensors segment is expected to have generated higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter supported by the addition of new users and associated devices to the AXON network. Strong momentum in Axon Evidence and cloud services, driven by an increase in the aggregate number of users, average revenue per user and software add-ons are also likely to have driven segmental revenues.\r\n\r\nThe company has been witnessing strong customer response for its newly launched next-generation body-worn camera, Axon Body 4, which is also expected to have driven the segment\u2019s performance. The consensus mark for Software & Sensors net sales is pegged at $258 million, increasing 2.8% sequentially. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment\u2019s gross margin in the fourth quarter is pegged at $157 million, increasing 2% sequentially.\r\n\r\nHowever, the escalating cost of sales due to raw material cost inflation is likely to have weighed on AXON\u2019s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company has been investing heavily in product innovation for some time now. For instance, in the first nine months of 2023, the company incurred research and development expenses of $219.7 million, up 33.1% year over year. Hefty investments in research and development are likely to have adversely affected the company\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s international presence keeps it exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations, which are likely have hurt its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAxon Enterprise, Inc Price and Consensus\n\nAxon Enterprise, Inc price-consensus-chart | Axon Enterprise, Inc Quote\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AXON this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Axon has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 86 cents. You can uncover the best stocks before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: Axon presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nHighlights of Q3 Earnings\n\nAxon reported third-quarter 2023 earnings of $1.02 per share. The bottom line increased significantly year over year despite a 33.6% jump in the cost of sales. Total revenues of $413.6 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $393.8 million and augmented 32.7% year over year. The top line benefited from strength in Axon Cloud software, demand for Axon Fleet systems and the ramp-up of TASER 10 and Axon Body 4.\n\nPerformance of Other Industrial Companies\n\nA. O. Smith Corporation\u2019s AOS fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents. The bottom line jumped 13% year over year. Net sales of $988.1 million narrowly missed the consensus estimate of $989 million. However, the top line increased 5.6% year over year.\r\n\r\nIllinois Tool Works Inc. ITW reported fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.42 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.40. Earnings increased 3.4% year over year.\u00a0 The company\u2019s revenues of $3.98 billion missed the consensus estimate of $4.01 billion. The top line inched up 0.3% year over year.\n\nStock to Consider\n\nHere is a company within the broader Industrial Products sector, which according to our model, has the right combination of elements to beat on earnings.\n\nSealed Air Corporation SEE has an Earnings ESP of +3.46% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe company is slated to release fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 27. Sealed Air\u2019s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in one, the average beat being 9.3%.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In the latest market close, Axon Enterprise (AXON) reached $267.70, with a -0.78% movement compared to the previous day. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.6%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.17%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.92%.\n\nThe maker of stun guns and body cameras's shares have seen an increase of 3.91% over the last month, not keeping up with the Industrial Products sector's gain of 5.78% and outstripping the S&P 500's gain of 3.56%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Axon Enterprise will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on February 27, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $0.86, marking a 22.86% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $418.97 million, showing a 24.64% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Axon Enterprise. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Axon Enterprise presently features a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nInvestors should also note Axon Enterprise's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 65.14. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 19.98.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Security and Safety Services industry is part of the Industrial Products sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 37, placing it within the top 15% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

        "title": "Trump Triumph: 7 Stocks to Buy if Republicans Win the Election in 2024",
        "content": "A few days ago, we discussed several stocks that could benefit from a Biden economic boom if he wins reelection in 2024. However, today I want to consider an alternative scenario \u2013 a triumph from former president Donald Trump. Given Trump\u2019s resurgence in recent polls, I believe this outcome may be more probable than many think.\n\nWhile the Biden administration has overseen a robust economic recovery from the pandemic, many middle- and working-class families continue to struggle with inflation and rising costs of living. Recent foreign policy challenges have also dragged down Biden\u2019s approval ratings, raising electability concerns given his age. With less than a year until the 2024 election, the race remains fluid. But if you think Trump could pull off a comeback victory, certain stocks are worth considering. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage. Focus on cellphone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) is a company developing technology and weapons products for military, law enforcement, and civilian use. Indeed, I think this is among the bestl-positioned companies to benefit from Trump\u2019s policies, should he triumph in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrump has repeatedly vowed to crack down on crime, secure the southern border, and support domestic police departments. He is also likely to increase military spending substantially. This all bodes very well with respect to demand growth for Axon\u2019s suite of body cameras, digital evidence management platforms, and non-lethal weapons.\n\nRecently, Axon made a savvy move to acquire Fusus, providing real-time operations software to grow the company\u2019s total addressable market by $20 billion. The new Axon Body Workforce product line also cleverly expands Axon\u2019s reach into commercial sectors like retail and healthcare. Under a second Trump term, I would expect significant tailwinds for both Axon\u2019s public sector and private sector business segments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is already executing tremendously well. Axon\u2019s Q3 sales grew 33% and its profitability is stellar. Thus, I believe AXON stock deserves the premium it trades at, given its prospective growth prospects.\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR) The Baker Hughes (BKR) sign and office building in Houston, Texas.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) is poised to benefit immensely from a Trump-led \u2018America First\u2019 agenda in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised to unleash America\u2019s \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d energy production potential. He is likely to reduce regulations substantially for domestic oil and gas producers, while expediting LNG export projects globally. This should translate into a surge of new business for Baker Hughes.\n\nWhile BKR stock has struggled amid concerns over a growth slowdown, a second Trump term could profoundly change the company\u2019s trajectory. In the company\u2019s core Oil Field Services and Equipment segment, Baker Hughes still managed to grow 2023 revenues by 16%, while growing its operating margins by an impressive 80 basis points.\n\nThus, Baker Hughes\u2019 outlook remains cautiously optimistic. Under a Trump administration (likely unwilling to beg OPEC for more oil abroad but rather maximize our domestic production), Baker Hughes is sure to see accelerating order growth both onshore and offshore. Its LNG capabilities will also be in high demand. Trading at a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 14-times, Baker Hughes seems like a value stock ready to erupt. If Trump brings a driller\u2019s mentality back to the White House, few companies offer more upside than Baker Hughes right now.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) A sign for JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM).\n\nSource: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the largest and most influential global banks, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) should perform well no matter who occupies the Oval Office. But a Trump triumph in 2024 could provide particularly positive catalysts for the mega bank.\n\nWhile Trump has a small personal stake in JPMorgan, this is unlikely to impact policy decisions much. Far more important is his preference for bilateral trade deals, reduced regulations, and historically low interest rates to stimulate growth. Lower interest rates actually tend to reduce bank profitability by compressing net interest margin, but can improve the debt service capacity of its customers, so it\u2019s a double-edged sword.\n\nHowever, I expect a surge in lending activity under Trump\u2019s economic vision. This revenue growth could more than offset any margin deterioration for well-run banks like JPMorgan. Trump is also likely to be less-inclined to impose restrictive regulations on banks than his predecessors. And if an unlikely systemic crisis did threaten major banks, Trump has signaled a willingness to have the Federal Reserve intervene aggressively, as it did back in 2020.\n\nWith its diversified business mix spanning commercial and investment banking, asset management, and other segments, JPMorgan remains an indispensable pillar of the global financial system. While Trump\u2019s views on interest rates concern some bank investors, I believe easing regulations and deal-making will outweigh pressures on net interest margins.\n\nJPMorgan survived the Great Recession intact and entered the current robust economy in a position of strength. Betting against this financial powerhouse seems unwise, regardless of 2024\u2019s electoral outcome.\n\nRumble (RUM) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Rumble logo displayed on the screen. RUM stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA right-leaning video platform competing with the likes of YouTube, Rumble (NASDAQ:RUM) has seen tremendous growth since Trump joined the platform after post-bans from other mainstream social media sites. The company\u2019s stock price reflects enthusiasm around another Trump presidential term, surging 75% year-to-date.\n\nIf Trump wins again, Rumble should continue benefiting from expanded brand awareness and user growth as it becomes the go-to video site for conservative voices. Trump would also likely pursue policies aimed at limiting the power of other big tech companies, creating an opening for Rumble to gain market share. While profitability remains elusive for now, Rumble\u2019s revenue growth rate has remained at triple-digit levels, as user engagement booms.\n\nWith $267 million in cash and almost no debt, Rumble has years of runway to grow into its valuation. I\u2019ll admit the company\u2019s current valuation gives me a little vertigo. But in a scenario where Trump returns and his supporters flock to Rumble en masse heading into the 2024 election, speculative upside still exists here. This could become the platform of choice for an entire political movement.\n\nBorr Drilling (BORR) Rise in gasoline prices concept with double exposure of digital screen with financial chart graphs and oil pumps on a field. Oil prices and oil price predictions\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs an offshore driller operating specialized modern jack-up rigs, Borr Drilling (NYSE:BORR) would find smooth sailing under a second Trump term. With Trump promising to unleash domestic oil production, roll back regulations, and rehabilitate the wider fossil fuel industry, offshore drilling companies like Borr should have ample growth opportunities.\n\nThe company\u2019s utilization rates already stand at 94% with full order books, as offshore drilling capacity remains scarce. Additionally, Borr has locked in future contracts at highly-favorable day rates as well, with upward rate momentum seeming likely to persist. Even if rates plateau, Borr is set to generate over $500 million of 2024 EBITDA, allowing for rapid de-leveraging and a continuation of capital return to shareholders. Notably, Borr also secured $82 million for three additional jack-up rigs, signaling more growth could be on the horizon.\n\nThat said, BORR stock trades at just 8-times 2024 estimated earnings, while analysts forecast ~30% revenue growth ahead. That\u2019s too cheap for a quality name like this.\n\nSeadrill (SDRL) Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buy\n\nSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother premier offshore driller, Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL) seems certain to prosper under a Trump administration bullish on resurrecting domestic oil production in unapologetic fashion.\n\nImportantly, Seadrill just won $1.1 billion in new contracts from a Brazilian giant. It\u2019s certainly not a leap to suggest that a president promising to greenlight drilling permitting could bring a gusher of new business domestically, too.\n\nWith the company\u2019s earnings per share expected to recover from its decline in the years ahead, a Trump win provides added catalysts for Seadrill. The offshore industry desperately needs drilling capacity, and Seadrill now has a clean balance sheet (and substantial share buybacks) to entice investors to continue to put capital to work in this name.\n\nTrading at bargain multiples relative to its potential earnings power, SDRL stock should regain its former glory if Trump throws his full weight behind offshore production. For shareholders willing to stomach commodity volatility, I believe Seadrill offers elite risk/reward here.\n\nFord Motor (F) 2022 Ford (F stock) F-150 Lightning Lariat\n\nSource: Ford\n\nAs an iconic American automaker, Ford (NYSE:F) seems poised for a comeback under a Trump presidency. Trump\u2019s policies are likely to be much less hostile to internal combustion engine makers, focused more on improving the range of consumer choices on the market.\n\nRather than subsidizing EVs at the expense of traditional autos, Trump would likely let the market determine winning technologies. This levels the playing field for Ford to better compete with pure-play EV makers.\n\nFord\u2019s core operations are strengthening too \u2013 its remarkable recovery since January suggests the UAW scandal is fading while momentum builds. With long-term earnings per share growth expected, Ford\u2019s stock price appears to be severely undervalued at current levels.\n\nFord\u2019s management team is already reassessing its aggressive EV push to avoid overextending the company\u2019s balance sheet. I think this is a prudent move, and could be a timely one, if Trump wins the White House again. While EVs and hybrids remain critical to Ford\u2019s future, Trump\u2019s friendlier stance toward gas-powered vehicles should ease pressure on the company to abandon their EV ambitions entirely. That\u2019s good for the company, and for the environment as well (one could argue).\n\nTrading at just 7-times 2024 earnings with positive catalysts mounting, Ford seems ready to rev up and regain glory. Its proud legacy deserves preservation, and President Trump\u2019s industry-agnostic policy preference could fuel a Ford comeback.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Axon Enterprise, Inc (AXON) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Axon Enterprise (AXON) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this maker of stun guns and body cameras have returned +8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Security and Safety Services industry, to which Axon belongs, has gained 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Axon is expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share, indicating a change of +22.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.86 points to a change of +76.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.14 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Axon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Axon is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Axon, the consensus sales estimate of $418.97 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +24.6%. The $1.55 billion and $1.87 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +30.3% and +20.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAxon reported revenues of $413.6 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.7%. EPS of $1.02 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $393.77 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.04%. The EPS surprise was +34.21%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAxon is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Axon. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXON).

        "title": "13 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best aerospace and defense stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the high technology aerospace and defense industry and how it's shaped the modern day world, you can take a look at the 5 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the defense and aerospace industry is one of the most important in the world when it comes to shaping power politics. Global geopolitics, and as the late Henry Kissinger would describe, 'realpolitik' is based on the cold, hard reality of military superiority. Traditionally, this superiority came in the form of strength in numbers - a concept that still holds true today.\n\nHowever, along with this, another concept that has borne the test of time is the use of technology for warfare. Whether it's the Mongols who relied on brutal cavalry tactics, or the Ottoman use of gunpowder that made it a 'gunpowder empire', technology has shaped warfare and global power dynamics.\n\nThese days, the dominant and only superpower (some would even say a hyperpower) is the United States of America. The U.S., if you're unaware, has the most powerful military in the world, fueled by the greatest number of aircraft carriers for any military and an air force whose aircraft number in the thousands. Safe to say, aerospace plays a crucial role in maintaining American global military superiority, and by effect, it also shapes the global world order.\n\nPowering the U.S. military behemoth, which also has the biggest defense budget in the world, are aerospace and defense stocks. These stocks are firms that either directly engage in providing the U.S. military, through the Department of Defense, with their combat or combat support equipment, or those that provide essential and tertiary capabilities such as the defense stock Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Maxar Technologies whose advanced satellites carry the ability to remotely image any site in the world and provide military planners with invaluable information to inform their tactical and strategic decisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nTechnology sits at the heart of competing when it comes to defense and aerospace stocks, and a technological edge is precisely the reason that the U.S. is at the top of the global power food chain. American jets are envied by dictators and monarchs all over the world, and no matter what their public statements against the U.S. are, it wouldn't be imprudent to assume that they would give an arm and a leg (and then some) to get a taste of what American defense and aerospace stocks have to offer.\n\nSo what exactly do they offer? Well, let's start with one of the most well known defense and aerospace stocks in the world, the Bethesda, Maryland based aerospace firm Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed, if you're unaware, makes and sells fighter aircraft. While it also has other divisions, such as a space segment that aims to develop a colony on the Moon complete with a nuclear reactor in partnership with the National Aerospace and Space Administration (NASA), Lockheed Martin's bread and butter are airplanes. The firm in its current form came into being in the late 1990s as the U.S. defense industry consolidated (more on that later). Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, after it acquired General Dynamics - perhaps one of the most consequential defense and aerospace stocks in the world.\n\nThat's a tall claim. So what made Martin Marietta so special? Well, the firm bought General Dynamics in 1993 -\u00a0 a deal that also saw it acquire the rights to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F-16 is the most successful fighter aircraft in the world and is used by most of the world's leading air forces. Its success has defined modern day dog fighting - an art that bulky fighter jets such as the The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s F-15 struggled with.\n\nLockheed has moved past dog fighting since then. For aerospace and defense stocks, the 21st century has been all about stealth. Lockheed's F-117 'Nighthawk' and the technologies used on it dominated the stealth debate for decades, and led to the development of the world's only operational fifth generation fighter aircraft, the F-22 'Raptor'. America's crown jewel, the Raptor is an air superiority fighter designed with the singular aim of ensuring that enemy fighters cannot contest the United States Air Force's control of an airspace.\n\nSo, as aerospace and defense stocks continue to make magic a reality, we decided to take a look at some top stocks. Among these, the notable ones are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX). 13 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In\n\nAndrey Khachatryan/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best aerospace and defense stocks, we ranked the 40 most valuable aerospace and defense stocks that trade in U.S. markets by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q3 2023.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy to Outperform \u2018The Magnificent Seven\u2019",
        "content": "You\u2019ve likely heard a lot about the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks lately. These companies included in this group are: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This group of Big Tech elite companies have been trouncing the broader market over the past year with their strong returns.\n\nBut there are still great opportunities to find stocks that can outperform these heavyweights. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the Magnificent Seven should form the core of most growth stock portfolios. However, by digging deeper, smaller yet rapidly-growing companies in high-potential sectors could supercharge your investment returns.\n\nMy aim isn\u2019t to uncover \u201cthe next Amazon\u201d or predict which small caps will reach trillion-dollar valuations. Instead, I look for quality businesses with vast addressable markets, durable competitive advantages, and the ability to compound earnings substantially over long periods. The seven stocks revealed here check all those boxes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFTAI Aviation (FTAI) An image of a futuristic aerospace engine rendering\n\nSource: solarseven / Shutterstock\n\nFTAI Aviation\u2019s (NASDAQ:FTAI) performance has been nothing short of remarkable lately. This high-flyer has skyrocketed 143% over the past 12 months, with momentum only accelerating as of late. Just take a look at the company\u2019s five-year return \u2013 up a whopping 348%!\n\nNow, stocks posting triple-digit gains tend to make me cautious, wondering whether their share price is getting detached from financial realities. However, one glance at FTAI Aviation\u2019s financial statements shows this is no house of cards.\n\nFTAI owns and manages commercial aircraft engines, focusing on the widely-used CFM56 models. The company also invests in other aviation assets and aerospace products, churning out strong cash flows with room for earnings growth. Revenue in Q3 2023 hit $291.1 million, a 26.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, net income landed at $41.3 million, representing fat profit margins of 14.2%. To put it bluntly, this is a much more profitable enterprise than 85% of its business services peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven better, the good times look set to continue. Consensus estimates call for 50% annual earnings per share growth over the next two years, with the stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times 2024 estimates. It\u2019s not exactly cheap, but you\u2019re paying up for quality. And at 4.5-times expected 2024 revenue, I don\u2019t think the company\u2019s valuation is outrageous by any means.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) AI stocks an intelligent robot figure representing ai stocks, investing for the next decade. Artificial Intelligence Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been an absolute superstar, too. Shares have gone vertical over the past few weeks, riding the mounting hype around artificial intelligence. There\u2019s no denying Super Micro has made all the right moves to capitalize on this mega trend. However, with the company\u2019s stock price detached from its fundamentals, we could see significant downside if AI mania cools off.\n\nLet\u2019s take a sober look at the numbers. SMCI stock currently changes hands at roughly 30-times forward earnings and 2.2-times expected FY2024 sales. That\u2019s pretty rich for a company projected to grow revenue at a 20% annual clip moving forward. Still, profits should expand even faster, given what was reported in Super Micro\u2019s blowout Q4 report. The company trounced earnings per share estimates by 8.3% and beat the revenue consensus by 12.5%. Indeed, those are strong results by any measure. Plus, it should be noted that semiconductor companies trade at much steeper premiums. This valuation isn\u2019t out of the ordinary in its industry.\n\nIf AI hype continues gaining momentum, SMCI stock has ample room to grow into its lofty valuation. But with this stock seemingly priced to perfection, one slight disappointment could spell trouble. Consider me cautiously optimistic here. I like what Super Micro is building.\n\nSurgePays (SURG) undervalued fintech stocks A concept image of a hand reaching toward the word \"Fintech,\" which is surrounded by icons representing money and growth. Fintech Stock Bargains, fintech stock\n\nSource: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor an under-the-radar pick, allow me to highlight SurgePays (NASDAQ:SURG). This tiny company has somehow flown completely beneath Wall Street\u2019s radar, meaning hardly any analysts provide coverage on the company. But once you peek under the hood, I think you\u2019ll agree that SurgePays has intriguing potential.\n\nSurgePays offers a suite of financial and telecom products catering to underbanked and underserved groups across the United States. The company\u2019s core product is a fintech platform empowering retail clerks to handle transactions like prepaid wireless plans, gift cards, and debit services at the point of sale. It\u2019s a win-win arrangement \u2013 partner stores profit on each transaction while providing valuable services to customers. SurgePays also utilizes federal subsidies to supply tablet devices and cellular broadband to income-eligible households.\n\nRight now, SurgePays sports a market cap equal to annual revenue. Shares trade at just 4.7-times forward earnings, despite just $5.5 million of debt against $12.7 million of cash in the coffers. This year, SurgePays acquired ClearLine Mobile in a $15 million deal funded by a recent equity offering. Growth is the name of the game, and I applaud the recent move to scoop up a fast-growing target while SURG stock itself remains attractively-priced.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) has been an absolute star player in the broader semiconductor space. As a leading electronic design automation (EDA) outfit, Synopsys provides mission-critical tools and services that chipmakers rely on to design and manufacture advanced semiconductors. With the industry running on all cylinders, it\u2019s no surprise SNPS stock has lit up the scoreboard.\n\nIn Q3, Synopsys grew revenue to over $1.6 billion, a 24.5% year-over-year surge. Meanwhile, its net margins approached 22%, powering 83% profit growth over the same period last year. This level of expansion is tremendously impressive. Due to this tremendous performance, SNPS shares have tacked on 55% over the past 52 weeks.\n\nAs a long-term partner enabling Nvidia\u2019s innovations, Synopsys has also benefited handsomely from the GPU giant\u2019s success. The bottom line is that Synopsys is significantly more profitable than 95% of industry peers. At 42-times forward earnings, the valuation gives me minimal pause, considering the quality of this business. So long as AI and next-gen chips drive multi-year growth runways, I expect SNPS stock to continue compounding at an enviable clip.\n\nTransDigm Group (TDG) a jet takes off on a clear runway.\n\nSource: m.photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nTransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG) is a leading designer and producer of highly-engineered aircraft components and systems. Through its 48 subsidiaries, TransDigm boasts an impressive portfolio serving both commercial and military aircraft manufacturers.\n\nI love seeing the profit engine firing on all cylinders here. TransDigm reported a 22.4% net margin last quarter, handily besting more than 90% of aerospace and defense peers. Zooming out further, the company\u2019s three-year annualized earnings per share growth rate comes in at nearly 40% (excluding non-recurring items). And if we just look at the past year, earnings per share growth excluding these items came in hot at a blistering 63.5%.\n\nRevenue rose 21% in 2023, supported by 27% growth in the high-margin aftermarket commercial segment. TransDigm continues to benefit from the ongoing recovery in global air travel. Shares trade at 35-times forward earnings, which I\u2019m perfectly comfortable paying for durable earnings growth in the high single-digits. Additionally, the company\u2019s 4Q report was superb, with TransDigm beating estimates across the board on revenue, EBITDA, and EPS. Plus, management announced a special $2 billion dividend on top of upbeat 2024 guidance. Sign me up!\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) A drone being used by soldiers.\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) is undoubtedly pricy by traditional valuation standards. Shares trade hands at 67-times forward earnings and 12.4-times expected 2023 sales. But I believe the TASER maker\u2019s entrenched position supplying non-lethal weapons to global law enforcement agencies warrants a premium.\n\nExpected to deliver 30%+ revenue growth this year alongside 76% bottom line expansion, Axon is firing on all cylinders. The company continues rolling out innovative technologies like body cameras, records management software, drone solutions, and training to become the premier public safety tech provider.\n\nWith elections nearing, we could see rising tensions on the streets. Axon would likely benefit from a tough-on-crime stance from future administrations. The recent Fusus acquisition and new body camera line for commercial markets should also boost the company\u2019s total addressable market (TAM) by more than $20 billion. So, while this stock\u2019s sticker price gives me a moment\u2019s pause, I remain firmly bullish on Axon\u2019s long-term outlook.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen I look at e-commerce and fintech growth exposure overseas, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) remains high on my buy list. Dubbed the \u201cAmazon of Latin America,\u201d MercadoLibre operates online marketplaces spanning 18 countries and serving more than 148 million users.\n\nDespite torrid growth, MercadoLibre\u2019s balance sheet has surprisingly little debt with a 0.6-times net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. This financial strength provides ample dry powder for continued growth. Consensus estimates call for 35% annualized earnings per share growth over the next decade, which would result in a profitability boost of 13x from 2023 to 2032.\n\nSo, while shares trade at a meaty 77-times forward earnings today, I believe that the multiple on MELI stock could actually prove conservative given MercadoLibre\u2019s vast runway. As Latin America\u2019s middle class expands, the adoption of e-commerce and digital payments should accelerate. With market leadership secured, MercadoLibre remains my top pick to capitalize on this multi-year tailwind.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Snowflake Just Got a \"License\" to Target an Entirely New Customer Base. Here's What Investors Should Know",
        "content": "What if you had a license to go after a multibillion-dollar market opportunity that was closed off to many of your biggest competitors? That's exactly what cloud-based data company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) believes it has.\n\nOn Dec. 11, Snowflake announced it had achieved FedRAMP High Authorization from The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). This government program provides a standardized approach to ensuring that cloud services are secure and low-risk for various agencies.\n\nIn an interview with Data Cloud Now, Snowflake Senior District Manager Enterprise Kevin Griffith said, \"Companies that have achieved this certification, they view it as a hunting license,\" to get new federal customers. He went on to say, \"The companies that don't have it, the perception is that the market is closed.\"\n\nWhat could this all mean for Snowflake investors?\n\nThe federal market opportunity\n\nSnowflake's announcement reminds me of a similar announcement from law enforcement technology company Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON). The company offers tasers and body cameras to officers. But it also has cloud-based software for managing data.\n\nIn December 2022, Axon announced that it had received the highest level of authorization from FedRAMP. And this has already made a difference in its business. For Axon, it believes serving federal customers is a $10 billion opportunity. And in the third quarter of 2023, five out of its top 10 deals were from federal customers. In fact, one of its new customers was the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nResults from Axon demonstrate that FedRAMP authorization can quickly catalyze growth with federal customers.\n\nIn its press release, Snowflake didn't disclose how big it believes its federal market opportunity to be. However, a report from Verified Market Research puts the cloud market for government agencies worldwide at over $80 billion by 2030. Other third-party reports point in the same general direction.\n\nStory continues\n\nCircling back to Griffith, he says that federal customers should represent around 10% of Snowflake's revenue. Looking ahead, the company is targeting $10 billion in product revenue by its fiscal 2029 (which mostly overlaps with calendar 2028). Therefore, federal customers could be a billion-dollar business for Snowflake over the long term.\n\nIs this the boost Snowflake stock needs?\n\nIt's impressive that Snowflake's management has already issued guidance for its fiscal 2029. However, many investors bought Snowflake stock on the basis of those far-out target numbers. That's risky because many unforeseen things can happen given that much time.\n\nSnowflake is expected to report finalized fiscal 2024 results next month. But guidance implies about $2.7 billion in full-year product revenue. To achieve its fiscal 2029 goal, therefore, it needs to grow at a slightly better-than 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).\n\nSnowflake has been a phenomenal growth stock since it went public in 2020. However, the chart below shows that its growth rate is plunging fast. And its guidance for the upcoming Q4 implies just 29% to 30% growth, which is already dipping below what it needs to hit its fiscal 2029 targets. SNOW Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nA lot of unforeseen bad things can happen given enough time. But that goes both ways. Unforeseen positive catalysts can also emerge. And perhaps that's what Snowflake's federal authorization will ultimately prove to be. By opening up a new customer demographic, it's possible its growth rate will pick back up and propel it to its fiscal 2029 targets.\n\nSnowflake investors will certainly hope that's true. Growth within its existing customer base shows further signs of a slowdown, so making it up with a new market opportunity is important. The company's existing customers do continue to increase their spending. But Snowflake's remaining performance obligations of $3.7 billion were only up by 23% in 2023's Q3.\n\nRemaining performance obligations represent spending contracts and are a good way to predict future revenue. Granted, customers can always spend beyond what's in their contracts, so this metric isn't conclusive. But the slowing growth in remaining performance obligations suggest a further deceleration in revenue growth.\n\nIn any case, Snowflake's shareholders will want to watch how growth with federal customers plays out in the coming year. Axon's results show that good things can happen quickly. And it would certainly be a welcome boost to its growth rate if the same happened with Snowflake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Snowflake wasn't one of them.
