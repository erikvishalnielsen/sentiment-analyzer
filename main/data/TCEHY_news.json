        "content": "The Beijing Central Axis is now ready for digital visitors from around the world\n\nSHENZHEN, China, July 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Tencent (0700.HK) today launched the largest virtual urban historical landscape created to date called Microcosm, an immersive experience that brings Beijing's Central Axis to life online. The project launch coincides with the addition of the Central Axis to the World Heritage List by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nMicrocosm, which can be accessed via the Digital Central Axis Weixin Mini Program (\u4e91\u4e0a\u4e2d\u8f74), offers users an immersive guided tour of the landmark that they can enjoy at their own pace. Guided by avatars, anyone with a smartphone can explore the 3D virtual replica of the heritage site in the Chinese capital in breathtaking detail. Users can explore the Digital Central Axis throughout its history, even areas and scenes that may have been damaged or are no longer visible in real life.\n\nThe Mini Program also provides a platform for the Digital Watchman project, an innovative crowdsourced conservation initiative launched in December 2023. By simply scanning QR codes, taking photos and uploading inspection reports through the Mini Program, locals and visitors can become citizen stewards, logging signs of deterioration or damage. Citizen conservation reports make it easier to maintain a large heritage site like the Central Axis.\n\n\"Through our digital capabilities and gametech, and with our partners, we are exploring a creative path to bring cultural heritage to life in the digital era. The Digital Central Axis Project exemplifies how digital innovation can be used not only to conserve, but also to revitalize these important cultural monuments,\" said Zhan Shu, Head of Digital Culture Lab, Tencent's Sustainable Social Value Organization.\n\nThe Axis is well known inside China but may be less familiar in other parts of the world. It stretches approximately 7.8 kilometers from north to south in the capital city, reflecting Chinese imperial design and urban planning that began in the 13th century. The site includes 15 heritage landmarks such as the Forbidden City, the Bell and Drum Towers, Jingshan Hill, and the Temple of Heaven. Its symmetry and layout reflect a traditional system of order and harmony between humans and nature that has prevailed from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties all the way through to the China of today.\n\nMicrocosm took three years to create, using high-definition scanning, modeling, PCG auto-generation, and other game technologies. A sophisticated five-level map mode covers 200km x 200km and includes 300,000 plants and 2.2 million buildings, as well as hills and water features. In all, the virtual space contains over 15 terabytes of 3D data and a total of 10.4 billion facets.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs part of the Digital Central Axis Project, Tencent has also woven the elements of the cultural wonders into many scenarios \u2014 including music, videos, animations and even mobile games \u2014 for conservation and research purposes. For example, millions of young people have found creative and innovative ways to take part in games licensed with the Beijing Central Axis intellectual property, which in turn has created favorable public sentiment for cultural preservation.\n\nTo date, the Digital Central Axis Weixin Mini Program has logged more than 4.5 million visits, 800,000 registered users, and 17,000 Digital Watchman volunteers contributing more than 70,000 inspection photos leading to proactive conservation.\n\nThe Digital Central Axis project shows the power of big data, cloud computing, gametech, AI, and knowledge maps in conservation and heritage projects. The technologies can create meaningful experiences, help engage the public, and protect more of the world's cultural treasures in the digital era.\n\nFor media inquiries, please contact us at gc@tencent.com\n\nAbout Tencent\n\nTencent is a world-leading internet and technology company that develops innovative products and services to improve the quality of life of people around the world.\n\nFounded in 1998 with its headquarters in Shenzhen, China, Tencent's guiding principle is to use technology for good.

        "content": "Big Tech companies, from Tencent Holdings to Microsoft and Amazon.com, have rushed to pitch their artificial intelligence (AI) tools to Chinese video gaming firms at ChinaJoy, the country's biggest annual digital entertainment expo in Shanghai.\n\nShenzhen-based Tencent, which runs the world's biggest video gaming business by revenue, is offering a range of AI services to cover the \"full life cycle\" of game development, Tencent Cloud Internet Industry general manager Chen Liang told the South China Morning Post on Friday at ChinaJoy, which concludes on Sunday.\n\n\"AI has been used in video games as early as the 1990s,\" Chen said. \"But the current generative AI (GenAI) boom has raised people's expectations of the entire market.\"\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nCiting an example, Chen said large language models - the technology underpinning GenAI services like ChatGPT - have helped shorten the time for content generation in video games. \"There are many things we want to do in the future, including using AI in character production, scene production and making bots,\" he said.\n\nVideo gamers try out new products at the opening of the three-day ChinaJoy digital entertainment expo in Shanghai on Friday.

Photo: Weibo>\n\nTencent Cloud, which is responsible for the internet giant's AI operations, has been working on Wuthering Waves - a hit action role-playing mobile game developed by Guangzhou-based Kuro Games - since the project was started several years ago, according to Chen.\n\nThe Tencent unit accounts for 42.9 per cent of cloud services adoption in the domestic gaming sector during the second half of 2023, the company cited an IDC report as saying. The report also said more than 90 per cent of China's top gaming companies, including Perfect World and 37Games, use Tencent Cloud's solutions.\n\nCloud computing technology enables companies to distribute, manage or process over the internet a range of software and other digital resources as an on-demand service, just like electricity from a power grid. These resources are stored inside data centres, where AI systems training is typically done.\n\nThe positive response to GenAI advances at ChinaJoy reflects the continued optimism for further developing and expanding adoption of the technology in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nGaming enthusiasts flock to the exhibition space of Blizzard Entertainment, a unit of Microsoft-owned Activision Blizzard, and Chinese partner NetEase at the opening of the annual ChinaJoy digital entertainment expo in Shanghai on Friday.

Through Microsoft's Azure OpenAI, Beijing-based Perfect World is able to create non-player characters and digital humans, according to the company.\n\nJohnny Tian, a vice-president at Microsoft Greater China Region, said at ChinaJoy that the US tech company's \"huge AI system\" will continue to support the overseas expansion plans of Chinese game developers.\n\nAmazon Web Services, meanwhile, has been supporting various Chinese video gaming studios to improve their workflow efficiency through its Amazon Bedrock service, according to Zhang Xiaofeng, gaming principal architect at the Seattle-based firm. These include analysing user comments for ByteDance-owned Moonton Technology, and operations and maintenance management at Shanghai-based Lilith Games.\n\n\"The [emergence of] generative AI is similar to the invention of the steam engine,\" Zhang said. \"It can bring about an industrial revolution in the video game industry.\"\n\nA cosplayer poses for photos at the booth of Huawei Technologies' HarmonyOS platform on Friday at the opening of the annual ChinaJoy digital entertainment expo in Shanghai.

He pointed out that developers are trying to strike a balance between achieving quality with AI applications, while managing the cost of computing power consumption.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Chinese technology giants Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings have rushed to offer the latest artificial intelligence (AI) model from Facebook owner Meta Platforms into their cloud services, as the debut of Llama 3.1 drew widespread attention this week.\n\nAlibaba Cloud, the e-commerce giant's online computing platform, was among the first to include the latest open-source Llama family of large language models (LLMs) - the technology underpinning generative AI products such as ChatGPT - by integrating it into its Bailian model training platform, the company said on Tuesday in a post published to its official WeChat account. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nAlibaba said it is offering one month of free compute resources that can be used for training and inferencing tasks with Llama 3.1, which launched on Monday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nMeta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses his company's powerful new AI model, Llama 3.1, with Bloomberg. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses his company's powerful new AI model, Llama 3.1, with Bloomberg. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nShenzhen-based video gaming giant Tencent quickly followed with its own announcement the same day, saying Llama 3.1 is now available on its cloud platform. It includes a number of fine-tuning and inferencing tweaks to ensure Meta's open source models are usable in a range of areas, from intelligent conversation, text generation and writing tasks, according to the company.\n\nMeta is offering the latest version of Llama in three different sizes - 8B, 70B and 450B - that are named after the billions of parameters they include. The number of parameters generally corresponds with an LLM's level of sophistication.\n\nIn its unveiling, Meta hailed Llama 3.1 as \"the first frontier-level open-source AI model\". Early tests have compared it favourably with leading closed-source models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o.\n\nWidely considered the best-performing open-source LLM family, Llama models have become a default foundation model that many Chinese start-ups use to build their own generative AI products, typically with custom tweaks to change or improve performance.\n\nChinese industry insiders have cautioned against an over-reliance on Meta's models among domestic generative AI initiatives. Last year, Chinese AI unicorn 01.AI, founded by venture capitalist Lee Kai-fu, generated some controversy when it was found to be building on top of Llama models without being transparent about it.\n\nStory continues\n\nResponding to criticism that advanced open-source models benefit China, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement announcing the new models on Monday that \"decentralised and open innovation\" advantages the US.\n\n\"Our adversaries are great at espionage, stealing models that fit on a thumb drive is relatively easy, and most tech companies are far from operating in a way that would make this more difficult,\" he said.\n\nWhile open-source models have typically lagged behind the most advanced in the industry, Zuckerberg said he expects to close that gap soon. \"Starting next year, we expect future Llama models to become the most advanced in the industry,\" he wrote in his statement posted to Facebook.\n\nLMSYS, an AI model research organisation supported by the University of California, Berkeley, currently ranks closed-source models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google as the top as the best performing. OpenAI's GPT-4o ranks No 1, with the three companies' other models filling out most of the other top 10 spots.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Baichuan AI, one of China's four so-called artificial intelligence (AI) tigers, raised about 5 billion yuan (US$687.6 million) in a new funding round that valued the start-up at more than 20 billion yuan, the company said on Thursday.\n\nThe Beijing-based firm's latest round was backed by some of the biggest names in Chinese technology, including Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings and Xiaomi, along with some state-backed funds. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nChina International Capital Corporation, the AI industrial investment fund backed by the municipal governments of Beijing and Shanghai, as well as Shenzhen Capital Group, one of the largest yuan-denominated venture funds set up by the southern tech hub's government in 1999, are among the participants.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe sizeable funding round illustrates how local investors continue to pump money into the red-hot AI industry at a time when US funds are steering clear amid geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nFounded in April 2023 by Wang Xiaochuan - founder and former CEO of Sogou, once China's second-largest search engine operator after Baidu - Baichuan has seen its valuation swell past US$2.7 billion in a matter of months, becoming China's second-most valuable AI start-up behind crosstown rival Moonshot AI, valued at US$3 billion and also backed by Alibaba.\n\nChina's biggest e-commerce and cloud services operator has emerged as one of the most prolific backers of Chinese AI start-ups, with stakes in all four AI tigers, which also includes Beijing-based Zhipu AI and Shanghai-based MiniMax.\n\nAlibaba is actively developing its own large language models (LLMs), as well, which include its proprietary Tongyi Qianwen series and the open source version called Qwen. The push comes as the Hangzhou-based tech giant seeks to entrench its position in what has become a highly competitive domestic AI market.\n\nQwen2 was ranked the world's best performing open-source model by LLM community Hugging Face when it was unveiled just after its launch last month. Facebook owner Meta Platforms is now claiming that title for its Llama 3.1 model unveiled on Monday, underscoring just how fast the industry is moving.\n\nBaichuan's new funding round comes less than two months after it introduced in late May the latest iteration of its namesake LLM - the technology behind chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. Alongside Baichuan 4, the company introduced a dedicated digital assistant with the aim of turning its Baixiaoying chatbot app into a super app that can encompass all aspects of a person's digital life, a la Tencent's WeChat.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Some of China's biggest tech companies, including Baidu, Tencent Holdings and TikTok owner ByteDance, have embarked on a worldwide search for top talent to strengthen their research into cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors and autonomous driving.\n\nAs soon as the spring semester finished, companies kicked off their annual campus recruitment drives, with some efforts targeting final-year doctorate candidates in the field of AI.\n\nBaidu, which has invested heavily in large language models (LLMs), the technology behind ChatGPT-like chat bots, as well as AI-powered self driving technology, said its campaign will focus on those with expertise in LLMs, computer vision, self driving and integrated circuit design. Ideal candidates would be students who will graduate between September this year and August 2025, according to a social media post by the company in late June.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe campaign aims at \"recruiting top campus talent in AI and cultivating AI technology leaders\", the firm said. Baidu, which also runs China's top search engine, has been shifting its focus on AI. It was the first Chinese firm to have rolled out an AI chat bot, called Ernie Bot, three months after ChatGPT's launch, and has deployed a fleet of nearly 500 driverless robotaxis in Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province.\n\nThe Apollo logo is seen on a Baidu driverless robotaxi in Wuhan, Hubei province on February 24, 2023.

Photo: Reuters>\n\nTencent, the social media and video gaming giant, has a similar programme to attract \"top tech students across the globe\" to join the company in 10 technical fields including LLMs, game engines, robotics and quantum computing, the company announced earlier this month.\n\nAnyone who graduates between January 2023 and December 2025 can apply. The job openings are not only in China, but in other major economies including the US, UK, Singapore and the Netherlands. Besides PhD students, those with a bachelor's or master's degree are also welcome, the company said.\n\nByteDance, the owner of TikTok and its Chinese version Douyin, whose success largely relies on AI-powered recommendation algorithms, is looking for PhD students to further advance its search and recommendation capabilities. Those who specialise in robotics, cybersecurity and hardware will also be eligible for ByteDance's recruitment programme announced two weeks earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is looking for students who will graduate with a PhD between September and August 2025, and they can choose to work in major Chinese cities or at ByteDance US offices in San Jose and Seattle.\n\nThe companies have promised \"competitive compensation\" and \"comprehensive training\" in a bid to lure the world's best tech talent, who are also up for grabs by western tech giants and academia.\n\nTencent has launched a programme to attract top tech students across the globe.

Photo: Shutterstock Images>\n\nPhD graduates have long preferred university and research institutes when seeking jobs, but the balance is tilting towards industry given the prominence of technologies like AI. Nearly 70 per cent of AI PhDs joined corporations in 2020, compared to only 21 per cent in 2004, according to 2023 research by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Virginia Tech.\n\nThe pursuit of higher quality talent in fields such as AI and semiconductors by China's Big Tech companies also fits with Beijing's drive for tech self sufficiency, to counteract export restrictions imposed by the US over national security concerns. For example, ChatGPT developer OpenAI recently banned China-based developers from accessing its services via its application programming interface, spurring growth of local alternatives.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Shenzhen tech giants deepen rift as Huawei app store list snubs Tencent's video games",
        "content": "Multiple video game titles from Tencent Holdings have disappeared from the top lists of the app store of smartphone maker Huawei Technologies, in sign of a deepening dispute between the two Shenzhen-based tech giants.\n\nAs of Friday, almost all of Tencent's mobile games have disappeared from the top game rankings of Huawei's app store, leaving three NetEase games - Eggy Party, Identity V and Fantasy Westward Journey - in the top positions.\n\nA previous ranking on June 18 saw two Tencent titles - action role-playing game Dungeon & Fighter (DnF) Mobile and strategy game The Golden Spatula - rank first and eighth, respectively, on the list of bestselling games in the Huawei app store, according to a report by Chinese gaming media Gamelook earlier this week. It was unclear when the Tencent titles were removed from the lists.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nTencent and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.\n\nThe Tencent Games logo (left) and Huawei logo are show on smartphone screens. Photo: Shutterstock Images alt=The Tencent Games logo (left) and Huawei logo are show on smartphone screens. Photo: Shutterstock Images>\n\nThe rift between Tencent and Huawei was laid bare a month ago after the video gaming giant pulled its hit title DnF Mobile from the Huawei store.\n\nThat move came after Tencent removed DnF Mobile - a runaway hit which is expected to gross around 6 billion yuan (US$826 million) annually - from the shelves of Android-based platforms, including those of Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, from June 20.\n\nThe company said in a notice at the time that the removal was because the contracts with those Chinese Android smartphone vendors expired less than a month after the video game's launch.\n\nEven though Tencent titles, other than DnF Mobile, are still available for download through the search function in the Huawei app store, the latest development shows a continuation of the long-running dispute between Tencent, which operates the world's biggest video gaming business by revenue, and mainland Chinese distribution channels.\n\nA screenshot of Tencent's Dungeon & Fighter (DnF) Mobile game. Photo: Handout alt=A screenshot of Tencent's Dungeon & Fighter (DnF) Mobile game. Photo: Handout>\n\nTencent's games reappeared after a few hours on Huawei's app store, with both sides claiming that their dispute was solved \"after friendly negotiations\". Neither Huawei nor Tencent has offered an explanation for what happened.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the situation may change in future, as Huawei's HarmonyOS is on its way to break the dominance of Western mobile operating systems in mainland China, especially after its next version HarmonyOS Next ends support for Androidapps. After that, the two tech giants may have to renegotiate their terms on mobile game distribution.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks That Will Have Better Returns Than META",
        "content": "Less than two years ago, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) hit lows of $90 per share. Now, the company is a trillion-dollar titan at nearly $500 a share. Many of us, whether short-term or long-term investors, look forward to the day we can get lucky enough to hit a multi-bagger like META. However, there are plenty of other social media stocks worth your investment. Having said that, how do you find them?\n\nOne of the best ways to do so is through a simple investment strategy known as Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP).\u00a0With GARP, investors should focus on companies with strong fundamentals, a large moat usually attached to market share, margin expansion, and high revenue growth.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll cover stocks that I believe have a setup that META had in 2022. By using the GARP principles, these three stocks could be social media multi-baggers in the making!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeing an AI innovator, search engine giant, and social media superstar, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is truly one-of-a-kind. This unique moat has positioned Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the world by market cap.\n\nThe company has an 81.95% market share in the search engine industry with its subsidiary, YouTube, holding a market share of 97.67%. Not surprisingly, Alphabet\u2019s financials are stellar with 57.2% year-over-year net income growth and 15.4% year-over-year growth in revenue to $80.54 billion. Its balance sheet holds just $30 billion in total debt compared to $110 billion in cash & equivalents.\n\nSo how is Alphabet continuing to fuel growth as a $2.3 trillion company? First, Alphabet is cost-cutting, having laid off more than 12,000 employees in 2023 alone. This contributed to its operating margin increasing to 32% from 25%. Second, it\u2019s heavily investing in its technical infrastructure to support AI and Cloud growth. In Q1 alone, Alphabet\u2019s CapEx was $12 billion, driven by investments in servers and data centers to develop its Gemini models. Lastly, Google is integrating this AI infrastructure into its current product line. YouTube cycles a host of generative AI tools, which led to 50% more channels uploading YouTube Shorts. This led to a 21% year-over-year rise in ad revenues.\n\nSpotify Technology SA (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a market share of 30.5%, Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) is the leader in the music streaming market. It is also second in the podcast market, housing 28.2% of podcast listeners. This only adds to the company\u2019s extensive monthly active user (MAU) count of 615 million with 44% of them using the platform daily. This reinforces Spotify\u2019s networking effect: as more users use the platform, friends and family will join as well. Features like Spotify Wrapped add a true social dimension to the app.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonthly active users reach new all-time highs growing 19% year-over-year leading to quarterly revenues of $3.64 billion up about 20% year-over-year. Starting in July, the company announced price hikes for its individual, duo, and family plans by 9%, 13.3%, and 17.7% respectively.\n\nProvided that the company has had a historical monthly churn rate of just 2% and given that its customer conversion rate is 44%, I do not believe these price hikes will significantly impact the company\u2019s user base. SPOT trades at 3.9x sales and has a 0.8-forward Price to earnings ratio divided by its annual EPS Growth (PEG ratio). This is low relative to other music streamers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at 1.39 or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 2.8.\u00a0This is easily one of the best social media stocks on the market.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent (NASDAQ:TCEHY), is China\u2019s largest company and operates in social media, gaming, and eCommerce. While the company\u2019s revenues have grown by 26% since 2020 the stock is down 50% from its all-time high.\n\nIt has a staggering 47% market share in the global gaming industry. Tencent\u2019s WeChat super-app hosts 1.3 billion monthly active users. This is nearly twice the users of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) which has 676 million monthly active users. Net margins were up 50% quarter-over-quarter driven by improved digital advertising through its AI-powered ad targeting.\n\nTencent has a stellar lineup of games including Fight of Golden Spatula which broke mobile records in China. Other games under Tencent\u2019s umbrella include Valorant, PUBG Mobile, and League of Legends. With more than 140 games and $135 million in annual gross revenue per game, any new release adds to Tencent\u2019s high-margin top-line growth.\n\nAt first glance, TCEHY trades at more than double the EV/EBITDA of peers like Baidu and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). But stronger growth metrics justify shares trading at 14.62x and 16.4x forward earnings. Quarterly revenue growth grew six times that of Baidu\u2019s while net profit margins are 50% higher than BABA.\u00a0If you are looking for the top social media stocks, start here.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The metaverse has already been through quite the boom-and-bust cycle. The concept burst onto the scene a few years ago, reaching its pinnacle when Mark Zuckerberg renamed his company from Facebook to\u00a0Meta\u00a0Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Zuckerberg felt that the metaverse would be a key growth avenue, and the company made a splashy Super Bowl ad to highlight its new direction.\n\nHowever, growth hasn\u2019t been nearly as easy as anticipated. Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds has seen sparse usership thus far. And other tech innovations such as AI have sucked up the oxygen from metaverse investments.\n\nBut the concept of an online meeting space where people can work, collaborate, socialize and play games together remains compelling. And rapid technological advances will broaden the possibilities of the range of experiences in an augmented reality setting.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investing in the augmented reality (AR) space, metaverse stocks possibly could be in for another big run. These are three leading candidates that will prosper if the sector takes off.\n\nUnity (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity (NYSE:U) is one of the two primary graphics engines that video game developers use to produce their games.\n\nUnity\u2019s biggest appeal is its interoperability. A developer can build a game in Unity and quickly release it across console, PC, smartphone, AR and virtual reality (VR). In fact, reports suggested that Mark Zuckerberg considered acquiring Unity to make it a core part of the Oculus ecosystem.\n\nHowever, Unity remained independent. And with U stock now down more than 90% from its all-time highs, shares are near their cheapest ever available price. That could make for a remarkable buying opportunity as Unity gains momentum via partnerships such as its development role for the\u00a0Apple Vision Pro.\n\nUnity has struggled with monetization, and it generated developer pushback with an unpopular planned price hike last year. The company has had its issues. So, it\u2019s understandable that shares have slipped. But the fall has been excessive, particularly as the company swings to profitability going forward. Any improvement in metaverse sentiment will further speed up the ensuing recover in Unity\u2019s stock price.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is one of China\u2019s leading tech companies. Run as a conglomerate, TCEHY owns and operates a broad array of businesses while maintaining ownership stakes in numerous other companies as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that China\u2019s economy has been in a tailspin recently, and investors have shunned the country\u2019s stocks. That includes TCEHY shares, which are down almost 50 percent from their all-time highs. At just 16 times forward earnings, Tencent Holdings is an excellent way to play the recovery in the Chinese technology space.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a leading metaverse property as well. Tencent Holdings is a leading video game developer, and it also invests in other peers in that space. In particular, its large holding in Epic Games gives it a particular leg up in the\u00a0metaverse\u00a0space.\n\nThat\u2019s because Epic runs\u00a0Fortnite, which is arguably the most successful metaverse\u00a0property to date. Fortnite has gained incredible mind share with younger players which has allowed it to attract large international brands who have set up digital stores in the Fortnite universe. Additionally, Fortnite hosts concerts and media events which attract players for unique experiences and allow all sorts of branding, product sales and other monetization opportunities.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) sign near Qualcomm Research Silicon Valley office of San Diego based chip and semiconductor company\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a large semiconductor company focused on the mobile communications market.\n\nHistorically, Qualcomm built its business by designing and licensing the 3G and then 4G technologies that underpin modern mobile communications technology. Qualcomm is pivotal in 5G rollouts now. Yet, it has also diversified, such as with its Snapdragon platform for smartphones and tablets.\n\nThat brings us to Qualcomm\u2019s cutting-edge technologies. The company\u2019s stock has soared over the past year thanks to its AI-enabled chips, which can power leading AI applications in a mobile setting.\n\nIn addition, Qualcomm is investing heavily in the metaverse. It has set aside $100 million for its Snapdragon Metaverse Fund to foster innovation in the space. And Qualcomm is positioning its combination of 5G, spatial intelligence, advanced hardware and high-sensitive cameras as key tools to power up future metaverse experiences.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in U, META, and QCOM stock.

        "content": "There was a great deal of uncertainty surrounding Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its AI strategy (or lack of one) entering this year. With the first half now over, investors now have more understanding of where Apple is headed in the AI age. Indeed, the Cupertino-based innovator is shooting for intelligence (note the lack of \u201cartificial\u201d) that\u2019s not only useful and applied, but safe and private. Indeed, perhaps a slow and deliberate approach could be a strike of brilliance.\n\nFor now, Apple has chosen to partner with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence. In the future, Apple users will likely have more than one large language model (LLM) to pick from.\n\nIn China, a huge market for Apple, there won\u2019t be a ChatGPT-powered iOS 18 coming later this year. According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple is looking to pair up with a Chinese AI firm to bring a local LLM to the Chinese iPhone-using public. These are three powerful candidates with whom Apple may wish to strike a deal.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) would be an excellent Chinese internet firm to partner to bring AI to the Chinese masses. The company\u2019s Ernie bot is comparable to ChatGPT but has one notable difference: it\u2019s trained to comply with the Cyberspace Administration of China. Undoubtedly, having an LLM that plays by the rules of Chinese regulators is paramount. If an AI model doesn\u2019t play by their rules, it could easily get shut down, and the firm behind the model could receive stiff fines.\n\nUndoubtedly, the high degree of regulatory risk makes releasing an in-house LLM so risky for Apple. The good news is that teaming up with a third party like Baidu would offshore a great deal of that risk.\n\nApart from Ernie AI\u2019s smarts, BIDU stock looks to be trading at a fat discount with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 11.8x. Even if Baidu doesn\u2019t win a deal with Apple, its latest version of Ernie (4.0 Turbo) could have the potential to be a profound success. It already has 300 million users.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo displayed on a phone screen\n\nSource: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Baidu, Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is a Chinese tech company that\u2019s lost its way. After having shed more than 75% of its value, BABA stock looks severely undervalued deep-value for investors seeking growth from AI and e-commerce. With a P/E of 17.1, BABA is also much cheaper than comparable firms in the U.S. market.\n\nWith experience integrating AI across different products, perhaps Alibaba is a strong candidate to team up with the iPhone maker. It\u2019s not just Alibaba\u2019s LLM, Tongyi Qianwen, that\u2019s impressive, but the firm\u2019s ability to tailor AI to specific applications that may make an Alibaba-powered Apple Intelligence experience that much more delightful.\n\nStory continues\n\nUndoubtedly, a deal with Apple would mean wonders for the stock. However, Alibaba needs to prove it\u2019s a cut above rivals. The company has shown it\u2019s \u201call-in\u201d on AI, with its own models, integrations, and investment in other AI startups, including Beijing\u2019s Baichuan AI. And let\u2019s not forget about Alibaba\u2019s impressive cloud expertise, which would likely be an asset in Apple\u2019s eyes.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is another internet juggernaut looking to place big bets on China\u2019s AI future. Like Alibaba, Tencent also helped fund Baichuan AI, a firm that may have the Chinese AI model to beat.\n\nTencent\u2019s intelligent network, Xingmai, may set Tencent apart from the pack when Apple finally decides. Of course, only time will tell which AI firm wins the right to be in the next generation of AI-enabled Chinese iPhones, iPads, and Vision Pros.\n\nThe main reason for owning the stock has to be the impressive video-gaming exposure. Though Tencent must play within Chinese regulators\u2019 rules, I appreciate the company\u2019s ability to engage and monetize with its intriguing mobile gaming titles.

        "content": "There\u2019s a popular perception that investors have to look at smaller companies to find the biggest gains. And, sure, there is a grain of truth to the underlying sentiment.\n\nBut there can often be tremendous bargains in larger household-name companies as well. That\u2019s particularly true in the current market. Where semiconductors and AI enthusiasm have sucked up most of the oxygen, many other sectors have gotten lost in the shuffle.\n\nThese three undervalued large-cap stocks to buy today are all shockingly cheap. In fact, Morningstar\u2019s analysts have tabbed all three of these leading companies as five-star stocks. meaning they are among the best bargain buys available right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPfizer (PFE) Here's How Pfizer Stock (and Pharma) Stand to Benefit From Mylan Deal. Best Biotech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s been a tale of two extremes within the pharmaceutical industry. For drug developers that have an approved GLP-1 drug in the diabetes management and weight loss space, it is the best of times. For everyone else, such as Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), doom and gloom rule the day.\n\nPFE stock, in particular, has been on a roller coaster. Shares rocketed higher during the pandemic as investors applauded the company\u2019s huge revenue stream from its blockbuster COVID-19 vaccine. But as those revenues have declined, PFE stock has imploded.\n\nIncredibly enough, Pfizer shares traded for around $40 prior to the onset of the pandemic but change hands for just $28 now. Given that Pfizer has far higher revenues now than it did in 2019, it is rather odd. Specifically, Pfizer generated $51 billion in revenues in 2019 and is on pace to bring in about $60 billion this year.\n\nNeedless to say, Pfizer isn\u2019t worth dramatically less now than it was five years ago. Today, shares trade at just 12 times forward earnings and offer a healthy 6% dividend yield. And once the company\u2019s investments in cancer therapeutics pay off, shares could soar.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent stock TCEHY stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a large Chinese technology and media conglomerate. It both operates its own business and maintains investment stakes in a vast array of companies.\n\nTencent shares have fallen from a peak of around $100 per share in 2021 to just half that today. China\u2019s continuing economic slump and pullback in consumer spending have hit the whole sector hard.\n\nBut investors shouldn\u2019t count out Tencent by any means. The company is tremendously diversified and has many ways to profit once the Chinese economy picks back up.\n\nThe firm also has numerous opportunities to make money in overseas markets, such as its shrewd investments in the video gaming space. Tencent\u2019s holdings in developers such as Epic Games, which operates Fortnite, give it tremendous reach internationally and with younger consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nTECHY stock is now going for just 16 times forward earnings. That\u2019s a great bargain for a company set to grow revenues by around 8% this year and earnings at a double-digit pace even amid China\u2019s current economic troubles.\n\nNike (NKE) The swoosh logo for Nike Inc (NKE) is displayed on a wall made of wood panels.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is on a big losing streak. Incredibly enough, NKE stock is down 30% over the past 12 months and down significantly over the past five-year period as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s gone wrong for Nike? For one thing, apparel is a fast-moving business and some of Nike\u2019s recent product designs are currently out of line with current fashion trends. But the bigger problems are in the macroeconomy.\n\nNike is heavily involved in the Asian market and thus has taken a steep hit as the Chinese consumer pulled back. More recently, North American sales have softened considerably as people have reduced their spending amid high inflation and a slowing economy.\n\nNike stock recently fell 20% in a single day, marking its worst one-day decline since 2001. That came on a weak earnings report. There\u2019s no doubt Nike is stuck in the penalty box right now. But its tremendous brands, unmatched distribution and leading celebrity marketing arrangements will get Nike back in the game as soon as economic conditions brighten.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in PFE and NKE stock.

        "content": "If you\u2019re looking for relative value in tech after the meteoric rise of the Nasdaq 100 and the Magnificent Seven in the first half, perhaps the social media scene is worth checking out this July. Undoubtedly, the artificial intelligence revolution will change many industries in profound ways that are difficult for some to fathom.\n\nWhen it comes to social media, AI has already begun to make an impact. And it\u2019s not just AI behind the scenes, either, with social-media titan Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) showing off AI personas to users. Such consumer-facing AIs are intriguing, even entertaining, but they\u2019re likely just a hint of what\u2019s to come from the AI-first social media and metaverse company.\n\nAs Meta\u2019s AI, or LLaMA, becomes more capable with every additional billion spent on advancing the technology, rival social-media firms should seek to borrow from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s growth playbook and look to AI to boost engagement and enhance the ad business.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nReddit (RDDT) Reddit (RDDT) app logo on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Henry Franklin / Shutterstock.com\n\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) looks to be a huge IPO success story, with the stock now up around 60% from its opening day close of $46 per share. Undoubtedly, Tuesday\u2019s 10% pop powered RDDT stock to a new all-time high of $73 and change.\n\nIndeed, Reddit\u2019s traffic has been soaring of late, up 39% for May, according to a report issued by Similarweb. And, no, the boom isn\u2019t about the latest meme stock frenzy surrounding Roaring Kitty and his latest bets.\n\nReddit has been used onAlphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google search in recent months. In an age where AI content is scattered throughout the web, many people likely seek a human perspective.\n\nAnd with Reddit, they\u2019re getting just that. It\u2019s no wonder why Google is becoming a stepping stone for many seeking an answer to a question, minus the risk of getting an AI-generated hallucination.\n\nWith a mere $12.04 billion market cap, RDDT stock still has a high growth ceiling. And in the age of AI, perhaps there\u2019s more room for the underrated social-media play to fly.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms is in the Magnificent Seven for a reason: it\u2019s a growth company that\u2019s comfortable stepping outside of its circle of competence into new frontiers \u2014 think AI and the metaverse.\n\nOf course, jumping into an unproven, emerging market can be risky. But so, too, can being complacent and not taking any risks. As a proven capital allocator, investors should trust Zuckerberg as he positions the firm to take only smart, strategic risks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn any case, Meta doesn\u2019t seem to have lost its competitive spirit, as it shoots to become even more magnificent than its six mega-cap tech peers. Though the company has been subject to regulatory scrutiny lately, specifically from the European Union, such news is mostly noise.\n\nAt the end of the day, Meta is all about going big or going home. When it comes to AI, Meta is not afraid to open up the checkbook to spend on efforts to advance its positioning in the AI race.\n\nGiven what Meta has to gain by swinging for the fences, META stock is a relative AI stock bargain at 29.3 times trailing price-to-earnings.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a Chinese internet titan behind the popular social media app Weixin, also known as WeChat, and various video-game studios. On the surface, Weixen seems like just another rival of WhatsApp for Chinese users.\n\nWhile Weixen is used for keeping up with friends via messaging, the app is also used for posting Moments, similarly to a Facebook feed) paying for things and even running mini-programs. It\u2019s the ultimate super app, with more than 1.3 billion users. It also provides a common interface, regardless of the smartphone or mobile operating system being used.\n\nAt 29.9 times trailing P/E, TCHEY stock looks too cheap, especially given its monopolistic positioning with Chinese users and the ability to upsell them with new services.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Alphabet (Class C).

This undervaluation persists even as BYD's revenue and earnings are expected to outpace the Hong Kong market with forecasts of 13.7% and 14.8% annual growth respectively. However, it's crucial to consider that while profit increased by over 50% last year, future earnings growth isn't projected to be extraordinarily high, tempering some expectations for long-term performance acceleration.\n\nUpon reviewing our latest growth report, BYD's projected financial performance appears quite optimistic.

Despite lower profit margins year-over-year (21.2% from 33.5%), the company's earnings are expected to grow by 14.6% annually, outpacing the Hong Kong market's 11.2%. Additionally, recent share buyback programs could enhance shareholder value by potentially increasing net asset value and earnings per share, reflecting positive management actions to utilize capital effectively.\n\nInsights from our recent growth report point to a promising forecast for Tencent Holdings' business outlook.

        "title": "Tencent boosts AI training efficiency without Nvidia's most advanced chips",
        "content": "Tencent Holdings has upgraded its high-performance computing (HPC) network, with an improvement to its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, as Chinese tech giants seek ways to boost large language model (LLM) training with existing systems and equipment amid a domestic push for technological self-reliance.\n\nThe 2.0 version of Tencent's Intelligent High-Performance Network, known as Xingmai in Chinese, will improve the efficiency of network communications and LLM training by 60 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, the company's cloud unit said on Monday.\n\nThe performance enhancement comes as China looks for ways to advance its AI ambitions with restricted access to advanced chips from Nvidia owing to strict US export rules. China's most valuable tech giant achieved the performance gains by optimising existing facilities rather than trying to compete head-to-head with US rivals such as OpenAI in terms of spending and cutting-edge semiconductors.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAn HPC network connects clusters of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) to process data and solve problems at extremely high speeds.\n\nUnder pre-existing HPC networking technologies, computing clusters were spending too much time communicating with other clusters, leaving a significant portion of GPU capacity idling, according to Tencent. So the company upgraded its network to speed up the communications process while reducing costs, it said.\n\nThe Xingmai network can support a single computing cluster with more than 100,000 GPUs, according to the company, doubling the scale from the initial version of the network released in 2023. The improved performance shortens the time needed for identifying problems to just minutes, down from days previously, Tencent said.\n\nTencent has recently made a big push to strengthen its technologies in the rapidly growing AI field. The Shenzhen-based firm has been promoting its in-house LLMs for enterprise use, and also has services helping other companies to build their own models.\n\nThe swift uptake of generative AI service has led China's AI industry to become locked in a price war that has seen all the major players slash their prices to well below what Western firms offer, as companies look for greater commercialisation of their technologies.\n\nIn May, Tencent made the lite version of its Hunyuan LLM free of charge while cutting prices for its standard versions. This came after competitors including TikTok owner ByteDance, Baidu and e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding made similar moves. Alibaba owns the Post.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe race to improve the efficiency of model training, an energy-intensive and expensive process, is crucial in the price war by making the technology more affordable for the operators and their clients.\n\nRobin Li Yanhong, founder and CEO of Baidu, said in April that the efficiency of training its flagship Ernie LLM had improved more than fivefold within a year. The model's inferencing performance increased 105 times, reducing inferencing costs by 99 per cent, he said.\n\nOpenAI also credited recent efficiency gains as the reason for the much lower pricing of its GPT-4o model launched in May.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Goldman Sachs added Chinese internet giant Tencent to its APAC Conviction List- a list of 20-30 stocks it is bullish on in the region, while removing social media firm Kuaishou.\n\nTencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) replaced Kuaishou Technology (HK:1024) as the only internet sector pick on the list, which is otherwise largely populated by consumer, financials and technology stocks.\n\nGoldman Sachs rates Tencent at a Buy with a target price of HK$477 with a 29% total return potential over the next 12 months.\n\nThe brokerage said that Tencent presents one of the \u201cmost visible and sustainable 20%+ profit growth set-ups amongst Chinese internet stocks.\u201d\n\nTencent is expected to benefit from accelerated games revenue growth in both domestic and international markets on new titles, while the advertising market is also expected to improve.\n\nTencent\u2019s commitment to shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends also made the stock appear attractive, GS said.\n\nTencent was trading up 24% so far in 2024, having benefited from a mix of bargain buying and expectations that the firm will benefit from a recovery in China, its biggest market. Optimism over the firm\u2019s adoption of artificial intelligence also boosted the stock this year.\n\nBut the stock was also nursing three years of steep losses following increased government in China and concerns over slowing demand in the country.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman Sachs adds Tencent to APAC conviction list, Kuaishou out\n\nAustralia's ANZ sanctioned for charging fees from dead customers\n\nChina property firms jump after big developers show smaller sales drop\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tencent Holdings is closing down its 10-year-old online education platform with more than 400 million users, as the Chinese video gaming and social media giant continues to cut noncore operations.\n\nThe professional education service Tencent Ketang, which translates to \"classroom\" in English, will cease operations on October 1, according to a notice posted on its website, without providing any reason.\n\nWhile users will no longer be able to access new courses on the platform from August 1, they can still watch lessons that have already been added to their schedules until the site is closed, the notice said.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Handout alt=The landing page of the Tencent Ketang website. Photo: Handout>\n\nShuttering the online education service shows Tencent's focus on its restructuring strategy, about a year and half after founder, chairman and chief executive Pony Ma Huateng said the company must get into a habit of cutting costs and finding core areas, instead of seeking expansion and scale.\n\n\"In the past, when we saw others were adding weight, we also tried to increase in size, but what we added was just fat, and we were still unable to defeat others,\" Ma said in a December 2022 internal town hall meeting, which was quoted in a report by Chinese media outlet Jiemian.\n\nTencent's cost-cutting efforts have included divesting some of its investment portfolio, closing noncore businesses, and consolidating its sprawling operations across social media, video gaming and other market segments amid economic headwinds and a lengthy regulatory crackdown.\n\nLast December, Tencent offloaded its loss-making animation and comics business to subsidiary China Literature, the country's largest online publishing and e-book company in a 600 million yuan (US$83.6 million) deal. In the same month, Tencent closed its seven-year-old live-streaming service Now as part of \"business adjustments\".\n\nTencent Holdings founder, chairman and chief executive Pony Ma Huateng says the company must focus on its core businesses.

A year earlier, the platform recorded more than 400 million users.\n\nTencent Holdings remains involved in education technology, as it runs an artificial-intelligence-powered teaching tool.

The company also offers its technologies to various schools and organisations.\n\nOnline education was a booming sector on the mainland during the Covid-19 pandemic, as it provided an alternative to the disrupted lessons in bricks-and-mortar classrooms.\n\nE-learning platforms like Tencent Ketang, however, saw increased competition from Bilibili and other video-streaming sites that offered education content.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A hot new online game is refueling investor optimism for Tencent Holdings Ltd., driving China\u2019s biggest stock boost of 2024.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho SpaceX Tender Offer Said to Value Company at Record $210 Billion Supreme Court Ends OxyContin Settlement, Cracking Sackler Shield China\u2019s Finance Elite Face $400,000 Pay Cap, Bonus Clawbacks Bolivia\u2019s President Arce Swears in New Army Chief After Coup Bid\n\nIts shares have rallied 28% so far this year with help from the strong debut of Dungeon & Fighter Mobile, adding $91 billion in market value, more than any other Chinese company. Improved regulatory and business climates in the company\u2019s key markets are also helping drive expectations.\n\nAnalyst price targets have risen to the highest level in two years, while earnings estimates have jumped more than 14% since the start of the year to a record high. Options traders are turning more bullish as well, with the put-to-call ratio falling from a recent high after the launch of DnF Mobile in late May.\n\n\u201cCapital inflows will go to Tencent first,\u201d said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. The stock is rising on a \u201cmore positive outlook as its game segment has returned to growth and its advertising business is taking market share.\u201d\n\nTencent\u2019s New Blockbuster Game Exceeds $270 Million in 30 Days\n\nTencent is among the best-performers in the global game sector this year, with its Hong Kong-listed shares outpacing gains in peers from NetEase Inc. to Nintendo Co. It\u2019s also regained its position as Asia\u2019s second-largest stock, now behind only Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\n\nDnF Mobile has secured the top spot in China\u2019s game app ranks since its debut, spurring hopes Tencent may have found its next blockbuster. Expectations are also high for the company\u2019s Honour of Fight due later this year as well as Squad Busters, the first new game in five years from its Finnish unit Supercell Oy.\n\n\u201cGiven current datapoints, we believe it is reasonable to conclude DnF Mobile will be China\u2019s biggest new game launch in 2024 and Tencent\u2019s most commercially successful new game in the past five years,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts Ronald Keung and Lincoln Kong wrote in a note. The broker has raised its price target for Tencent 17% since April.\n\nChina Game Tracker: Tencent Regaining Its China Video Game Mojo\n\nAmid Beijing\u2019s broad efforts to support markets and businesses, its approval of DnF Mobile in February signaled an easier stance on the game industry following previous tightening. While China\u2019s economy is still struggling, Tencent\u2019s latest results beat expectations as short-form videos helped drive its online ad business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe games business may see a margin boost after Tencent\u2019s surprise move to pull DnF Mobile from Chinese Android app stores following complaints of high fees. Meanwhile, Huawei Technologies Co. is said to be considering commissions of 20% on its Harmony mobile operating system, much lower than the industry standard.\n\n\u201cThere is a high likelihood that other Android app stores like Oppo and Xiaomi that are charging 50% will lower to 30%,\u201d said Morningstar Inc. senior equity analyst Ivan Su. Consensus seems to have improved on China\u2019s game industry given the strong pipeline and the government\u2019s \u201csofter regulatory approach,\u201d he added.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nNokia Oyj has agreed to acquire Infinera Corp. in a transaction valuing the maker of optical telecommunications equipment at $2.3 billion including debt. Tesla Inc. no longer stands above other electric vehicles in quality because head-scratching design changes on its cars, such as removing turn-signal stalks, have frustrated its owners and lowered its score in a bellwether quality survey.

        "content": "When we think of social media influencers, we think of silly teenagers dancing on ByteDance\u2019s TikTok. However, the industry is becoming significant, and social media is leading to a $1.2 trillion market of e-commerce that leverages attention and influence. To take advantage of this trend, it\u2019s easy to attempt to invest in the most popular tech stocks like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) or Snap (NYSE:SNAP). However, they often have high valuations. If the thesis to invest in them doesn\u2019t work out as expected, investors could be trapped into buying a bubble. But what about undervalued social media stocks?\n\nTo find opportunities, we must go for stocks often overlooked while having strong financials to have what Warren Buffett called a \u201cmargin of safety.\u201d If we buy inherently cheap stocks, the stock price won\u2019t have much room to go down even if it fails to grow as expected. Below are three social media stocks that are potentially undervalued and a way to get into the burgeoning social media market with more upside.\n\nJOYY (YY) hands holding smartphone with social media icons floating above it. brick wall background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJOYY (NASDAQ:YY) is a video-based social media platform based in Singapore. It has a significant presence in Asia and is prominent globally. Though many in the West have not heard about it, BIGO Live, its flagship product, ranks as the world\u2019s second-largest social app based on consumer spending.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirst quarter 2024 revenue declined 3.3% year-over-year (YOY) to $554.6 million, while net profits grew 34.8% to $45.3 million. Its revenue has declined due to the tough ad spend environment and competitive pressures. However, management has shown good discipline in cost-cutting. In addition, the sale of some investments combined with increased interest income contributed to management rewarding shareholders with more earnings.\n\nIts stock is down over 11% this year, while its trailing price-to-earnings ratio is down to just 5.81x as of writing, trading at a historic low.\u00a0 For reference, another social media platform like Snapchat trades over a forward P/E ratio of 84.03x.\u00a0With valuations so low, now is an excellent time to take a second look at this social media giant.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Guiyang, China skyline at Jiaxiu Pavilion on the Nanming River. China Stocks\n\nSource: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a Chinese tech company that started as a social media company but expanded to everything from gaming to cloud computing to fintech. It owns WeChat, the de facto social media app in China, which acts as a super app for everything from paying bills to ordering food. WeChat has 1.2 billion active monthly users and comprises almost the entire population of China.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q1 2024, total revenue was roughly $22.5 billion, up 6% YOY. Meanwhile, net income was $6 billion, up 62% YOY.\n\nBecause China adopted short-form content early, social media penetration has been much stronger there than in other nations. 15% of all retail products in China are already sold exclusively through social channels, triple that of the United States. With such dominant control over social media in China, Tencent is primed to capitalize on the increased use and purchasing of social media.\n\nIts forward P/E ratio is just 15.92x, on the low side for one of the biggest social media companies in the world, but expected due to the negative sentiment surrounding China. Still, Tencent is a healthy social media business that many are overlooking.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on wall of corporate building.\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u00a0 is a multimedia software company that helps people produce images and videos. It was founded in 1982 and currently has over 60% market share.\n\nAdobe is like the shovel to the creator economy. Creators must use its products to create content posted on social media.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Adobe\u2019s revenue was $5.31 billion, up 10% YOY. Its net income was $1.57 billion, up over 20% YOY. Despite its good financial performance, the stock is down almost 10% year-to-date. This is due to worse-than-expected guidance from management and the lack of growth in its AI services that people expected.\n\nIt trades at a forward P/E ratio of 28.9x, which is justified due to the company\u2019s strong growth, though still pricey. Adobe has been underperforming compared to its other tech peers, rising only 77% in the past five years. Adobe\u2019s strong market position and financials make it a good bet on social media stocks, and the pullback in its stock price presents a better opportunity to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Smart Play: 3 Video Game Stocks to Buy on Sale Now",
        "content": "The video game stocks haven\u2019t exactly been on a hot run of late. Undoubtedly, discretionary spending isn\u2019t in the greatest spot these days, with inflation still a huge concern for many. Still, I do see value in some of the sold-off video game plays, even as most others look to dismiss them as dead money.\n\nWhen it comes to video games, there\u2019s big money to be made. But, at the same time, significant capital expenditures with no guarantee of success could make for a rather choppy stock chart. Indeed, that\u2019s the nature of the entertainment content creation business these days.\n\nAs video games become more immersive and realistic, perhaps with more virtual reality (VR) titles eventually paving a path to the metaverse, the gaming plays seem worth checking out while they\u2019re down and out.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this piece, we\u2019ll look at three video game stocks that show lots of promise.\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) Electronic Arts logo on a wall\n\nSource: Rick Neves / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) stock has been in a sideways correction (or period of price consolidation) for a number of years now. Undoubtedly, there\u2019s nothing at all exciting about EA stock while it\u2019s going for $140 and change, perhaps other than the fairly modest price of admission.\n\nThe stock trades at 18.9 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), which is not a high price to pay for a firm with a wealth of top video game franchises. Not to mention EA pretty much has a monopoly in triple-A sports titles. Whether you\u2019re a fan of the NHL, Madden, Soccer (or football as it\u2019s sometimes referred to outside of America), or MLB, odds are you already have an EA Sports title in your library.\n\nUp ahead, EA Sports College Football and Dragon Age: The Veilguard are intriguing releases that could help move the needle. Stifel\u2019s Drew Crum thinks these two titles are less-appreciated catalysts that could propel the stock. I think he\u2019s right; EA stock\u2019s too cheap here.\n\nUbisoft Entertainment (UBSFY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUbisoftEntertainment (OTCMKTS:UBSFY) is a French video-gaming firm that\u2019s worth going over the counter for while it\u2019s trading at multi-year depths. The company is behind a number of franchises, Assassin\u2019s Creed being the most notable among them. Unlike EA stock, which has gone sideways for years, UBSFY shares have been in a horrendous multi-year slide. At writing, the stock is off more than 80% from its July 2018 peak.\n\nDespite a library of strong franchises, Ubisoft has stumbled with some big-budget flops in recent years. Skull & Bones, a title Ubisoft called referred to as \u201cquadruple-A\u201c, was a notable underperformer that shows incredibly ambitious projects are no guarantee of solid returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Assassin\u2019s Creed: Shadows launching later this year, perhaps Ubisoft has what it takes to catch a bid higher. The franchise has quite the following and may just help the dirt-cheap stock reverse course.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a Chinese internet giant that looks like the best value in video gaming right now. At writing, TCEHY stock is still down over 50% from its February 2021 highs. The firm behind the popular Chinese super-app WeChat may not be a video game pure-play, but it punches well above its weight class, backing numerous firms behind some of the world\u2019s most popular games.\n\nThe company owns a majority holding in Clash of Clans maker Supercell, a partial holding in Fortnite maker Epic Games, all of Riot Games, the firm behind League of Legends, and stakes in many other gaming studios. These are profoundly successful titles that remain popular many years after their initial release.\n\nWith a library of stellar video game investments, Tencent could be the firm to own if you want exposure to live service games that can act as major cash cows for years, even decades, following launch. With Supercell launching its first new game, Squad Busters, in five years, questions linger as to whether it will have staying power as the hit sensation that was Clash of Clans.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Since Tuesday, at least a half-dozen companies and startups including Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Zhipu AI began offering incentives to developers making the switch.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s shift will accentuate the divide between China and the US, which is trying to curb Beijing\u2019s AI and chip efforts. While the startup\u2019s exit offers an opportunity for sector leaders to grow their user base, it also deprives entrepreneurs and cash-strapped startups of some of the best tools available to fine-tune or get their AI applications off the ground.\n\nFor China, that could help usher out many smaller startups created during the \u201cbattle of a hundred models,\u201d in the wake of ChatGPT\u2019s late 2022 debut. And a bigger concern may be whether open-source models like Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s Llama also cut off access, said Bernard Leong, chief executive officer of Singapore-based Dorje AI.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be a bloodbath of the large language models and I suspect that there\u2019s probably going to be very few players left,\u201d said Leong, who\u2019s also founder of the tech podcast Analyse Asia. \u201cThere will be very few winners, and those will be the biggest in China.\u201d\n\nChinese artificial intelligence-related stocks, including Alibaba and Iflytek Co., rose on Wednesday.\n\nThe major firms were quick to sense the opportunity.\n\nFor users migrating from OpenAI, Baidu promised free AI model fine-tuning and expert guidance on its flagship Ernie model, along with 50 million free tokens that developers can use to query the bot. Alibaba and Tencent posted ads encouraging the shift. Tech pioneer Kai-fu Lee\u2019s 01.AI touted heavy discounts.\n\nBaichuan, which is backed by both Alibaba and Tencent, offered 10 million free tokens. SenseTime Group Inc. dangled 50 million. Zhipu put forth 150 million tokens and a series of training sessions to ease the transition. Even Microsoft Corp. \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s biggest backer \u2014 published a step-by-step guide on WeChat on how to migrate to its local service, operated by local partner 21Vianet.\n\nStory continues\n\nUS firms such as OpenAI, Meta and Alphabet Inc. have led the world in generative AI, which spits out text, images and video from simple commands. Underpinning those models are application programming interfaces that developers use to build up and refine their own platforms to integrate services either with the likes of ChatGPT, or their own proprietary models.\n\nThat was a boon to Chinese developers starting from scratch, who accessed OpenAI\u2019s tools through virtual private networks or other ways around the country\u2019s Great Firewall. Many local developers \u2014 particularly those without deep pockets \u2014 favored training AI systems and applications via OpenAI\u2019s tools, because they were regarded as industry benchmarks.\n\nOpenAI is now threatening to sever the connection.\n\n\u201cLeading Chinese large language models can benefit from the restricted access to OpenAI, and it will help to filter out smaller, less effective players from the market,\u201d said You Chuanman, head of the Chinese University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen\u2019s IIA Centre for Regulation and Global Governance. \u201cAt the same time, it will make it harder for Chinese developers to use the most advanced global AI algorithms.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\u2019s move coincides with rising pressure from Washington to curb Chinese access to the most advanced artificial intelligence and semiconductor technology. The US Treasury Department advanced plans over the weekend to further restrict investments by US individuals and companies into China, with a focus on curtailing next-generation technologies.\n\nIn the long run, industry experts say a lack of access to global tools may further impede Chinese AI players in general as they play catch-up to the US. Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai has said it would take at least two years for homegrown AI models to match US ones.\n\nIt could also accelerate a migration overseas by Chinese tech startups seeking faster-growing markets with less political uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThis situation is directly related to the ongoing competition between China and the US in frontier technologies,\u201d said Neil Zhu Xiaohu, the founder and chief scientist of University AI, which trains Chinese companies.\n\n\u201cWe had US laws targeting Chinese semiconductors previously and more recently, there are semiconductor and AI work restrictions, so the restriction of China\u2019s API services is not something that happened out of the blue.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Saritha Rai, Zheping Huang and Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Why BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford Corporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash Musk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History Independence Without Accountability: The Fed\u2019s Great Inflation Fail\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Its China launch was delayed due to Beijing's temporary freeze on new game approvals.\n\nDnF Mobile's early success comes amid ongoing tensions between Tencent and smartphone vendors over gaming revenue sharing.\n\nEarlier this month, Tencent pulled the game from selected Android app stores, citing contract expiries.\n\nGame developers in China have long had a contentious relationship with distributors over issues such as revenue sharing, as mobile games become increasingly popular in the broader game market. The standard 50% revenue split has often been a bone of contention.\n\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Casey Hall; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Lincoln Feast.)",

        "content": "DnF Mobile raked in US$270 million from Apple's China iOS platform since its launch on May 21, according to data provided by app intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\n\"Since its release, DnF Mobile has been occupying the top positions for the iOS charts in all categories. This is a very impressive start, and it has been stable as well,\" Nan Lu, Sensor Tower's senior director of Asia-Pacific marketing, said on Tuesday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"The future performance will depend on Tencent's operations and continuous updates to the game,\" Lu added.\n\nThe title crossed the US$100 million mark just 10 days after its launch, topping the revenue growth chart, and its 11-day sales run in May surpassed the combined revenues of Tencent's long-time blockbusters Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite over the same period, Sensor Tower data showed.\n\nThe strong performance of DnF Mobile, described as the \"most explosive\" debut for a mobile title in the past few years, contributed to a 12 per cent rise in Tencent's mobile gaming revenue last month, according to Sensor Tower.\n\nIn this photo illustration, the Tencent logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. Photo: Shutterstock Images alt=In this photo illustration, the Tencent logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. Photo: Shutterstock Images>\n\nThe performance exceeded expectations and will give a much-needed boost to Tencent's video gaming business on the mainland, which recorded a 2 per cent year-on-year decline in first-quarter revenue to 34.5 billion yuan (US$4.8 billion).\n\nThe new title is the mobile version of Dungeon & Fighter Online, the personal computer (PC) game developed by Neople, the subsidiary of South Korean studio Nexon. It garnered attention from Chinese gamers who were fans of the multiplayer \"beat 'em up\", action role-playing PC game that initially debuted in mainland China in 2008.\n\n\"Nostalgia has played a significant role in the success of DnF Mobile, as it taps into the fond memories of Chinese millennials who grew up playing the original DnF game,\" said Ivan Su, senior analyst at Morningstar. \"These once cash-strapped students now possess more disposable income, which they're willing to spend on this familiar mobile adaptation.\"\n\nThe original PC game and its solid gamer base will also help to keep the mobile title's growth momentum going for longer, before the inevitable decline over time, Su added.\n\nStory continues\n\nA screenshot from Tencent's Dungeon and Fighter Mobile game. Photo: Handout alt=A screenshot from Tencent's Dungeon and Fighter Mobile game. Photo: Handout>\n\n\"Since DnF Mobile can leverage a substantial amount of content already used in its Korean version, we expect the decrease in revenue to be gradual, helping to maintain player interest and prolong popularity,\" Su said.\n\nTencent, which runs the world's biggest video gaming business by revenue, last week pulled the game from Android app stores run by Chinese smartphone makers including Huawei Technologies, Oppo and Vivo.\n\nIt marked the latest flare-up between game developers and platforms on sales sharing, as Android app store operators on the mainland are known for sometimes taking up to 50 per cent of a video game's revenue as commission.\n\nEnding cooperation with these Android platforms will not affect the game or Tencent's revenues, as the Chinese internet giant also runs its own app store and makes the title downloadable through an official website, analysts said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

ByteDance declined to comment on revenue-sharing talks with Huawei.\n\nThe latest initiatives by Huawei show how it is trying to buttress HarmonyOS' position as the second-biggest mobile operating system in mainland China, after overtaking Apple's iOS in the first quarter.\n\nWeChat - marketed as Weixin on the mainland - has 1.36 billion monthly active users nationwide, while top short video platform Douyin has more than 600 million daily active users.\n\n\"Bloomberg's recent report on Huawei's talks with Tencent to establish a lower-than-industry share of 20 per cent for in-game purchases provides hope for a reset\" of the 30 per cent take-rate standard of app stores over the past decade, Morningstar senior equity analyst Ivan Su wrote in a research note on Wednesday.\n\n\"Although Huawei's HarmonyOS currently represents a small percentage of smartphones in China, the potential lowering of its app store fee to 20 per cent could pressure other mobile app platforms to follow suit.\"\n\nWhile revenue-sharing talks are still undetermined, providing favourable terms to app developers could help HarmonyOS stay ahead of iOS on the mainland.\n\nPeople walk past a shop of Huawei Technologies in Shanghai's Huangpu district on June 5, 2024.

The privately held company is expected to reach a new milestone this year when it releases HarmonyOS Next, which will not support Android-based apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuawei plans to release HarmonyOS Next with the Mate 70 series flagship smartphones later this year, rotating chairman Eric Xu Zhijun said in May.\n\nThe build-up of the HarmonyOS app ecosystem is \"a crucial task for Huawei in 2024\", Xu said in April. He added that 5,000 apps are expected to support HarmonyOS this year, with plans to grow that number to 1 million over time.\n\nBoth Tencent and ByteDance are among the major Chinese firms that have been working to make their apps compatible with HarmonyOS. These include Tencent's QQ Music and ByteDance's Qimao Novels.\n\nOther large enterprises that have started development of HarmonyOS-based apps include Alibaba Group Holding, Meituan, Ant Group, JD.com and McDonald's China. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "By Liam Mo and Casey Hall\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Tencent is removing from Thursday its hit mobile game \"Dungeon & Fighter\" (DnF Mobile) from selected Android app stores as its contracts have expired, the company said.\n\nGame developers in China have long had a contentious relationship with distributors over issues such as revenue sharing, as mobile games become increasingly popular in the broader game market.\n\nIn the case of partnerships between developers and Android app stores, the standard 50% revenue share split has often been a bone of contention.\n\nTencent, China's largest game developer by revenue, did not specify which app stores would be affected. Local media outlet 21st Century Business Herald reported that the affected app stores include those of Huawei, Oppo and Vivo.\n\nTencent had a similar dispute in 2021 when Huawei removed several of its mobile games from the smartphone maker's app store due to a dispute over revenue sharing.\n\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Casey Hall; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Miral Fahmy)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese tech shares are benefiting from signs of an improving economy, and will stage another rally when they deliver better earnings, according to an analyst who once questioned the sector\u2019s investability.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCar Dealerships Across US Halt Services After Cyberattack What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Nvidia\u2019s 591,078% Rally to Most Valuable Stock Came in Waves \u2018I Live in Hell\u2019: Anti-Growth Fervor Grips US South After Pandemic Boom Hedge Fund Talent Schools Are Looking for the Perfect Trader\n\nThe stocks are taking a breather after advancing earlier this year, but there\u2019s room for 20% to 25% more upside as fundamentals such as cost and competition improve, said Alex Yao, co-head of Asia TMT research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Yao called a bottom for the sector in an April report.\n\n\u201cIf the sector is able to grow their earnings at, let\u2019s say, teens or even twenties, over the long run, I think people should reward those corporates for the earnings sustainability,\u201d Yao said in an interview last week.\n\nTech bellwethers like Tencent Holdings Ltd. have led a rebound in Chinese stocks as Beijing pivoted from a wide regulatory crackdown to focus on policies to bolster the economy. While that has led global funds to lift their weightings, the stocks have given up some gains in the past month as investors want to see improved earnings and more policy support before committing further.\n\nThe Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks key Chinese tech stocks, rose by 38% from a January low to peak in May. It has since fallen about 8%.\n\n\u201cThe top-down view is that if macro recovers, then the e-commerce names will benefit from the cyclical recovery of consumption,\u201d Yao said. \u201cThis time the theme is China macro stabilization.\u201d\n\nMacro Indicators\n\nInvestors have been closely watching data coming out of China \u2014 including consumption growth, inflation and developments in the property market \u2014 for clues on the strength of its economic recovery. \u201cMacro indicators which are showing early indication of a stabilization\u201d have been the main driver of the sector\u2019s rally year to date, and will be a key factor for future share price trends, he said.\n\nChina\u2019s growth remains highly uneven. The country\u2019s housing slump deepened in May and industrial output fell short of forecasts. Still, improving consumption and strong exports offer some encouragement for traders.\n\nYao surprised the market two years ago when he downgraded 28 firms, including Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., saying the sector was not investable amid geopolitical and regulatory risks. While he lifted ratings on some of the stocks just two months later, the term \u201cuninvestable\u201d has since become a closely associated catchphrase.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst now has overweight ratings on stocks including Tencent, Alibaba and Meituan.\n\nTo be sure, any rebound in tech shares may be volatile given that sentiment in Chinese stocks remain weak. Investors are also worried about the potential impact of geopolitical risks and a burgeoning price war in China\u2019s nascent artificial intelligence market.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most important is for the sector to show consistent and healthy earnings growth,\u201d Yao said. \u201cAnd if you can deliver that from a fundamental perspective, it\u2019s still a very attractive sector.\u201d\n\n(Updates with Hang Seng Tech Index\u2019s performance in fifth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds Documents Show How Musk\u2019s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo Coke\u2014and Dozens of Others\u2014Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. is nearing a deal to let Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s WeChat super app operate fully on its Harmony mobile platform without sharing any revenue, a concession designed to defend its newfound lead over Apple Inc. in China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\n\u2018I Live in Hell\u2019: Anti-Growth Fervor Grips US South After Pandemic Boom What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Nvidia\u2019s 591,078% Rally to Most Valuable Stock Came in Waves Nvidia Becomes World\u2019s Most Valuable Company as AI Rally Steams Ahead I Didn\u2019t Think Biden Affected Crime Rates. I Was Wrong.\n\nThe deal, in which Huawei will agree not to charge Tencent any fee for in-app transactions within the WeChat universe, comes after months-long negotiations between the two Shenzhen-based tech behemoths, according to people with knowledge of the matter. They declined to be named discussing private corporate information.\n\nThe arrangement will likely make WeChat a rare exception in Huawei\u2019s plan to start charging a fee for content and services on its app store. Huawei is considering taking a cut of in-app purchases on its Harmony platform, and it has been discussing a fee of about 20% with game developers, Bloomberg News reported earlier this week.\n\nIn return, Tencent will maintain and update the WeChat app that hundreds of millions of Chinese rely on daily for everything from payment to gaming, the people said.\n\nThe agreement, once sealed, would also be a boon for Tencent as it looks to drive more sales from WeChat\u2019s mini programs, its platform for lite-versions of popular apps such as Didi. Tencent generated 1.5 trillion yuan ($207 billion) in gross merchandise value from its mini programs in the September quarter last year.\n\nCurrently users can download and use WeChat on Huawei handsets, but the two companies do not have a formal arrangement that obligates Tencent to provide regular updates to the app. The deal, which will not create a perceivable change for phone owners, also requires Huawei to continue to host and support WeChat.\n\nThe talks are ongoing and the two sides could still fail to agree on a deal, the people said. Huawei shifted to its in-house Harmony OS after US sanctions cut it off from working with Google, the proprietor of Android.\n\nStriking a deal is particularly crucial for Huawei because the company is moving to a new version of Harmony that may lose access to WeChat if Tencent didn\u2019t continue to support the app. The agreement helps ensure that WeChat will be ready when Huawei makes its transition.\n\nHuawei has also reached out to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s Douyin in an attempt to discuss revenue sharing, but the Beijing-based social media company has not expressed any interest in opening talks, said one of the people.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuawei, Tencent and ByteDance did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nHuawei\u2019s negotiation with Tencent emerged from a broader effort to begin monetizing its smartphone platform, which just overtook Apple\u2019s iOS in terms of market share in China. Apple also doesn\u2019t take a cut of WeChat transactions but it does levy a 30% commission on purchases of WeChat Beans, a virtual currency users can spend on various in-app features such as tipping a livestreamer, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. Apple did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\n--With assistance from Zheping Huang, Jessica Sui and Vlad Savov.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCoke\u2014and Dozens of Others\u2014Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "HONG KONG, June 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Tencent is participating in the validation of cross-border-payments use cases for Project mBridge at the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage. The goal is to facilitate further enhancement to the quality of cross-border clearing and settlement services.\n\nWith its fintech capabilities and cross-border use cases, while building upon the efficient and cost-effective feature of mBridge, Tencent continues to deepen its exploration and application of this technology. Tencent's e-CNY project team, jointly operated by Tenpay, Tencent's domestic payment platform, and WeBank, is among the first batch of e-CNY operating organizations. Since September 2023, the team has been actively participating in Project mBridge.\n\nThe mBridge project team, which consists of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre, the Bank of Thailand, the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), announced earlier that Project mBridge has reached the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage.\n\nProject mBridge aims to create a cross-border payment solution that focuses on central bank digital currencies, emphasizing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and regulatory compliance. By encompassing various legal jurisdictions and currencies, mBridge seeks to explore the application of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and central bank digital currencies in cross-border payments, to achieve faster, cheaper, and more secure cross-border payment and settlement processes.\n\n\"As Tencent's cross-border payment platform, Tenpay Global provides a validation use case based on cross-border e-commerce export trade payment collection for Tencent's participation in Project mBridge at the MVP stage. This facilitated Tencent's successful completion of cross-border fund settlements at various nodes of the mBridge, showcasing significant advantages in both the efficiency and cost\u2011effectiveness of cross-border payments,\" said Royal Chen, Vice President of Tencent Financial Technology.\n\n\"Driven by financial technology capabilities and user needs, Tenpay Global will continue to diversify business use cases to facilitate Tencent's participation in Project mBridge. Capitalizing on the highly efficient and cost-effective features of mBridge, this approach aims to further explore the practical implementations of mBridge to address the pain points of cross-border payments,\" he added.\n\nStory continues Cision\n\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/apac/news-releases/tencent-engages-in-the-validation-of-cross-border-payments-use-cases-as-project-mbridge-reaches-the-minimum-viable-product-stage-302175267.html\n\nSOURCE Tencent\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Cheap Tech Stocks That Could Be the Next Big Thing",
        "content": "Many successful tech stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple are priced in line with each company\u2019s substantial market shares and cash flows. So, some investors who want to get in on the hot tech sector, can\u2019t do so financially. However, a select few stocks within tech don\u2019t yet have the recognition as the top dogs but are on their way to similar success.\n\nThese three climbing tech stocks are positioned to spring upward within the tech sector. Each has its unique trait and service that caters to a broad audience and a current demand within tech that has brought them great success. The best part? They are miles cheaper than the more popular tech stocks.\n\nWe\u2019ll detail the nuances that make these stocks so exciting for investors who are looking to share the soaring profits of tech but don\u2019t want to break the bank doing so.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTencent (TCEHY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencent (OTC:TCEHY) is a Chinese tech giant with a presence in almost every sector of the infinitely broad sector. Those include video games, fintech, cloud computing, digital advertising and music subscription services.\n\nChina\u2019s macroeconomic conditions haven\u2019t been the best since last year, resulting from strict regulations and less consumer spending. Tencent was undoubtedly affected by the headwinds. But, it has managed to find success even in the roughest of conditions.\n\nThe company beat estimates for EPS and revenue in the most recent quarter, reporting a 23% increase in gross profit and a 6% in revenue year-over-year (YOY). The net margin for the period increased by 10% compared to last year. And profit attributable to equity holders is up 54% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nFurther, Tencent pulled off such an impressive quarter through the diverse success of its vast segments. Truly, games are Tencent\u2019s main cash cow. But this quarter demonstrated the impact of diverse revenue streams.\n\nProfits surged YOY, as music subscriptions increased 20%, video subscriptions increased 8%. User time on video accounts increased 80% (digital advertising revenue from the platform), and the company reported many upgrades in all categories.\n\nTencent is slowly overcoming the headwinds it faces operating out of China but has proven its ability to succeed and show excellent potential. The best part is that the stock is still wildly cheap, considering its recent growth. Therefore, there is no better time for investors to tune in while it rides this momentum.\n\nWalmart (WMT) The blue, white, and yellow Walmart (WMT) logo is being displayed on a small rectangle sign in the grass.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is not what investors typically consider a tech stock. Yet, the retail mega-giant has staked its claim within some of the biggest tech categories. Walmart is seeing wild success in digital advertising and its e-commerce segment, which has had a positive effect on its top line.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe retail superstar smashed estimates in Q1, reporting 6% revenue growth and adjusted operating income growth of 13.7% YOY. This impressive growth included a 21% increase in global e-commerce sales and a 24% growth in global advertising.\n\nWhile brick-and-mortar retail will always be Walmart\u2019s top seller, the growth in Walmart\u2019s tech segments is undeniable. Although Walmart is not a typical tech stock, investors would still be investing and profiting from the tech sector\u2019s overall growth and benefiting from the stability and success the company\u2019s retail segment brings.\n\nWalmart is on its way to immense success among the greats of e-commerce and other tech giants. And the best part about this stock is its phenomenally low price. There are a few reasons to pass this opportunity up, and growth in tech will only carry Walmart higher.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has established itself as a top dog within processing but lost out big time in semiconductor chips to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor and ON Semiconductor. However, following the reinstatement of Pat Gelsinger as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Intel has committed time and money to build the foundation for a ferocious comeback. And that comeback starts now.\n\nIntel had a lot of ground to cover to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor. But it was able to secure investments from various sources. That includes an $11 billion equity acquisition from private equity firm Apollo to fund its huge gamble on revamping its chip manufacturing.\n\nThe massive investments the company received don\u2019t stop there. Also, Intel received a whopping $8.5 billion from the Biden administration to further improve existing manufacturing plants and build new ones across the U.S., including Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon locations.\n\nThe surge of AI applications within tech means that semiconductor chips are in demand more than ever. So, Intel plans to be at the top of the supply chain. It also has high hopes for its GPU accelerator business, and at its current price, investors shouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy shares before the price explodes.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings plans to ban digital hosts powered by artificial intelligence (AI) on its live-streaming commerce platforms, as Beijing tightens controls over AI-generated content.\n\nWeixin Channel, WeChat's video platform, has published a draft of new rules covering \"low-quality content\", which noted that the use of \"plug-ins, AI and other tools to generate avatars for live streaming\" was not allowed.\n\n\"Teaching and selling virtual human software\" will also be regarded as \"confrontational behaviour\" and prohibited, according to the draft.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe new draft rules come as authorities have cracked down on the use of AI technologies for creating virtual avatars. Internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), has requested that local providers of generative AI services must take measures to prevent the dissemination of discriminatory content and false information, according to CAC's proposed regulation published last April.\n\nTencent said online hosts who violate the rules will have their live-streaming exposure reduced by the company's algorithm, and more serious violators will have their e-commerce function limited.\n\nTencent's motive for changing the rules was to \"encourage more [live] anchors to have real-time interaction with viewers\", according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe draft rules are open for comments from June 7-13, and Tencent will review feedback from live streamers, according to the people.\n\nLi Chengdong, founder of Beijing-based consultancy Dolphin, said the changes were designed to protect the interests of the platform. \"Since the cost of creating avatars is super low, one individual can create hundreds or even thousands of avatars in a short period of time, which could impact real-life anchors and disrupt the market,\" Li told the Post.\n\nDespite the growing scrutiny of \"virtual humans\", China's top live streaming platforms continue to allow AI-powered avatars. The market was worth 20.52 billion yuan (US$2.8 billion) last year, and is forecast to more than double to 48.06 billion yuan in 2025, according to iiMedia Research.\n\nChinese e-commerce giant JD.com has embraced the concept. In April, the avatar of its founder and chairman Richard Liu Qiangdong debuted on its platform. Liu's avatar hosted two live-streaming sessions to promote consumer electronic devices and groceries, attracting more than 20 million views combined.\n\nStory continues\n\nA smartphone with the WeChat logo is seen in front of the flag of the People's Republic of China. Photo: Shutterstock Images alt=A smartphone with the WeChat logo is seen in front of the flag of the People's Republic of China. Photo: Shutterstock Images>\n\nJD.com rival Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the Post, does not prohibit the use of or promotion of avatars on its live-streaming platforms. On Taobao's online shopping channel, there are hundreds of vendors providing digital human-related services, including creating clones for clients and providing courses for building digital hosts. These services are priced from 20 yuan to 8,000 yuan.\n\nAlibaba Cloud has also promoted its digital human services, saying they can serve as live-streaming hosts and shopping assistants to provide round-the-clock services, at a cost of 5,749 yuan a month for each 3D avatar, according to its website.\n\nAlthough Douyin, the Chinese version of ByteDance's global hit short video app TikTok, has not banned virtual humans in live streaming, it rolled out a set of rules last May asking digital creators to label any content generated by AI, in compliance with China's new regulations on \"deep fake\" technologies.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "A loss-making firm that applies artificial intelligence (AI) to drug research has become a new darling for both old-money and new-money investors in Hong Kong, drawn by the impressive credentials of its three founders, who trained at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), as well as the endorsement of Tencent Holdings' billionaire founder Pony Ma Huateng.\n\nNine-year-old QuantumPharm, which began trading on Thursday, raised nearly HK$1 billion (US$128 million) in an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong, becoming the first technology company to float shares under the city's relaxed regulatory framework known as Chapter 18C.\n\nThe Hong Kong stock exchange introduced Chapter 18C a year ago to allow promising start-ups worth at least HK$10 billion to sell shares even before they have made any revenue, as part of the government's efforts to transform the city into a hi-tech hub.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe IPO of Quantum Pharm, known also as XtalPi, has been portrayed as a showcase of Hong Kong's major role in supporting China's \"hard technology\" drive.\n\nHong Kong finance chief Paul Chan Mo-po delivered a congratulatory message on the day of the firm's trading debut, saying that the city's advantage as an international financial centre enables it to facilitate technological innovation, a key element in the \"new quality productive forces\" that President Xi Jinping sees as key to China's development.\n\nQuantumPharm's cornerstone investors include real estate mogul Peter Lee Ka-kit, chairman of Henderson Land Group, as well as MIT chemistry professor Bradley Pentelute, according to the underwriters.\n\nPublic investors oversubscribed the offer by 103 times.\n\nSome subscribers were likely dazzled by QuantumPharm's three founding members - Wen Shuhao, Ma Jian and Lai Lipeng - who are all scientists trained at one of the world's most highly regarded research universities.\n\n\"Ten years ago, we were three young men at MIT,\" said Wen, the company's chairman, at the company's listing ceremony on Thursday. The company now brings together \"hundreds of PhD degree holders\" after \"a decade of hard work\", he said.\n\nWen, 42, earned his doctorate in physical chemistry from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2010 and went on to work as a postdoctoral associate at MIT from 2013 to 2015.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere, he met future business partners Ma, a quantum computing scientist and now CEO at QuantumPharm, and Lai, who holds a PhD in Physics from Chicago University.\n\nBy combining their expertise, the Shenzhen-based company is trying to use quantum physics, artificial intelligence and robotics to significantly shorten the time needed to develop and test new medicine. One of QuantumPharm's claimed achievements is that its technology helped reduce the development cycle of Pfizer's Paxlovid, the first Covid-19 oral treatment, to six weeks.\n\nPony Ma Huateng, founder of Tencent. Photo: STR/AFP alt=Pony Ma Huateng, founder of Tencent. Photo: STR/AFP>\n\nQuantumPharm's pitch was impressive enough to win the attention of Tencent's Ma, whom Wen said he met in 2016. While Ma said at the time that the social media and video gaming giant, also based in Shenzhen, seldom invested in pharmaceutical ventures, he decided to bet on the start-up because of its potential \"social value\".\n\nTencent, China's highest-valued tech giant and a key investor in QuantumPharm, has put about US$1 billion into the company as of June 2023, according to the start-up's prospectus. Tencent holds 13 per cent of QuantumPharm's shares after the IPO.\n\n\"The company that creates the greatest social value can create the greatest business value,\" Wen said.\n\nBut for now, QuantumPharm still needs to prove its commercial value.\n\nThe company's losses widened 19 per cent to 522 million yuan (US$72 million) last year, dwarfing its revenue of 174 million yuan, mostly due to its heavy research expenditure.\n\nShares of the company closed at HK$5.4 on Friday, down 6.9 per cent and wiping out most of its gains since Thursday amid a broader slip in the Hong Kong market.\n\nQuantumPharm has \"generated initial excitement and optimism among investors\" in Hong Kong, but it has to prove to investors that it can make profits, said Dickie Wong, executive director at local brokerage Kingston Securities.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding, the e-commerce giant that is investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence (AI), has updated its open-source AI models with claims of besting Meta Platforms' Llama 3 model in certain tasks.\n\nAlibaba Cloud on Friday launched Qwen2 - the second iteration of its open-source Tongyi Qianwen family of large language models (LLM), the technology behind chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT - with a series of updates including multilingual pre-training and an expanded the context window. That means it now allows for much longer queries and answers, putting in it the league of the world's most powerful open source LLMs.\n\nQwen2 comes in five variations. The high-end Qwen2-72B model consistently offered better results than Meta's Llama 3-70B - the strongest open-source AI model from the Facebook owner - in various benchmark tests, according to Alibaba. Tests include maths, coding, natural and social sciences, engineering and the humanities, the company said in a post published to the model's official GitHub page.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAlibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, has launched Qwen2 just one month after unveiling Tongyi Qianwen 2.5, which is closed source. The company said at the time that model performs better in various Chinese capabilities than GPT-4, OpenAI's most advanced model, which is also closed source.\n\nThe five variations of Alibaba's Qwen2, from the more nimble Qwen2-0.5B to its most sophisticated Qwen2-72B, have between 490 million and 72.7 billion parameters. They are also trained on 27 languages, in addition to Chinese and English: nine from Europe, four from the Middle East, and 14 from Asia.\n\nThe rapid follow-up launch of a new AI model, with capabilities matching leading global models, reflects the confidence that the Chinese firm has in funnelling an increasing amount of resources into an AI race that has engulfed much of the tech industry.\n\nMany other Chinese companies, from the biggest tech giants to myriad start-ups, have been forging ahead in their own LLM development efforts, recently igniting a domestic price war.\n\nShenzhen-based social media and video gaming giant Tencent Holdings announced its own dedicated chatbot in late May called Yuanbao, backed by the company's latest Hunyuan LLM. Tencent said its home-grown model has gone through a series of enhancements since its launch last September.\n\nStory continues\n\nHunyuan has been baked into more than 600 business scenarios across Tencent's organisations, as it aims to use AI to help boost efficiency. Alibaba is also looking to leverage AI to help transform businesses.\n\nAlibaba.com, the e-commerce giant's business-to-business cross-border sourcing platform, has recently introduced its own AI-powered tools to help connect sellers and buyers to boost sales, Zhang Kuo, the platform's president, told the Post in a recent interview.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Tencent Holdings' ubiquitous super app, WeChat, is now requiring all creators on the platform to disclose whether a published post was generated using artificial intelligence (AI) technology, months after China's internet regulator cracked down on such \"unlabelled and likely misleading\" content.\n\n\"If the content is AI-generated, it must be labelled,\" WeChat said on Wednesday via its content-security account, Shanhu - the Chinese word for \"coral\".\n\nThe super app, marketed as Weixin on the mainland, will help identify AI-generated content (AIGC) on the platform by displaying the relevant tag at the bottom of a published post.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nWeChat users are also required to describe whether any posted content is a work of fiction, and disclose sources - including authoritative media or professional entities - when the information is related to \"domestic and international current affairs, public policies and social events\". The platform said it disapproves of all unethical practices to generate online traffic.\n\nWeChat, marketed as Weixin on the mainland, helps identify artificial intelligence-generated content on the platform by displaying the relevant tag at the bottom of a published post. Photo: Shutterstock alt=WeChat, marketed as Weixin on the mainland, helps identify artificial intelligence-generated content on the platform by displaying the relevant tag at the bottom of a published post. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nThe updated content-moderation policy of WeChat forms part of a broader industry effort to promote greater AIGC transparency, while protecting internet users from online abuse, scams and misinformation.\n\nMajor domestic and international social media operations - including Bilibili, ByteDance-owned Douyin and TikTok, Google's YouTube and Facebook owner Meta Platforms - have implemented similar measures on AIGC.\n\nGlobal hit short video platform TikTok last month automated the labelling of AIGC posts under a partnership with the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity and the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative. That comes a year after Chinese sibling Douyin introduced tools for watermarking AIGC. TikTok followed suit with the roll-out of AIGC-disclosure labels in September 2023.\n\nAlso last month, Chinese authorities launched an action plan on establishing AI standards. Work on \"general, foundational, ethical, security and privacy standards\" in large language models and generative AI will be intensified, according to a document released by the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, along with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and State Administration for Market Regulation.\n\nStory continues\n\nTencent Holdings last month reported that the combined monthly active users of WeChat and Weixin reached about 1.4 billion in the March quarter. Photo: Shutterstock alt=Tencent Holdings last month reported that the combined monthly active users of WeChat and Weixin reached about 1.4 billion in the March quarter. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nIn March, the Cyberspace Administration of China promised to clean up \"unlabelled and likely misleading\" AIGC in its latest campaign. The regulator demanded that online platforms remove accounts \"that use computer-generated technology for spreading rumours, marketing or hype\".\n\nChinese authorities in May 2023 released the \"Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services\". These measures encourage the application of generative AI across various industries, while safeguarding against illegal and non-compliant activities.\n\nWeChat's AIGC-moderation policy also comes at a time when it has boosted the promotion of Channels, the app's short-video and live-streaming feature. Channels directly competes against the services of Douyin and Kuaishou Technology.\n\nTencent last month reported a more than 80 per cent year-on-year increase in total user time spent on Channels in the first quarter. Channels has become a major driver of Tencent's advertising business.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Nintendo's Pokemon and Riot Games have titles approved for sale in China",
        "content": "The mobile version of Valorant, a popular first-person shooter from Riot, which is based in the US but owned by Tencent Holdings, is among the titles approved on Wednesday by the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), the agency in charge of licensing video games in China.\n\nUnder Chinese regulations, an overseas video game cannot be monetised in the country without a government permit. Getting approval often involves localisation with censorship of sensitive content and it must be operated through a Chinese partner - often Tencent and NetEase, the country's two largest video gaming companies.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nValorant's arrival on smartphones in China has been highly anticipated since the PC version found great commercial success on the mainland, where it launched last July. That was three years after its global release.\n\nTencent touted the title as its \"most important game published in 2023\". The tech giant credited Valorant as a major contributor to its first-quarter domestic game sales this year.\n\nThe regulator also approved three titles for the Nintendo Switch, including the role-playing game Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and platform adventure game Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury. Tencent is the official distributor of the Switch in mainland China.\n\nThe Pokemon game was released globally together with the related title Pokemon: Let's Go, Eevee! in November 2018. Eevee was approved for sale in China in April.\n\nAnother approved title is Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage, a Japanese rhythm game developed by Colorful Palette and published by Sega in 2020. The mobile game, based on the Japanese virtual pop star Hatsune Miku, will be operated in China by Nuverse, the video gaming unit of TikTok owner ByteDance.\n\nThe approval comes days after the Chinese social media giant clarified the strategy for its video gaming business going forward, following an earlier retreat in the market marked by hundreds of lay-offs and shutting down or selling off parts of its business.\n\nNuverse said it is entering a stage that requires patience and \"longtermism\", as it now refocuses on creating \"fun games\". ByteDance appointed a new head of the unit after the company started internal restructuring of its video gaming business last November.\n\nThe NPPA has approved 61 foreign games for sale in China so far this year, which includes two previous batches of approvals in February and April. That is about two-thirds of the 98 such licences approved in all of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe domestic gaming market is seeing competition heat up over the summer holiday as several new titles such as Tencent's DnF Mobile and miHoYo's Zenless Zone Zero try to attract players to their platforms.\n\nChina's video gaming market saw total sales grow 7.6 per cent year on year to 72.6 billion yuan (US$10 million) in the first quarter, according to data released by market research institute CNG.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Tencent-backed artificial intelligence (AI) drug researcher QuantumPharm is raising up to HK$1.13 billion (US$144.5 million) in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) from Tuesday, eyeing the first listing under a new regime for pre-revenue specialist technology firms that was introduced more than a year ago.\n\nThe Shenzhen-headquartered company, also known as XtalPi, is offering 187.37 million shares at HK$5.03 to HK$6.03 each. The shares will start trading on June 13.\n\nQuantumPharm is one of only two firms that have applied to list under the Hong Kong stock exchange's Chapter 18C rule since bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing introduced it in March 2023 to entice technology start-ups to raise capital. Black Sesame International Holding, which makes chips for autonomous driving, is the other candidate.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nWen Shu-hao, QuantumPharm's chairman, said at a media briefing on Monday that the firm is \"very fortunate\" to potentially become the first company under Chapter 18C.\n\n\"We hope that our successful listing will attract more outstanding and top global technology companies to list under 18C,\" Wen said, adding that the firm also hopes to help develop Hong Kong's scientific sector and talent.\n\nChapter 18C allows companies with at least HK$10 billion in valuation to sell shares in IPOs, even if they have yet to earn a single dollar in sales. The threshold will be reduced to HK$6 billion if they have at least HK$250 million in sales in the financial year before their IPOs.\n\nThe exchange's rules, among the most stringent in the world, require at least HK$80 million in combined profit in the three years preceding a new listing. Companies qualified under Chapter 18 will be exempt.\n\n\"It is strategically important to have the first Chapter 18C successful listing to demonstrate the feasibility and market confidence in this new regime, together with regulators' vetting processes to attract more issuers to explore this listing method,\" said Frank Bi, Asia head of corporate transactions at law firm Ashurst.\n\nThe lukewarm response to the new regime up to now has to do with Hong Kong's overall weak capital market, according to Kenny Ng, a securities strategist at China Everbright Securities International.\n\n\"Now the market is slowly picking up, and the mainland's national policies have been supporting the development of Hong Kong's capital market, including promoting some large companies to list in Hong Kong,\" Ng said. \"Hong Kong's IPO market may see further improvement in the second half of the year.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Ng said Chapter 18C has its challenges, including the limited industries it benefits. The rule applies to applicants in five sectors: hi-tech, advanced hardware and software, new materials, new energy and food and agriculture technologies.\n\n\"It has very detailed regulations on industries and businesses,\" Ng said. \"Therefore, for other companies that do not develop in these industries or fields, the possibility of using this chapter to go public is not very high.\"\n\nQuantumPharm will use most of its IPO proceeds to enhance research and development capabilities and provide its solutions.\n\nThe company posted an adjusted net loss of 522 million yuan (US$72 million) for 2023, widening from a loss of 437 million yuan in 2022.\n\nTencent owns 13.66 per cent of QuantumPharm, which also counts HongShan, Google and SoftBank Group among its shareholders.\n\nFounded in 2015 by three quantum physicists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, QuantumPharm says it combines quantum physics, AI, cloud computing and robotics to provide R&D services and products for the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, renewable energy and advanced materials industries.\n\nCitic Securities is the sole sponsor of QuantumPharm's IPO.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 50 Richest Countries in the World by GDP and in this article we will talk about the country with the largest GDP in the world.\n\nGlobal Economic Outlook of Richest Countries\n\nThe global economy has been facing strong headwinds since the COVID-19 pandemic including the world's richest countries by GDP. The major economic issues include high inflation, high interest rates, and geopolitical risks. Japan\u2019s economic situation looks bleak and the country\u2019s GDP has plunged during the last two quarters. Japan's GDP shrank by 3.3% in Q1 2024 and 0.4% in Q4 2023 year-over-year. In the ongoing economic shift, Japan lost its position as the third-largest economy with its GDP at around $6.72 trillion, as of 2024. On May 9, Reuters reported that the Bank of Japan could raise interest rates if the yen drops sharply, leading to higher inflation. Recently, the Bank of Japan ended eight years of negative interest rates, changing the policy following decades of aggressive monetary easing. Japan\u2019s new interest rate ranges between 0% to 0.1%. Japan\u2019s central bank board member, Seiji Adachi, said that the bank can move towards increased interest rates if excessive yen falls persist. Adachi further added:\n\n\"We must by all means avoid raising interest rates prematurely. But by focusing too much on downside risks, we could see inflation accelerate in a way that forces us to tighten monetary policy sharply later on. As long as underlying inflation continues to head toward 2%, it's important to gradually adjust the degree of monetary support reflecting economic, price, and financial developments.\"\n\nIn the global economic shift, another major economy that has been in the limelight for fighting the recession is the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has been surpassed by India, Russia, Indonesia, and Brazil as the richest countries in the world by GDP. The UK\u2019s inflation is measured at 2.3% compared to 3.4% in the US and 2.4% in the eurozone.\u00a0On May 27, Olli Rehn, the European Central Bank governing council member in a speech said that the inflation rate in the eurozone is falling in a \u2018sustained way.\u2019 Rehn further said, \u201cThe time is thus ripe in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates.\u201d\n\nChina, the largest manufacturing country in the world, has received an upgrade on its economic outlook from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). On May 28, the IMF reported that it has revised China\u2019s economic outlook, increasing growth by 0.4 percentage points for 2024. As per the updated projection, China\u2019s economy is expected to grow by 5% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025. One of the major reasons for the upside in China\u2019s economic growth is the downside expected in the property sector. Here is what the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director, Ms. Gita Gopinath, said:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe ongoing housing market correction, which is necessary for steering the sector towards a more sustainable path, should continue. The authorities have implemented various welcome measures to guide the property market transition, including recent policy announcements regarding lending support for affordable housing.\u201d\n\nThe US economy is projected to have a 2.7% growth rate in 2024, a slightly higher growth compared to 2.5% in 2023. In 2025, the growth for the US is anticipated to decline to 1.9%. The chief US economist, Andrew Hollenhorst, in a CNBC interview, said that they are not seeing a soft landing in the US. Hollenhorst pointed, \u201cWe're just not seeing (soft landing) it in the data.\u201d\n\nOverall, the global economy is set to continue growth at 3.2% during 2024 and 2025. In advanced economies, the growth is projected to stay under 2% in 2024 and 2025, while emerging markets and developing economies expect a 4.2% growth in 2024 and 2025. As per the IMF's forecast, India will be the leading economy with an anticipated growth rate of 6.8% and 6.5% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nChina Vs United States: An Economic Tassle\n\nChina and the United States have been up against each other for decades now. China\u2019s stellar economic growth has led the country to directly compete with the US economy. As per the IMF, China\u2019s anticipated growth rate of 5% and 4.5% for 2024 and 2025 is almost double the expected growth rate of the US. However, the Chinese economy has been struggling with a property crisis, which has left a huge dent in the real estate market. On April 16, Reuters reported that the new home prices in China plunged by 2.2% in March 2024 from a year ago, representing the biggest decline since August 2015. The property downturn in China will lead to a 0.3 percentage point decline in Chinese GDP growth in 2024, as per the economists at ANZ. Whereas, property investment is expected to decline by 12% in 2024. Despite the downsides, China is on track to be the largest economy in the world by 2030. In addition, China is one of the richest countries in the world by net worth, having a total wealth of $85.10 trillion in 2021. The US had the highest total wealth of around $145.79 trillion, as of 2021.\n\nThe US economy is suffering from interest rate hikes and heading towards a potential recession. The expected growth of 1.9% in 2025 indicates recessionary risks. Moreover, the high inflation has kept the Fed to keep the interest rates between 5.25% to 5.5%. On May 21, CNBC reported that Fed Governor, Christopher Waller, pointed out that he would need to see several months of inflation data before deciding to lower rates.\n\nCompanies Backing the Largest Economies\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the largest retailers in the US. On May 16, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) reported its earnings for the first quarter of 2025. The company posted earnings per share of $0.60, surpassing consensus estimates by $0.07. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) reported a revenue of around $159.94 billion, beating estimates by $1.67 billion. Here are some of the comments from the Q1 2025 earnings call:\n\n\u201cOur results were stronger than we anticipated with sales growth of 5.7% and adjusted operating profit, up 12.9% in constant currency. All three operating segments performed well. The momentum we see across the businesses driven by growth in units sold and transaction counts, as well as market share gains, including general merchandise. These are not inflation-driven results. In the U.S., like-for-like sales inflation was about 40 basis points for the quarter, including mid-single-digit deflation in general merchandise and low-single-digit inflation in food and consumables. Together with our suppliers, we\u2019re making progress lowering prices.\u201d\n\nTencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) is one of the largest tech companies in China. Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) is supporting the economy through its next generation of low-carbon technologies. In March 2023, Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) launched CarbonX to reduce its carbon footprint. The tech giant has committed over $28 million over the next three years to support innovative ideas that will focus on technology-based carbon removal. On May 23, Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) reported that it will award a total of $14 million to 13 teams that won the first phase of the CarbonX program.\n\nThe world\u2019s richest countries by GDP are backed by strong multinationals.

        "content": "Tencent Holdings on Thursday launched an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot app called Yuanbao, as the video gaming and social media giant races to catch up with other Chinese technology companies in developing applications to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nYuanbao can be used to analyse and summarise documents, provide questions and answers, and generate texts and images, similar to the functions of ChatGPT and alternative Chinese AI chatbots.\n\nTencent's AI assistant was built on the company's own large language model (LLM) - the technology behind ChatGPT and other generative AI services - known as Hunyuan.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHunyuan has been in a continuous process of enhancement over the past year and is now a trillion-parameter model, Tencent said on Thursday. An LLM is a deep-learning algorithm, trained on mountains of raw data from the internet, that can be adapted to accomplish tasks in various AI applications.\n\nTencent Holdings' Yuanbao artificial intelligence assistant is now available in app stores on the mainland. Photo: Weibo alt=Tencent Holdings' Yuanbao artificial intelligence assistant is now available in app stores on the mainland. Photo: Weibo>\n\nThe launch of Yuanbao shows Tencent's confidence to somehow close the gap with Chinese tech firms' that have had a head start in building ChatGPT-like services, including Baidu, ByteDance and Moonshot AI.\n\nYuanbao's search results, for example, are accessible to the vast content ecosystem of Tencent's WeChat. The multipurpose super app has a publishing platform called Official Accounts where creators can post articles and information, but this content is not accessible to search engines like Baidu or Google.\n\nAlthough the Yuanbao app's release comes several months behind its peers, it follows Tencent's strategy. Company founder, chairman and chief executive Pony Ma Huateng previously said the firm would adopt a more measured pace in developing generative AI products.\n\nThis month, Tencent launched an upgraded version of its Hunyuan LLM that provides text-to-image generation that is open source for enterprises and individuals. The company also slashed prices of its AI model to join a full-fledged LLM price war in the domestic market.\n\nThe Yuanbao artificial intelligence chatbot is the latest consumer-oriented app from Tencent Holdings. Photo: Weibo alt=The Yuanbao artificial intelligence chatbot is the latest consumer-oriented app from Tencent Holdings. Photo: Weibo>\n\nStory continues\n\nTencent, however, has much ground to cover. ByteDance, for example, has said that its Doubao app has amassed more than 26 million monthly active users, while Baidu last month claimed 200 million users for Ernie Bot.\n\nSubject to strict censorship rules, Chinese AI chatbots tend to avoid or stick to official lines in response to sensitive political questions. Yuanbao, for example, processed and responded to questions regarding democracy on the mainland and Taiwan with textbook answers, similar to results from Baidu's Ernie Bot and Moonshot AI's Kimi, according to tests conducted by the South China Morning Post on Thursday.\n\nWhen asked to provide a summary of Chinese President Xi Jinping's book The Governance of China, Yuanbao was able to provide a 1,000-word essay with several key points from the book. The other chatbots seemed more reluctant to respond to questions that mention the names of the country's political leaders.\n\nKimi started processing related articles for a few seconds and then suggested to \"change another topic and chat more\". Ernie Bot, meanwhile, gave a brief introduction of the book and then closed the input box, so the user can start a new conversation.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Photo: Tencent alt=Tencent Holdings senior vice-president Steven Ma Xiaoyi.

        "content": "By Josh Ye\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings' mobile game \"Dungeon and Fighter\" was the top-selling app on Apple's App Store in China this week, surpassing the company's existing flagship games after it spent years looking for a new marquee title.\n\nThe side-scrolling action game, developed by South Korea's Nexon and published by Tencent, became the top-selling app in China hours after it was launched on May 21 and it has stayed there since, according to app tracking platform Appmagic.\n\nTencent's \"Honor of Kings\" and \"Peacekeeper Elites\" have long been China's most popular games but they have recently shown signs of declining revenue as their popularity ebbed.\n\nGlobally, \"Dungeon and Fighter\" mobile ranked as the world's second top-selling app last week, only behind short video platform TikTok and ahead of Honor of Kings and YouTube, which came in third and fourth, according to Appmagic.\n\nThe video game is estimated to have earned more than $40 million in revenue on Apple devices after receiving over 2.4 million downloads, according to Appmagic.\n\nRobin Zhu, senior analyst at Bernstein, said that Appmagic's number aligns with data recorded by another app tracking firm called Sensor Tower.\n\nBut he said that the game actually makes more money because the $40 million figure was only Tencent's and Nexon's cut, excluding Apple's share of the revenue.\n\n\"Gross billings-wise, the Sensor Tower data suggests you're looking at 1.2 to 1.5 billion yuan ($206.95 million) of receipts since launch,\" he said. Gross billing refers to the gross amount that users have spent on the game.\n\nHe said that \"Dungeon and Fighter\" mobile's strong performance is on track to meet Nexon's expectation of 3 billion yuan in gross billings during the game's first month of launch.\n\nOfficially named \"Dungeon and Fighter: Origin\", the game is a mobile adaptation of the \"Dungeon and Fighter\" computer game, one of the world's most profitable computer games which Tencent also publishes.\n\nThe game, under development for seven years, was released in South Korea in 2022 and became an instant hit. But its China release was delayed after the government cracked down on the gaming industry between 2018 and 2022.\n\n($1 = 7.2483 Chinese yuan)\n\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)\n\nView comments",

That would translate into more than $140 million in player spending across all mobile platforms including Android stores, gaming researcher Niko Partners estimated.\n\nDnF Mobile, based on developer Nexon Co.\u2019s long-running franchise, has topped the download and grossing charts over the past week, with 2.6 million downloads on iPhones in China, Sensor Tower data showed. In a sign of its overwhelming popularity, Tencent had to suspend the game within an hour of its launch, citing unspecified server glitches.\n\nThe game\u2019s arrival in China, delayed by several years by a Beijing crackdown on the internet industry that included a halt to game approvals, is welcome news for a company in search of its next big profit driver. DnF Mobile pushed perennial Tencent hits Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite down from the top spots, giving the Shenzhen-based company the top three most profitable games in the country last week.\n\nNow investor interest turns to how well Tencent is able to sustain the initial popularity of its newest action role-playing game. The company did everything possible to ensure a fast launch, including inserting animated ads for the game\u2019s release into WeChat conversations that included mentions of its title or even words like \u201cwarrior.\u201d\n\nDnF Mobile\u2019s stellar debut could translate into more than $1 billion in sales for Tencent this year \u2014 or roughly 5% of its domestic games sales \u2014 should the momentum be sustained, according to estimates by Niko Partners analyst Xiaofeng Zeng.\n\n\u201cTop-notch franchises like DnF have proved their longevity and money-making power,\u201d Zeng said. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s still too soon to tell whether DnF Mobile will be the next Honor of Kings for Tencent. The first-week revenue is in line with our expectation, but that\u2019s the result of aggressive marketing campaigns.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nBy comparison, 2020 hit Genshin Impact \u2014 from Chinese anime specialist Mihoyo \u2014 generated about $60 million in its first-week revenue globally, Sensor Tower estimated. The data excluded third-party Android stores in China.\n\nNew game releases in China were hamstrung by a prolonged pause in license approvals, and Tencent plans to ramp up launches as the year goes along. The company on Tuesday highlighted over a dozen upcoming debuts at its annual games event, including the highly anticipated console title Black Myth: Wukong.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNew York\u2019s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point Elon Musk Still Has Friends in Silicon Valley When Business Is Just a Game The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade The Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn\u2019t\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tencent Deploys AI to Help Researchers Decipher Hidden Meanings in Oracle Bone Scripts",
        "content": "Online research platform Oracle Bones Corpus welcomes contributions from researchers and enthusiasts\n\nSHENZHEN, China, May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Tencent\u00a0(00700.HK) today announced the launch of Oracle Bones Corpus (\u6bb7\u5951\u6587\u6e0a), an online research platform and database for oracle bone researchers and enthusiasts. This revamped website not only offers new innovative tools for visualizing shallow indentations, but also employs artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the efficiency of mapping glyphs to modern Chinese characters. Available in Simplified Chinese, the platform is now live at https://www.jgwlbq.org.cn/home.\n\nFirst discovered in the early 20th century, oracle bones record some of the oldest known iterations of Chinese characters, dating back millennia. To date, around 160,000 pieces of oracle bones have been discovered, from which around 4,500 unique characters have been found. While significant progress has been made, deciphering the scripts remains a challenge. Among all the characters which have been found, less than half (approximately 1,500 characters) have been matched to their modern counterparts.\n\nOracle Bones\u00a0Corpus aims to a provide mature, standardized system and technological tool for conducting effective research. Its database lets researchers examine and compare \u2013 either side-by-side or layered on top of each other in an interactive viewer \u2013 the different digitized versions of oracle bones, including historical photos, high-resolution 3D models, as well as digital replicas and enhanced ink rubbings.\n\nWith the new update, Oracle Bones\u00a0Corpus introduces tools that directly address the main difficulties associated with studying oracle bones: visualization and character recognition. Because of their fragility, the priceless oracle bones are often prohibited from being handled. The pieces are also scattered across China and the world, further restricting access. For a long time, researchers have had to depend on Chinese ink rubbings and photographic copies, but the quality of the records produced by these methods falls short of modern expectations. Tencent's Indentation Highlight (\u5fae\u75d5\u589e\u5f3a) feature offers a solution by enhancing the visibility of shallow carvings on the oracle bones. This allows for a detailed analysis of the strokes that form the glyphs and the chiseled grooves at the back.\n\nFor character recognition, researchers previously had to laboriously compare each image and sometimes even resort to hand-drawn notes to find recurring glyphs.\u00a0This AI assistance significantly boosts the efficiency and accuracy of deciphering ancient Chinese text. Additionally, characters are indexed for easy searchability, allowing researchers and interested users to quickly\u00a0locate relevant academic papers for further study. By harnessing the technology, researchers can greatly shorten the processing time of oracle bones.\n\nStory continues\n\nCommenting on the initiative, Zhan Shu, Head of Digital Culture Lab, Tencent's Sustainable Social Value, said, \"With Oracle Bones\u00a0Corpus, we have established a platform for all the stakeholders in oracle bone research to work together toward a common goal. We look forward to seeing more oracle bones digitized and invite researchers and anthropology enthusiasts to decipher the secrets of these ancient texts.\"\n\nIn promotion of oracle bone research, Tencent also co-developed the Amazing Oracle Bones (\u4e86\u4e0d\u8d77\u7684\u7532\u9aa8\u6587) educational Weixin Mini Program. Through fun, interactive experiences such as word of the day, 3D model viewing and oracle bone trivia quizzes, the Mini Program aims to raise public awareness and interest in oracle bone research. Additionally, users may also submit their interpretations of unidentified characters to researchers through the Mini Program and contribute to the on-going deciphering efforts.\n\nOracle Bones Corpus and Amazing Oracle Bones Weixin Mini Program are both live and open to the public.

At present, only 1,500 of these characters have been successfully identified to match with modern Chinese characters.\n\nTencent on Tuesday said it also developed an educational mini program on its super appWeChat for users interested in learning about the oracle bones.\n\nMicrosoft last year worked with Chinese university researchers through its Project Diviner, which used AI to curate and restore inscriptions on the oracle bones.\n\nBefore its Oracle Bones Corpus platform, Tencent in February started work with China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism in using AI and virtual reality technologies to restore decades-old video recordings of traditional Chinese operas.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

WeChat Pay is currently available in 69 countries and regions.\n\nWeChat Pay's expansion to the Maldives reflects the opportunities in the gradual rebound of Chinese holidaymakers heading overseas amid Beijing's new visa policies and increased international flights.\n\nChina recently signed several mutual visa-free pacts with various countries - including Singapore, Thailand and Georgia - to encourage travel, as mainland tourists increasingly prefer trips to visa-free destinations.\n\nAccording to Chinese travel agency Touniu earlier this month, outbound tourists on the platform accounted for 27 per cent of total tourists during the May Day holiday, up 190 per cent year on year.\n\nThe Maldives, where Chinese passport holders can visit for 30 days without a visa, has long been a popular destination for mainland holidaymakers. China is also the biggest source of inbound travellers for the Maldives, which accounted for 11 per cent of its total tourists, according to official data.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Tencent Cloud ... will continue to provide competitive products and services to the customers,\" the company statement said.\n\nTencent's announcement came just hours after iFlyTek significantly reduced the price of some versions of its Spark LLM, while making its lite version free.\n\nTencent and iFlyTek are the latest tech giants to join the LLM price war in China, which started last week when TikTok owner ByteDance launched Doubao AI models for enterprises, touting prices that were 99.8 per cent lower than OpenAI's GPT-4 model.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post, and Baidu quickly followed this week. Alibaba Cloud Intelligence cut the price for its Qwen LLM by up to 97 per cent on Tuesday. On the same day, Chinese search giant Baidu said its Ernie Speed and Ernie Lite LLMs, both launched earlier this year, were available free of charge with immediate effect.\n\nThe cloud services units of these Big Tech firms are cutting prices in the hope of exploring more effective ways to commercialise their LLMs, said Zhang Yi, analyst at tech research firm Canalys.\n\n\"Commercialising AI models has always been a pain point for the industry, as it is still an unsolved issue to implement and utilise the technology effectively in real-world business scenarios,\" Zhang said.\n\nMajor AI players are reducing their prices to attract more customers and increase LLM usage, which will contribute to higher training data volume and enable the companies to improve the precision and accuracy of the models, Zhang noted.\n\nSignage for Tencent outside the company's headquarters in Shenzhen, China, April 17, 2024.

        "title": "Tencent Announces Winners of Flagship CarbonX Program to Combat Climate Change",
        "content": "SHENZHEN, China, May 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Tencent (00700.HK) is awarding 13 exceptional teams that won the first phase of its groundbreaking CarbonX Program, which is aimed at boosting promising new climate technologies. The winners, which emerged from a pool of 30 finalists and more than 300 initial applications, will receive a total of around RMB 100 million (US$14 million) in financial support from Tencent. It showcases the company's commitment to driving sustainable social innovations in the fight against climate change.\n\nCarbonX was launched in March 2023 to advance the next generation of low-carbon technologies. Tencent has committed RMB 200 million (US$28 million) in catalytic funding over the next three years to innovative ideas that might otherwise languish or fail to gain traction.\n\nCarbonX's first phase focused on carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), as well as technology-based carbon removal. These solutions were chosen for their unique ability to curb emissions from hard-to-abate industries such as steel and cement, mitigate the continued reliance on fossil fuels, and reduce legacy emissions created from decades of industrialization.\n\nBacked by Tencent's mission of Tech for Good and an alliance of like-minded industry partners, CarbonX aims to help these cutting-edge technologies make the leap from the research or early startup stage to commercial scale. The ultimate goal is supporting them in making a significant impact toward the targets outlined in the Paris Agreement, which includes a 45 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nDr. Hao Xu, Tencent's Vice President of Sustainable Social Value and Head of Tencent's Carbon Neutrality Lab, said: \"Technology innovation serves as the driving force to accelerate our progress toward achieving carbon neutrality. CarbonX program is aimed at fostering the growth of these technologies, driving positive impact across society, and laying the groundwork for a more sustainable future.\"\n\nProfessor Jerry Yan, Chair Professor of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Co-chairman of the CarbonX expert committee, said: \"To pave the path for a greener economy, we must champion the development of cutting-edge low-carbon technologies. Just as solar and wind power were nurtured in their infancy, emerging solutions like CCUS and tech-based carbon removal demand our early support.\"\n\nThe program assembled a panel of experts from academia, industries, and the investor community as the jury, and welcomed submissions from diverse participants across three distinct tracks:\n\nStory continues\n\nCarbonX Lab: Designed to incubate research institutions, universities, or labs that bring in game-changing climate solutions CarbonX Accelerator: Designed to accelerate the growth of climate-tech startups that exhibit commercialization potential CarbonX Infrastructure: Designed to support capacity building to facilitate industry development\n\nThe finalists comprise four projects from the Lab track, six from the Accelerator track, and three from the Infrastructure track. These projects explore innovative solutions, such as using steel slag to capture and store carbon directly from furnace exhaust, converting CO2 into sustainable aviation fuel and valuable chemicals through electrochemical reactions or microorganisms, and employing new approaches to directly capture CO2 from the atmosphere with the hope of slashing the cost to less than US$150 per ton.\n\nMeanwhile, Tencent is also collaborating with Tsinghua University to develop a comprehensive system of Measure, Reporting and Verification (MRV) tools to accurately gauge progress toward decarbonization.\n\nAside from receiving financial and advisory support, several projects will also have the opportunity to collaborate with industry partners and test their research beyond the laboratory setting.\n\nBuilding upon the success of the first phase, Tencent is poised to launch the second iteration of CarbonX globally as early as later this year in pursuit of early-stage climate tech innovation.

        "content": "Tencent Holdings' Dungeon and Fighter (DnF) Mobile launched with an overwhelming start, as the Chinese tech giant pins high hopes on the eagerly awaited title to boost its sluggish domestic video game business.\n\nThe mobile version of DnF, developed by Japanese-Korean game studio Nexon, remained top of the charts for free game downloads on the iOS app store on Wednesday, after experiencing problems shortly after its official debut in China on Tuesday, when some players said they experienced online queues and were unable to log in.\n\nTencent, which operates the game in China, cited a server outage for the incident as it trumpeted the \"fiery enthusiasm\" from players for the game.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe server supporting the game needed to undergo emergency maintenance that was estimated to take around 90 minutes, DnF Mobile said on its official Weibo account, where it also pledged to compensate all players with in-game coins and gifts. The game resumed operations an hour later with some functions still unavailable.\n\nWith the outage an indication of overwhelming demand for DnF Mobile, Tencent, which operates the world's largest video gaming business by revenue, may have good reason to pin hopes on the title giving its gaming business a boost.\n\n\"DnF Mobile is a key title for us given the success and longevity of the DnF [personal computer game] and the general scarcity of successful action games on mobile,\" Tencent president Martin Lau said in a conference call in March, weeks after the title received regulatory approval to launch in China.\n\nDnF Mobile is expected to gross around 6 billion yuan (US$836 million) in a year, according to a recent note by investment bank Jefferies.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, video gaming revenue, traditionally Tencent's strongest revenue driver, declined 2 per cent in the domestic market while rising 3 per cent overseas, reaching 34.5 billion yuan and 13.6 billion yuan, respectively.\n\nTencent's headquarters building in Shenzhen, China, April 17, 2024.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy Immediately Following Strong Earnings",
        "content": "The stock market continues to prove its resilience despite concerns over persistent inflation. A lot of that resilience is attributable to strong earnings reports overall. Most of the S&P 500 has reported earnings. Fortunately, the benchmark index is growing even faster than expected, pointing to continued strengths on the earnings front.\n\nStrategists from leading investment firms continue to be optimistic about the strength of the stock market despite the Fed\u2019s response to underlying economic conditions.\n\nThat optimism serves as a catalyst for investors seeking to capitalize on the strong earnings data in the first quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInflation declined slightly in April, offering renewed hope for future cuts. The Fed will not cut rates on that data but offers some hope following months of negative data. That data suggests investors should consider these stocks to buy after earnings.\n\nTencent (TCEHY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) stock continues to surge higher following strong news related to its video segment. That strong news resulted in a big earnings beat.\n\nThe company continues to make extraordinary progress against its main competitor ByteDance, the owner of TikTok. Tencent operates WeChat, which has seen its video accounts soar of late. The company has been investing a lot of resources in order to claw back market share from ByteDance and TikTok. Those efforts are bearing fruit: Users spent 80% more time on Tencent\u2019s video accounts, leading to a 26% increase in ad sales.\n\nThe strong performance resulted in a 62% increase in net income at Tencent. In turn, analysts expect positive earnings revisions for Tencent moving forward. That\u2019s an excellent reason to believe share prices could move higher again in the immediate term.\n\nOverall, the news is very strong for Chinese stocks and suggests the country\u2019s gaming and internet sectors remain particularly strong.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported earnings on April 25, showing a more than 17% increase in revenues. Earnings were even stronger, with net income increasing by 20%. There are dozens of reasons to be positive about Microsoft stock, the earnings are but one.\n\nAnyway, March EPS figures were 3.4% higher than anticipated. Investors have grown to expect double-digit growth from Microsoft in the last few years. Thus, those same investors have to refer to the guidance in order to ascertain whether that double-digit growth is, in fact, strong. The 3.4% beat indicates it is.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t without concerns at the moment. Investors continue to wonder how successful the company will be at monetizing AI in relation to its office products. Time will tell, but investors should also realize Microsoft is incredibly strong elsewhere. Intelligent Cloud Revenue increased by 21%, soaring to $26.7 billion. The company was also successful in growing less important segments, including LinkedIn where revenues increased by 10%.\n\nImpinj (PI) Two businesspeople holding and pointing at earnings charts.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvestors who followed Impinj (NASDAQ:PI)\u00a0over the last few quarters have grown accustomed to strong earnings. The first quarter of 2024 has started no differently for the firm, which operates a cloud connectivity platform.\n\nThe platform includes integrated circuits that wirelessly connect physical items and data to the platform. The performance and growth of the firm have made it one of the Internet of Things companies to pay attention to.\n\nThe company reported 21 cents of earnings during the first quarter on 76.8 million in sales. Those figures were far better than the anticipated numbers of 10 cents on $73.6 million. As impressive as those numbers were, it\u2019s the forward guidance that should truly interest investors.\n\nAnalysts had been expecting $79 million in sales in Q2 and earnings of 19 cents prior to the strong earnings. Impinj guided for $97.5 million in sales and 75 cents of earnings, blowing away Wall Street.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock remains something of a mystery following its earnings report a few weeks ago. On the one hand, earnings during the quarter were better than expected, providing reason for investors to remain positive. However, the company also gave second-quarter guidance for sales slightly below the $150 billion Wall Street had been anticipating.\n\nThere\u2019s reason to believe that Amazon will do better than it is currently predicting. For one, AWS is now at a $100 billion annual revenue run rate. Cloud is integral to so many of the current trends making Amazon immediately relevant. That brings me to my next point \u2014 artificial intelligence. I think investors will see Amazon really ramp up its artificial intelligence investment in the coming weeks. I believe that because Jeff Bezos is apparently worried the company is falling behind on that front. Thus, the company will likely react by projecting strength over the coming weeks. That could include announcements of further investments.\n\nEmergent BioSolutions (EBS) Scientist using a microscope\n\nSource: Maksim Shmeljov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEmergent BioSolutions (NYSE:EBS) is a life sciences company and stock that provides products ranging from Narcan nasal spray to anthrax injections. It\u2019s also a company that recently reported exceptionally strong earnings, prompting potential investment.\n\nOn May 1st the company reported 59 cents of earnings on $300.4 million in sales. The market had been expecting $224.5 million in sales, leading to -84 earnings. Share prices have essentially tripled since the news was announced two weeks ago. Share prices continue to move higher by double digits, suggesting further opportunity ahead.\n\nNarcan contributed $118.5 million of the $300.4 million in sales during the first quarter. The surprise profitability during the quarter looks to have prompted a shift toward efficiency. The company concurrently announced a strategic realignment, resulting in the loss of 300 jobs as the company further focuses on its Narcan opportunity. Investing in the stock is one of the clearest ways to capitalize on America\u2019s ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors curious to understand whether AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) will continue to grow should consider this recent article from Yahoo! Finance.\n\nThe title gets straight to the point. Although AMD beat the first quarter guidance, a weak Q2 forecast cast doubt on its shares as an investment at the moment. The story is pretty straightforward otherwise: AMD is doing extraordinarily well as it relates to hyperscalers and the data center opportunity, but gaming revenues continue to be weak.\n\nMany leading companies have announced deployments of AMD\u2019s M1 300X chips. However, the company\u2019s guidance is not what Wall Street was looking for. The data center opportunity continues to be strong and is expected to grow at double-digit rates, while gaming revenues are expected to continue declining.\n\nInvestors should be optimistic, as April inflation data shows the economy is cooling. That renews hope for rate cuts in the coming months, likely September, that will prompt significant increases in AI spending at the enterprise level.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is again being propelled primarily by the strength of its search business. Ad revenues from Google Search are again strong, the primary reason investors should consider buying Google. The company has again returned to the strengths that have made it what it has become over the past decade or so.\n\nMeanwhile, the company continues to invest in generative AI in order to further those strengths. Revenue from Google services accounted for nearly 88% of overall revenues. Those revenues increased by 13.6% rising to $70.4 billion, ahead of expectations.\n\nYouTube was another bright spot for the company. Ad revenues from YouTube increased nearly 21%, growing to $8.1 billion. Furthermore, Google Cloud\u2019s revenues grew by more than 28% during the period.\n\nOverall, Google\u2019s stock is again strong on the strengths of its search business. Meanwhile, the company is well-positioned to apply artificial intelligence to that segment and others. Those investments could strengthen future results substantially, which is why investors should buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. slashed prices for a clutch of artificial intelligence services by as much as 97%, spurring an immediate response from Baidu Inc. in potentially the start of a price war in China\u2019s nascent AI market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy Iran State TV Says \u2018No Sign of Life\u2019 at Helicopter Crash Site Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is \u2018Well on the Way\u2019 One of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks Florida\u2019s 125% Surge in Property-Insurance Bills Sows Havoc\n\nBaidu Cloud said it would offer free services based on its Ernie AI models on Tuesday, hours after Alibaba offered deals on nine products built atop its own Tongyi Qianwen. ByteDance Ltd. last week announced pricing for AI services that it said were 99% lower than Chinese industry norms, using Ernie and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen as benchmarks.\n\nThe tit-for-tat maneuvers mark the opening salvos of a price-based battle within AI, a field that\u2019s attracting billions of dollars of investment from startups and internet leaders including Tencent Holdings Ltd. The flurry of investment has created scores of AI models and spawned many more consumer and enterprise products in turn, all fighting for the critical mass of users needed to speed AI development.\n\nChina\u2019s tech companies have for years relied heavily on discounts across markets from e-commerce to food delivery and ride-hailing. Alibaba this year spurred a cascade of price reductions in cloud computing, after it offered discounts as much as 55% on more than 100 domestic services in March. That was followed that same day by rounds of discounts from rival JD.com Inc.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nAlibaba\u2019s decision to cut pricing on its Large Language Models (LLM) by up to 97% will likely further disrupt China\u2019s AI market, pushing the sector into a price war. The move is probably in response to ByteDance\u2019s recently launched Doubao LLMs, which were priced at a deep discount to the market. We expect Baidu, Tencent and JD.com to respond in due course.\n\n- Robert Lea, BI analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nShares in Alibaba slid 1% while Baidu dived close to 4% in Hong Kong.\n\nChinese tech pioneers have joined Silicon Valley peers like Microsoft Corp. in placing big bets on generative AI. Beside developing their own in-house foundation models, they\u2019re pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into up-and-coming outfits like Baichuan and Zhipu AI.\n\nAlibaba has gone through a year of tumultuous restructuring to try and claw back users for its cloud business, which also hosts its main AI effort. It stunned investors by calling off a planned spinoff of the arm into an independent, publicly traded unit.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company \u2014 now under the helm of Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wu \u2014 has focused on growing its public cloud, the domestic services arm aimed at enterprise customers. It\u2019s gone through a major revamp to stem market share losses to traditional rivals like Baidu and Tencent as well as state-backed entrants and relative newcomers like Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nRead more: TikTok Parent ByteDance Now Has China\u2019s Most Popular AI Chatbot\n\n--With assistance from Gao Yuan.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "Tencent Suspends Marquee Game After Servers Buckle on Debut",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. suspended Dungeon & Fighter Mobile within an hour of its Chinese debut because of unspecified server glitches, suggesting players flooded the online platform for one of 2024\u2019s most highly anticipated titles.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy ASML and TSMC Can Disable Chip Machines If China Invades Taiwan Iran State TV Says \u2018No Sign of Life\u2019 at Helicopter Crash Site Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is \u2018Well on the Way\u2019 One of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks\n\nTencent, which had been preparing for the launch for months, took down the game for maintenance after what it called \u201cserver fluctuations,\u201d without elaborating. The abrupt take-down was regarded as a sign that the number of players overwhelmed the servers dedicated to hosting the game \u2014 a common occurrence for many long-awaited releases.\n\nDnF Mobile, based on developer Nexon Co.\u2019s long-running franchise, is a key title for hit-hungry Tencent, as the world\u2019s biggest games publisher replenishes its aging portfolio. New game releases in China were hamstrung by a prolonged halt in license approvals, and Tencent plans to ramp up releases as the year goes along. Its gaming revenue is estimated to grow by double-digits this quarter after a long period of contraction, aided in part by the new role-playing game.\n\nTencent\u2019s shares were down about 3% before the lunch break, but off their morning low. The company compensated players with virtual coins and other in-game items as it worked to rectify login issues. The game resumed for players after a little over an hour, though not all functions were available.\n\nRead More: Tencent Shares Climb Most in Months as Blockbuster Debuts Early\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nThe launch-day server outage of Tencent\u2019s highly-anticipated new game DnF Mobile is a potential sign of strong demand for the title. The disruption is unlikely to have a material impact on its earnings. The rebound in Tencent\u2019s 1Q domestic game receipts provided confidence the recovery in its China video game business can continue though the rest of 2024, though at a more modest pace than recent years. We expect China\u2019s video game market to grow 6% in 2024, down from 13.9% in 2023.\n\n\u2014 Robert Lea and Jasmine Lyu, BI analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nDnF Mobile quickly took the top spot as the most downloaded free game on the iPhone app store in China, and the title has garnered over 60 million player registrations across platforms pre-launch.\n\nTencent had sought to bring the game to China as far back as 2020, but that coincided with the height of a Beijing regulatory crackdown that imposed new rules on internet companies. Nexon said at the time it was delaying the title to comply with restrictions aimed at curbing addiction among minors.\n\nStory continues\n\nChinese regulators granted DnF Mobile a commercial license in February, and Tencent executives said they fast-tracked its launch after seeing positive testing results.\n\nRead More: Tencent, Nexon Soar After Surprise Approval for Marquee Game\n\n(Updates with share action and context from the first paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "content": "China's video gaming regulator approved 96 new titles for domestic release in May, it said on Monday, just under the 95 approvals in April.\n\nAlthough the titles approved this month do not include games developed by industry leaders Tencent Holdings or NetEase, at least four have investments from Tencent, which runs the world's biggest video gaming business by revenue.\n\nThose four include Bingyuanxinghuo from Century Games and Texunjingying by Wizard Games, according to the list published by the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), the government body in charge of licensing video games in China.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nOther major companies were behind this month's new titles, including Tafengxing from Hong Kong-listed Archosaur Games and Renjing, whose developer Shanghai Magic Sword Network Technology Co is backed by Genshin Impact operator miHoYo, according to NPPA's list.\n\nAlthough the latest approvals are fewer in number compared to those in the past three months, the regulator has continued to step up the pace of approvals as Chinese authorities try to restore confidence in the industry.\n\nThe first three months of the year each saw more than 100 new titles approved. As a result, a total of 524 new domestic titles have been released in the first five months of 2024 compared with 1,075 for all of last year.\n\nIn January, the regulator retracted a draft proposal it published in December that aimed to put a cap on user spending in games and ban \"excessive\" rewards. That proposal caused at least US$80 billion in value to be erased from Chinese video gaming stocks in Shanghai, Hong Kong and New York.\n\nA key Chinese government official later stepped down, as the NPPA moved to withdraw that proposal, according to a South China Morning Post report, which cited people familiar with the matter.\n\nSeparately, Blizzard Entertainment's remarriage with old partner NetEase in April will see the comeback of titles like World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Hearthstone on the Chinese mainland after more than a year's absence.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Nvidia, Marks &amp; Spencer, Ryanair and UK inflation",
        "content": "Nvidia earnings are coming but the rally can't continue forever. (AFP Contributor via Getty Images)\n\nEarnings season is coming to an end but some major names are yet to report. Investors have some high expectations for some of the key companies reporting next week such as Nvidia and Marks and Spencer.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) \u2014 Reports on Wednesday 22 May\n\nThe darling of AI and technology investors will report results from its first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on 22 May.\n\nThe AI boom would not be possible without the chips from Nvidia, with the chipmaker seeing shares surge by 239% last year.\n\nWith demand far outstripping supply for its graphics processing units, investors will want to know if Nvidia \u2014 the last of the Mag 7 to report \u2014 can keep driving the AI-related rally the market enjoyed over the past year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNvidia is anticipated to report earnings of $5.49 per share for the current quarter, marking an increase of 403.7% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe earnings are projected to be $23.94 per share and a revenue of $106.05bn (\u00a383.8bn) for the entire fiscal year, according to TradingView.\n\nRead more: Mag 7 stocks including Apple and Amazon still holding strong\n\n\"The AI hype-train is not only rolling but delivering, as far as Nvidia is concerned. Momentum investors seem happy to pile in, although value seekers are likely to be more reticent, given the lofty valuation which leaves little room for error. In the final quarter of fiscal 2023, Nvidia ran a $2.7bn share buyback,\" Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nHowever, investors that want to jump in on the AI race now, hoping that Nvidia will reach even higher highs, might be disappointed.\n\n\"Bears have little to chew upon, barring a meteoric share price rise, a premium valuation and seemingly universal enthusiasm for the stock. The $2.3tn market capitalisation equates to around 40 times this year\u2019s earnings (when the S&P 500 (^GSPC) trades on around 21-22 times, according to research from S&P Global and Capital IQ) and 20 times forecast annual sales,\" they added.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, Nvidia is leading the race in the AI \"gold rush\" and a survey revealed that the stock is rivalling gold (GC=F) as a possible hedge against inflation.\n\nGold is still seen as the best safeguard against the risk of rising prices, according to 46% of survey participants. But nearly a third said the tech mega caps are their first pick for the role.\n\nNvidia's chief Jenson Huang received a 60% pay bump in the corporation's fiscal 2024 on the back of a massive rally in the share price.\n\nHuang's package swelled to $34.16m versus $21.35m in the prior year. This was comprised of an unchanged base salary of $996,515, stock awards of $26.67m, non-equity incentive compensation of $4m and all other compensation of $2.494m.\"\n\nMarks & Spencer (MKS.L) \u2014 Reports on Wednesday 22 May\n\n\u200b\u200bInvestors expect Marks & Spencer\u2019s upcoming full year earnings to show an ongoing recovery for the British retailer.\n\nAnalysts have nudged up the consensus underlying pre-tax profit forecast for the year to March 2024 to \u00a3653m, compared to the range of \u00a3550m to \u00a3600m that had prevailed before the interims, according to AJ Bell.\n\n\"Shares in Marks & Spencer are trading very close to five-year highs, and they rank as the second-best performers within the ranks of the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) over the past 12 months. However, the share price is almost unchanged in 2024 and that slight loss of momentum may reflect, bottom up, management\u2019s efforts to keep a lid on earnings forecasts and, top down, the delay on the long-awaited interest cuts from the Bank of England,\" the investment platform analysts said.\n\nAdding to the positive sentiment surrounding M&S shares is the recent bullish stance taken by several brokers. Last month, both JPMorgan and Jefferies upgraded the stock to the equivalent of \"buy\" ratings.\n\n\"Such broker upgrades often serve as a positive factor for a stock's performance, as they can influence investor sentiment and attract additional demand,\" Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, wrote.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the dividend forecast stands at 6.2p, representing a yield of 2.3% at the current share price.\n\n\"Notably, this dividend forecast is nearly double the figure for the previous year ended 31 March. With dividends on the rise, M&S could potentially attract a new set of investors seeking passive income streams,\" he added.\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR) \u2014 Reports on Monday 20 May\n\nLow-budget airlines benefited from Easter falling early this year and investors would be keen to see if the Boeing (BA) delivery delays will impact Ryanair's results.\n\nAnalysts expect revenue to have jumped 24% in the year ended 31 March, overcoming delayed Boeing deliveries and issues with third-party online travel agents.\n\nHowever, CEO Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s recent warning that summer ticket prices are not rising as much as expected sent chills through the sector.\n\nAnnual adjusted net income is seen up 33%, although the net loss probably swelled in the fourth quarter, seasonally the company\u2019s weakest, consensus shows, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\u200bLSEG Refinitiv data shows a consensus analyst rating of \"buy\" for Ryanair with six strong buy, 14 buy and one hold \u2014 and a mean of estimates suggesting a long-term price target of \u20ac25.60 for the share, roughly 34% higher than the current price.\n\nRead more: Eurozone interest rate cut expectations rise as inflation hits 2.4% in April\n\n\u200b\"Ryanair has taken measures to expand its fleet to 536 aircraft as of September 2023 to meet improving travel demand. However, the budget carrier was impacted by over 800 flight cancellations in February due to conflicts between Israel and Gaza,\" Axel Rudolph, market analyst at IG, wrote.\n\n\u200b\"As travel continues recovering from pandemic disruptions, easyJet (EZJ.L) and Ryanair's ability to contain costs and execute on growth plans will be key for sustaining profitability momentum,\" he added.\n\nDeutsche Bank has warned of another tough year for the European airline industry, but pointed to some positive news for the near term.\n\nUK inflation \u2014Wednesday 22 May\n\nNot a stock, but definitely market moving data that investors will need to watch out for \u2014 the latest UK inflation figures coming out.\n\nThe market's expectation is that headline inflation eased to 2.7% in April and that core inflation retreated to 3.6%.\n\n\"If correct, this should increase the chances of a rate cut in June,\" Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IUG, wrote.\n\nThe consumer prices index dropped to a two and a half-year low of 3.2% in March, according to the Office for National Statistics, which was down from 3.4% the previous month but higher than economists\u2019 forecasts of 3.1%.\n\nCore inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, dropped to 4.2% in March from 4.5% in the previous month. Analysts expected a drop to 4.1%.\n\n\"Much hinges on the April CPI data due later in May, which is when we\u2019ll see the results of the annual contract-linked price rises that typically take place at the start of the year. Our rough estimates suggest 40% of the services inflation basket is affected by these annual price hikes to some degree, and last year\u2019s data release was much stronger than expected, prompting the single biggest daily increase in two-year swap rates in 2023 as a whole,\" ING wrote.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) will release the latest figures this Wednesday.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 20 May\n\nBig Yellow (BYG.L)\n\nKainos (KNOS.L)\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW)\n\nZoom Video Communications (ZM)\n\nTuesday 21 May\n\nCranswick (CWK.L)\n\nPennon (PNN.L)\n\nAssura (AGR.L)\n\nSSP (SSPG.L)\n\nGreencore (GNC.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nKingfisher (KGF.L)\n\nDowlais (DWL.L)\n\nSony (SONY)\n\nAsahi (2502.T)\n\nRakuten (5838.T)\n\nSamsonite (SMSEY)\n\nTencent (0700.HK)\n\nGenerali (G.MI)\n\nLowe\u2019s (LOW)\n\nAutoZone (AZO)\n\nAmer Sports (AS)\n\nMacy\u2019s (M)\n\nUrban Outfitters (URBN)\n\nWednesday 22 May\n\nSSE (SSE.L)\n\nRS Group (RS1.L)\n\nBritish Land (BLND.L)\n\nIntegrafin (IHP.L)\n\nCoats (COA.L)\n\nXiaomi (1810.HK)\n\nSoitec (SOI.PA)\n\nAnalog Devices (ADI)\n\nTarget (TGT)\n\nSnowflake (SNOW)\n\nThursday 23 May\n\nNational Grid (NG.L)\n\nJohnson Matthey (JMAT.L)\n\nInternational Distribution Services (IDS.L)\n\nTate & Lyle (TATE.L)\n\nWizz Air (WIZZ.L)\n\nQinetiQ (QQ.L)\n\nBloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L)\n\nGreat Portland Estates (GPE.L)\n\nAviva (AV.L)\n\nPetershill Partners (PHLL.L)\n\nHill & Smith (HILS.L)\n\nMeituan (3690.HK)\n\nLenovo (0992.HK)\n\nMedtronic (MDT)\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR)\n\nRalph Lauren (RL)\n\nPolestar (PSNY)\n\nFriday 24 May\n\nIntertek (ITRK.L)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nWatch: Nvidia: One thing this strategist thinks could threaten growth<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-impacting-q1-earnings-214124185.html\\\">Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative technology,</a> with tech giants increasingly investing in its development.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Prosus NV and Naspers Ltd. have named the first new chief executive officer since the South African-Dutch tech group split almost five years ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChina Attempts to End Property Crisis With Broad Rescue Package With a BlackRock CEO, $9 Trillion Vanguard Braces for Turbulence US Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US \u2018Containment\u2019 Jamie Dimon Sees \u2018Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us\u2019\n\nFabricio Bloisi, 47, will become CEO in July, taking over from Bob van Dijk who resigned in September, the companies said in a statement on Friday. Interim CEO Ervin Tu becomes president and chief investment officer. Bloisi was previously the head of the group\u2019s iFood business.\n\nCape Town-headquartered Naspers is one of the biggest technology investors globally and listed its internet unit, Prosus, in Amsterdam five years ago - but kept a single CEO across both entities. Bloisi will have to contend with the legacy of a complicated business structure that stumped van Dijk, including the group\u2019s investment in Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., and a market environment that\u2019s been tough on some of the group\u2019s dozens of internet businesses.\n\nBloisi leads one of the group\u2019s success stories in iFood, a Brazilian food delivery operator he wrapped into his Movile e-commerce business. Now fully owned by Prosus, the company is the biggest online food delivery company in Brazil and fulfills 96 million orders a month.\n\n\u201cFabricio has established iFood as one of the most innovative food delivery companies in the world,\u201d Chairman Koos Bekker said. \u201cHe has a combination of vision, deep operational experience and strong discipline. It is this skill set which the board believes make him the right person to now lead us.\u201d\n\nOne legacy complication for Bloisi is the impact of the group\u2019s blockbuster early-stage investment in Tencent in 2001 for $34 million.\n\nSince then, the Chinese company\u2019s growth has exploded, with the value of the holding distorting the value of the rest of the business. The group has tried a number of maneuvers to grapple with this, including selling down some of its stake in Tencent to buy back its own shares. So far, the move has created about $33 billion in value over the last 18 months, said Bloisi on a shareholder call.\n\nVan Dijk stepped down last year, shortly after unwinding a complicated cross-shareholding structure he\u2019d set up between Prosus and Naspers to try to address some of the distorting effect of the Tencent stake. Van Dijk became Naspers CEO in 2014 and had headed Prosus since its 2019 listing.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Prosus CEO Van Dijk Resigns After Simplifying Ownership\n\n\u201cFabricio is a strong operator with an entrepreneurial spirit, as he grew a 20 person startup into one of the most successful Brazilian tech stories to date,\u201d Jefferies analyst Sebastian Patulea said in a note to investors on Friday. \u201cHowever, we argue that his outstanding skills as an owner-operator are unlikely to be fully utilized at the helm of Prosus (given investments in both public and private companies would have their own operators), and we would have preferred a capital allocator with a track record in either private or public market expertise at the helm of Prosus.\u201d\n\nProsus shares were down 2.7% on Friday in Amsterdam, while Naspers was trading 2.9% lower in Johannesburg at 12.15 p.m.\n\nThe group\u2019s strategic goals remain unchanged, and it is on target to deliver a consolidated e-commerce trading profit during the second half of the fiscal year, the companies said. Prosus and Naspers have made big bets in delivery in recent years, with assets also including India\u2019s Swiggy, Germany\u2019s Delivery Hero SE and Germany\u2019s Flink.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s new CEO is likely to be very hands-on with the company\u2019s food delivery assets (beyond iFood), pushing for better execution and eventually a successful IPO in the long term to generate shareholder value,\u201d said JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Marcus Diebel in a note. \u201cWe also see a chance for a stronger alignment of iFood and Delivery Hero\u2019s Latin American food delivery operations.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s other sectors include classified advertising, payments and fintech.\n\nBloisi said he would move from Brazil to Amsterdam to take on the new position as group CEO, while remaining the chairman of iFood.\n\n--With assistance from Khuleko Siwele and Henry Ren.\n\n(Updates with additional details on Bloisi, analyst comment from third paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNeuralink\u2019s First Patient: \u2018It Blows My Mind So Much\u2019 How the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives Milei Targets Labor Law That\u2019s Set to Hand Banker $10 Million Severance The DNA Test Delusion Europe\u2019s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The global gaming market has grown significantly, driven by technological advancements, increased accessibility and the rise of trends like the metaverse and e-sports. Industry reports estimate the market will grow from $272.86 billion in 2024 to $426.02 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate, otherwise known as CAGR, of 9.32%.\n\nMeanwhile, the performance of gaming stocks mostly hinges on the ability to innovate, retain users and capitalize on emerging trends. As with all long-term investments, potential investors should keep a close eye on a given gaming company\u2019s financials, user metrics, as well as strategic moves. With that information, here are three gaming stocks to buy in the second quarter.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY) gaming stocks, Close up photo of arcade game buttons and toggle in arcade\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/iChzigo\n\nAmong the gaming stocks to buy, Japan-based Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) stands out for its long-standing history and enduring popularity. Founded in 1889, Nintendo has evolved from a playing card company to a global leader in video game platforms and mobile applications, known for its innovative consoles and iconic characters. Many readers are likely to be familiar with its franchises such as Super Mario, Zelda and Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNintendo operates primarily through its flagship product, the Nintendo Switch platform, which accounts for more than 90% of revenues. The gaming company also has revenue from mobile, intellectual property and traditional playing cards.\n\nYet, despite a diverse product range, the Nintendo Switch remains the cornerstone of Nintendo\u2019s revenue generation.\n\nRecent financials for the full fiscal year ending March 2024 showed revenues of 1.67 trillion Japanese yen. This meant a 4.4% increase year-over-year, with ordinary income climbing 13.2% to 680.5 billion JPY. Over three-quarters of the sales came outside of Japan. With a net profit margin of over 29%, the company boasts impressive profitability margins.\n\nMeanwhile, management forecasts revenue to decrease to 1,350 billion JPY during fiscal year 2025. Nonetheless, the company plans to unveil the successor to the Nintendo Switch before March 2025. This milestone will arrive more than nine years after the initial launch of the Switch in March 2015.\n\nSo far in the year, NTDOY stock has advanced over 13.43% the past month. Shares are changing hands at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.55x earnings and a price-to-sales ratio of 5.84x. These metrics potentially reflect investor confidence in Nintendo\u2019s ability to maintain its market strength, especially with the upcoming console update.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you are looking for a gaming company with a niche in combining creativity with online collaboration, then Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) deserves your attention among the lists of gaming stocks to buy. Over the platform, users create and explore 3D digital worlds. Online gamers point out that Roblox\u2019s approach has democratized game development while enriching the platform\u2019s offerings.\n\nCurrently, Roblox boasts a market capitalization of approximately $21 billion. According to recent earnings results, revenue for the quarter was $801.3 million, up 22% YOY.\n\nIn terms of bookings, which represent the sales of virtual goods on the platform, there was also a notable increase by 19% to reach $923.8 million. The gaming company generates revenue primarily through its virtual currency, Robux.\n\nOne of the most widely watched indicators of Roblox\u2019s results is its user engagement metrics. The platform\u2019s daily active users reached 77.7 million by the end of March, up 17.55% from the previous quarter. In other words, the platform has growing appeal among users.\n\nMoreover, the total hours engaged on the platform surged to 16.7 billion in the first quarter of the year, up by over 15% from the previous quarter.\n\nDespite the strong growth of the platform, the gaming stock has lost approximately 22% year-to-date. Yet the P/S ratio of 6.99x highlights that Roblox shares still command a premium valuation.\n\nAs the metaverse trend gains traction worldwide, Roblox\u2019s position as a user-generated content platform is likely to become even more prominent. Readers watching developments in the broader metaverse space may regard declines below the $40 level as a better entry point into RBLX stock.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nFounded in 1998 and headquartered in Shenzhen, the conglomerate Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has evolved from a regional tech company into a global powerhouse. The company has been involved in various sectors including gaming, social media and fintech. Thus, for investors eyeing the gaming stocks to buy, TCEHY may offer a viable opportunity.\n\nTencent\u2019s financial health is robust. On May 14, management of the Chinese group released financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Total revenue of $22.5 billion was up 6% over the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, operating margin went up to 37% from 30% a year ago.\n\nAnalysts highlight that Tencent has been showing promising growth, particularly in its gaming sector. The company reported a 26% year-over-year growth in advertising revenue, driven by enhanced engagement and artificial intelligence-powered ad targeting.\n\nMeanwhile, the fintech and business services segment is also growing, bolstered by wealth management services and increased technology service fees.\n\nSince January, TCEHY has advanced 36%. Meanwhile, the shares are trading at a valuation of about 31.06 times forward earnings. In recent weeks, many Chinese stock market heavyweights, including Tencent, have been buying back their shares. If this trend continues, the future might be even brighter for TCEHY stock investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "Chinese video gaming and social media giant Tencent Holdings launched an upgraded version of its large language model (LLM) with text-to-image generation that is open source for enterprises and individuals.\n\nThe eight-month-old Hunyuan large language foundation model developed by Tencent underwent a major upgrade earlier this year, which enhanced its overall performance by 20 per cent compared with the previous version, according to a statement posted on Tuesday on the official WeChat account of Tencent Cloud, the company's cloud-computing services arm.\n\nTencent said the latest text-to-image function employs the DiT model architecture, which is also used by OpenAI's text-to-video tool Sora. The company added that its primary database is in Chinese, enabling the tool to effectively and accurately understand Chinese-language commands.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe complete source code of its text-to-image LLM has been released on US open-source platforms Hugging Face and Github \"to benefit the industry as a whole and build an open source ecosystem for next-generation vision generation\", according to the statement.\n\nThat means both individuals and enterprises can access the program's code and modify or share its design, fix broken links, or scale up its capabilities.\n\nSince launching Hunyuan last September, Tencent has integrated its LLM into the company's various business units, including Tencent Cloud, Tencent Games and super app WeChat. The company said the AI-powered tool has also been provided to over 20 media outlets and advertising firms to facilitate their work.\n\nThe launch of the upgraded version came a day after Microsoft-backed OpenAI unveiled its newest GPT model, GPT-4o, which is capable of natural human-computer interaction across text, image, video, and audio.\n\nOpen-source technologies have played an important role in facilitating China's ability to improve its LLMs and catch up with OpenAI's innovative generative AI tools.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post, has also taken an aggressive move to give third-party developers access to its models after the e-commerce giant launched its self-developed Tongyi Qianwen, or Qwen, LLM last year.\n\nTencent launched its Hunyuan AI model during the Global Digital Ecosystem Summit in Shenzhen, September 7, 2023: Photo: Handout alt=Tencent launched its Hunyuan AI model during the Global Digital Ecosystem Summit in Shenzhen, September 7, 2023: Photo: Handout>\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba Cloud, the company's cloud-computing unit, has provided access to 76 Qwen text generation models on ModelScope and Hugging Face.\n\nIt includes the 72-billion-parameter and 1.8-billion-parameter versions of its LLM. It also freely made available another model that understands audio.\n\nBoth Tencent and Alibaba reported better-than-expected profits in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nShenzhen-based Tencent reported a 62 per cent jump to 41.9 billion yuan (US$5.8 billion) in the first quarter, fuelled by strong advertising revenue, marking its first quarterly profit growth since last June.\n\nAlibaba reported a 10 per cent increase in profit to 79.7 billion yuan in the financial year through to the end of March, marking its most profitable year since 2021.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Two of China's largest technology companies beat their earnings forecasts, as Chinese consumers spent more online on retail goods and games, a harbinger of improving corporate profits in the nation's post-pandemic economy.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, reported a 10-per cent jump in net profit, its biggest annual earnings growth since 2021, as its revenue beat analysts' forecasts in the financial year that ended on March 31.\n\nNet profit at Tencent Holdings, the world's largest games publisher, jumped by 62 per cent in the first quarter, comfortably beating the consensus forecast compiled by Bloomberg, while sales rose 6 per cent.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nStrong financial results by the two companies - with more than 300,000 staff between them - are the touchstones of the growth in corporate earnings and economy that global investors are looking for, as they debate whether China's post-pandemic recovery was a flash in the pan.\n\nThe outlook for profitability among Chinese companies looks bright because China's economic growth is showing signs of stabilising after emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic, UBS said on May 8.\n\nThat is a relief for investors, helping them recover from the 4-per cent average decline in first-quarter net income among the 5,000 companies listed on the stock exchanges of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to UBS. Earnings had fallen earlier because consumers had refrained from spending amid a property slump.\n\n\"From a macro perspective, recent property sales and new starts have yet to hit bottom, while overall earnings remained pressured amid subdued demand in the first quarter,\" said Meng Lei, a strategist at UBS in Shanghai. \"Looking ahead, earnings are set to pick up as property activity stabilises and inflation recovery fuels household income and consumer spending growth.\"\n\nUBS was among the global investment banks and brokers that dialled down their scepticism about China's growth prospects in recent months, joining Goldman Sachs and BNP in saying that they are now \"positive\" on the world's second-largest economy. HSBC switched its position on China's equities from \"underweight\" to \"neutral.\"\n\nChina's economy expanded by 5.3 per cent in the first three months, at a faster pace than the previous quarter, according to official data.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe state of retail sales is of particular importance to economists and China watchers, as spending by consumers is key to restarting the country's economic growth engine. Sales growth slowed to 3.1 per cent in March, as consumers eschewed big ticket purchases such as residential property and vehicles.\n\nHere, the corporate earnings by Alibaba and Tencent are important indicators. Alibaba, which operates Taobao and Tmall Marketplace, sells everything from personal and household goods to fresh produce, and even conducts land and ownership auctions for companies. Tencent earned 180 billion yuan last year, or about 30 per cent of its group revenue, from the world's largest catalogue of mobile games, including such blockbusters as Honour of Kings and PUBG Mobile.\n\nImproved corporate earnings are crucial to the upwards momentum in Chinese stocks listed on the mainland, Hong Kong and New York, analysts said.\n\n\"We are seeing a resurgence in investor interest in Chinese stocks, including the internet industry, and Tencent is poised to be a top choice for larger funds due to its decent profit growth,\" said Shawn Yang, a senior analyst at Arete Research.\n\nChina's benchmark CSI 300 Index has risen 15 per cent from its February low after a slew of state measures such as direct stock purchases and restrictions on short selling. Overseas investors snapped up yuan-traded stocks for a third consecutive month in March largely because of improving sentiment and recalibration of portfolios by global money managers.\n\nTencent is the largest stock on Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index, which crossed the 19,000-level this week, capping a 27.8-per cent rally from January's low to return to a bull market. Tencent's stock has gained 45.6 per cent in the same period.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "HONG KONG, May 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Tencent Holdings Limited (HKEX: 00700 (HKD Counter) and 80700 (RMB Counter), \"Tencent\" or the \"Company\"), a world-leading Internet and technology company in China, today announced the unaudited consolidated results for the first quarter (\"1Q2024\") ended Mar 31, 2024.\n\nMr. Ma Huateng, Chairman and CEO of Tencent, said, \"During the first quarter of 2024, several of our leading games in China and internationally started to benefit from team reorganisations we put in place, resulting in an increase in games gross receipts and creating a foundation for our games revenue to resume growth in future quarters. We continue to cultivate high quality revenue streams including advertising in Video Accounts and Weixin Search, Mini Games platform service fees, and eCommerce technology service fees, contributing to our gross and operating profit growth outpacing our revenue growth. Executing on our commitment to return excess capital to shareholders, we stepped up our buyback plan, and are on track to repurchase over HKD100 billion of our shares in 2024, as well as paying an increased dividend, while investing in AI technology, platform enhancements and high production value content.\"\n\n1Q2024 Financial Highlights\n\nRevenues: +6% YoY; gross profit: +23% YoY; non-IFRS[1] operating profit*: +30% YoY; non-IFRS profit attributable to equity holders of the Company: +54% YoY\n\nTotal revenues were RMB159.5 billion (USD22.5 billion[2]), up 6% over the first quarter of 2023 (\"YoY\").

During the first quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 51.0 million shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for a consideration of approximately HKD14.8 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\n1Q24 Business Review and Outlook\n\nVideo Accounts' total user time spent increased over 80% year-on-year. We strengthened Video Accounts' live streaming eCommerce ecosystem by diversifying merchandise categories and enabling more content creators to monetise through eCommerce activities. Mini Programs' total user time spent increased over 20% year-on-year. Daily activations for non-game Mini Programs grew at a double-digit rate year-on-year while gross receipts for Mini Games grew 30% year-on-year. Tencent Video released several popular self-commissioned drama series and animated series, such as Blossoms Shanghai, The Hunter and Perfect World Season 4, driving an 8% year-on-year increase in our long-form video subscriptions to 116 million[4]. Tencent Music strengthened collaboration with Tencent Video and released an original soundtrack of a popular drama series, The Legend of Shen Li. Music subscriptions increased 20% year-on-year to 114 million[5]. Our two flagship domestic games, Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite, registered year-on-year growth in gross receipts in March 2024, as our new monetisation cadence and enhanced content design started to yield results. Several domestic games attained record high gross receipts during the quarter, including Fight of the Golden Spatula, CrossFire Mobile and Arena Breakout. Supercell's games achieved increases in usage and gross receipts; Brawl Stars DAU more than doubled year-on-year and gross receipts more than quadrupled year-on-year internationally. We upgraded our advertising technology platform to help advertisers establish advertising campaigns more effectively, and made generative AI-powered advertising creation tools available to all advertisers. We achieved rapid increases in number of users and average fund investments per user for our wealth management business, which is primarily engaged in distribution of low-risk money market funds. Domestic and international clients, especially from the media, entertainment and live streaming industries, increasingly adopted our integrated audio and video cloud solution, Tencent Cloud Media Services. IDC recognised Tencent Cloud Media Services as the market leader in China for the sixth consecutive year[6].\n\n[1] Non-IFRS adjustments excludes share-based compensation, M&A related impact such as net (gains)/losses from investee companies, amortisation of intangible assets, impairment provisions/(reversals), SSV & CPP, income tax effects and others [2] Figures stated in USD are based on USD1 to RMB7.0950 [3] Including those held via special purpose vehicles, on an attributable basis [4] The average daily number of subscriptions for 1Q2024 [5] The average number of subscriptions as of the last day of each month during 1Q2024 [6] Measured by Media Services revenue per IDC, 2018-2023\n\nOperating Metrics\n\nAs at\n\n31 March\r\n2024 As at\n\n31 March\n\n2023 Year-\n\non-year\n\nchange As at\n\n31 December\n\n2023 Quarter-on-\r\nquarter\n\nchange (in millions, unless specified) Combined MAU of\n\nWeixin and WeChat 1,359 1,319 3\u00a0% 1,343 1\u00a0% Mobile device MAU of QQ 553 597 -7\u00a0% 554 -0.2\u00a0% Fee-based VAS registered\n\nsubscriptions# 260 233 12\u00a0% 244 7\u00a0% # Adjusted as the average daily number of subscriptions during the quarter\n\n1Q24 Management Discussion and Analysis\n\nRevenues from VAS decreased by 0.9% year-on-year to RMB78.6 billion for the first quarter of 2024. International Games gross receipts rose 34% year-on-year, due to resurgent popularity for Supercell's games, in particular Brawl Stars, and user and gross receipts growth from PUBG Mobile. International Games revenues were up a lesser 3% year-on-year to RMB13.6 billion (stable year-on-year on a constant currency basis) due to the lengthy revenue deferral cycle for Supercell's games. Domestic Games gross receipts returned to year-on-year growth, increasing by 3%, but Domestic Games revenues declined by 2% year-on-year to RMB34.5 billion due to revenue deferral. By title, revenue from Honour of Kings declined year-on-year against a high base from the Chinese New Year period last year, and revenue from Peacekeeper Elite declined year-on-year due to weak monetisable content in the second half of 2023. These declines were largely offset by contributions from recently launched games, including VALORANT and Lost Ark, alongside robust growth from Fight of the Golden Spatula. Social Networks revenues declined by 2% to RMB30.5 billion, reflecting increased revenues from music and long-form video subscriptions, Video Accounts live streaming services, and Mini Games platform service fees, versus decreased revenues from music-related and games-related live streaming services.\n\nRevenues from Online Advertising were RMB26.5 billion for the first quarter of 2024, up 26% year-on-year, driven by Video Accounts, Mini Programs, Official Accounts and Weixin Search, due to increased engagement and ongoing enhancement of our AI-powered advertising infrastructure. Advertising spending rose across all major categories except automotive, with notable growth from games, Internet services and consumer goods categories.\n\nRevenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 7% year-on-year to RMB52.3 billion for the first quarter of 2024. FinTech Services revenues grew at a single-digit rate, primarily due to moderated growth in offline consumption spending and a decrease in withdrawal fee revenue, while wealth management services revenues experienced robust growth. Business Services achieved a teens year-on-year revenue growth rate, driven by higher cloud services revenues and increased eCommerce technology service fees within Video Accounts.\n\nFor other detailed disclosure, please refer to our website https://www.tencent.com/en-us/investors.html, or follow us via Weixin Official Account (Weixin ID: Tencent_IR)\n\nAbout Tencent\n\nTencent uses technology to enrich the lives of Internet users.\n\nOur communication and social services, Weixin and QQ, connect users with each other and with digital content and services, both online and offline, making their lives more convenient.

        "title": "Tencent Beats Estimates After WeChat, Video Lift Ad Growth",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s revenue and earnings beat estimates after its TikTok-style video platform gained traction against ByteDance Ltd. and drove growth despite a faltering Chinese economic recovery.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind Macron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe Biden Adds Tariffs on Chinese Chips, Critical Minerals, EVs Five Under-the-Radar Billionaires Making Vast Fortunes in Modi's India Tesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk\u2019s Cuts\n\nRevenue for the three months ended March rose 6% to 159.5 billion yuan ($22 billion), compared with the 158.8 billion yuan average estimate. Net income also climbed a stronger-than-anticipated 62% after users spent 80% more time on WeChat\u2019s video accounts, a nod to efforts to wrest engagement from rival ByteDance. That helped drive a 26% rise in ad sales.\n\nStock in major shareholder Prosus NV \u2014 a proxy for Tencent\u2019s stock after trading hours \u2014 rose 2.9%. China\u2019s most valuable company is increasingly relying on WeChat to rejuvenate its sprawling internet empire at a time of economic difficulties. The country\u2019s go-to everything app has stepped up monetization through advertising, e-commerce sales, and in-game purchases, offsetting weakness across other segments. Such higher-margin revenue could buy Tencent time as it seeks its next big breakthrough in areas like gaming and generative AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest economy has struggled post-pandemic. Chinese consumers remain cautious during a property meltdown and persistent youth unemployment, while the economy is slipping deeper into deflation, reflecting anemic domestic demand. Beijing\u2019s leaders are slated to hold a long-delayed conclave in July, when new policies to stimulate the economy are expected.\n\nBut Tencent also has a few internal issues to sort out.\n\nOnce its bread and butter, the games division remains in search of its next big hit, after years of regulatory tightening that cut play times and slowed development. Its new mobile release Dream Star hasn\u2019t yet unseated NetEase Inc. as the leader in the fast-growing genre of party royale games \u2014 casual titles intended for group play. Tencent fast-tracked the Chinese debut of Dungeon & Fighter Mobile to this month, but the hack-and-slash game will then have to contend with rival titles from ByteDance and Genshin Impact studio Mihoyo.\n\nBeyond China, Tencent\u2019s Supercell will soon launch its first new game in five years. Before that, its biggest revenue driver was an updated version of the aging mainstay Brawl Stars.\n\nStory continues\n\nValue-added services \u2014 a segment that largely comprises gaming revenue \u2014 slid in the quarter even as ads and fintech services grew. But the company disclosed gross gaming receipts for the first time in years \u2014 a more precise measure of the amount that gamers are spending Tencent said grew in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nTencent\u2019s studios \u201cmight have taken their foot off the pedal when it comes to innovation\u201d after years free from intense scrutiny on revenue and profit, Morningstar analyst Ivan Su wrote in a note before the results. \u201cIt seems a wave of change is on the horizon.\u201d\n\nRead More: Tencent, Alibaba Earnings Are Key to Longer China Stock Rally\n\nWeChat sits at the heart of Tencent\u2019s effort to tap its massive user traffic for what it calls high-quality growth. The super-app\u2019s foray into mini-videos and live shopping helps diversify revenue streams beyond gaming and improve margins across the board, after the company let go of non-core businesses in past years.\n\nTencent\u2019s cloud division is seeking to reach break-even, and its payment arm won a regulatory nod in March to boost its registered capital, potentially unlocking a new stream of lucrative revenue through consumer loans. Both units will likely help Tencent\u2019s earnings outpace sales growth in coming quarters. Gross margin rose to 53%, the highest since 2016.\n\nLonger run, Tencent joins much of the world\u2019s biggest internet conglomerates in exploring the potential of generative AI. Its large language model, Hunyuan, is now integrated with a suite of products including search and online marketing. Like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the WeChat operator has also made multiple bets on domestic AI model startups, helping mint new unicorns including Baichuan and Minimax.\n\nTencent\u2019s shares have surged roughly 30% so far this year, far outpacing the Hang Seng Tech Index. In March, the company announced a plan to more than double its stock buyback program to at least $12.8 billion this year, another sign of maturity in a Chinese tech sector that once led the nation in growth. The step-up could help ease the selling pressure by Tencent\u2019s biggest shareholder Prosus NV, which is paring its stake in Tencent to fund its own buyback.\n\n--With assistance from Sarah Zheng, Jane Zhang, Sabrina Mao, Debby Wu and Peter Elstrom.\n\n(Updates with shares from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nKids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits How the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia\u2019s Shifting Exports \u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Let\u2019s explore!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) someone using the Facebook (FB stock) app on their phone in front of a laptop that also has the Facebook webpage on it\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is up 37% in 2024, but analysts remain bullish. 43 analysts support a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating, with 39 recommending a \u201cBuy.\u201d The stock\u2019s price target averages approximately $531, which represents an almost 12% upside potential from its list price of around $475.\n\nLlama 3-powered Meta AI illustrates how ongoing innovation boosts the upside. Its flexibility allows the clever AI tool to serve users on Meta\u2019s platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, in English in over a dozen countries.\n\nMeta is also letting third-party developers and hardware specialists use its Meta Quest operating system to make mixed-reality apps more accessible.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in the lead-up to the 2024 United States presidential election, Meta has detailed its policies to secure polls on various platforms and avoid any costly legal battles. This includes a big fact-checking network, strict ad constraints, significant security investment and new guidelines that require advertisers to disclose if they employ AI for social or political advertising\n\nFinally, Meta\u2019s last earnings report showed strong beats on the top and bottom lines. Annual first-quarter revenue rose 27% to $36.46 billion, and net income of $12.37 billion was more than twice the year before, but the price plunged 10% after the results on weak guidance, opening an attractive entry point for investors looking for social media stocks to buy.\n\nBumble (BMBL) The logo for Bumble (BMBL) is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nBumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) is undergoing a transformation. Lidiane Jones is now CEO of Bumble, complimenting a number of new hires, such as David Ard as Chief People Officer, Ali Rayl as Chief Product Officer, Antoine Leblond as Chief Technology Officer and Selby Drummond as Chief Marketing Officer.\n\nThe shakeup at the top is working if you look at the latest financials; Bumble\u2019s first-quarter sales rose 10.2% to $267.8 million, above Wall Street\u2019s prediction of $265.5 million. The firm also announced above-expected profits. Earnings per share were 19 cents, vs 7 cents predicted.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter, 4 million consumers paid for Bumble\u2019s applications, up from 3.5 million last year. Some applications include Bumble, Badoo and Fruitz. Bumble uses community-based marketing to acquire users; it entails arranging events and engaging ambassadors who share the brand\u2019s values to attract new users.\n\nBumble is also recognizing 2024 dating trends like \u201cshared values,\u201d and \u201crebelling against constant improvement rhetoric\u201d to develop the app. Additionally, Bumble may reconsider its distinguishing trait of women making the first move to empower users. AI-enhanced user security and profile improvements are further additions.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) hands holding smartphone with social media icons floating above it. brick wall background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nChinese conglomerate Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) holds some of the biggest social media apps in the country, with Weibo alone reporting 598 million monthly active users in December, up 11 million sequentially. But the jewel in TCEHY\u2019s social media crown is WeChat, which boasts 1.3 billion monthly active users up from just 355 million users in Q4 2013.\n\nOver and above that, the best part about investing in TCEHY is that you gain access to several important business lines with one stock. Its premium position in China and innovation in new areas, such as Tencent Hunyuan, a foundation model for AI, gives it a premium position among social media stocks to buy, illustrated by four consecutive earnings beats.\n\nTencent is also active in terms of industry partnership. It\u2019s collaborating with Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY), two big Japanese companies, to improve AI use in the car industry.\n\nIn addition, Tencent has listed quantum computing, AI-driven industry growth, sustainable computing and other things as some of the top ten technological trends for 2024. These trends show Tencent\u2019s view of the future of technology and how it will affect different fields and daily life.\n\nThe stock last closed at $47.63, perilously close to its 52-week high of $47.75, but the company\u2019s decision to raise its dividend 42% and more than double its share repurchase commitment in 2024 more than offsets the bearish thesis.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Burberry, Vodafone, BT and Walmart",
        "content": "Luxury goods brand Burberry presents results this Wednesday. Above, British model Cara Delevingne at a Burberry show in Kensington Gore, west London.  (Joel Ryan, Associated Press)\n\nEarnings season continues, and investors have some high expectations for some of the major companies reporting next week such as Vodafone and Burberry.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nVodafone (VOD.L) \u2013 Reports on Tuesday 14 May\n\nVodafone shares have struggled and they rank among the worst performing FTSE 100 names over the past 5 years. So why would investors keep tabs on the telecoms operator when it presents its full-year results next Tuesday?\n\nChief executive Margherita Della Valle took the helm in January 2023 and last May launched a major overhaul which has seen the company try to merge its UK assets with those of Three and sell both its Italian and Spanish operations in two deals with a combined value of \u20ac12bn (\u00a313bn, .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Vodafone\u2019s recent third-quarter results provided some optimism for investors to cling to, but wider issues remain,\u201d Matt Britzman, equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\nInvestors should focus on the timing on the sale of the Spanish and Italian businesses and any updates on the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s investigation into the proposed merger of Vodafone\u2019s UK assets with those of Three.\n\n\u201cThe regulator, thus far, does not seem to welcome the plan. Margherita Della Valle hopes these deals will complete the reorganisation that she targeted back in May 2023 and will leave the company with a new, five-pronged reporting structure, of Germany, UK, Other Europe, Turkey and Africa,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\n\u201cAlso watch out for any comment on the proposed \u20ac2bn share buybacks after completion of each of the Spanish and Italian deals,\u201d they noted.\n\nOver the past year, Vodafone shares rank 92nd within the FTSE 100. In terms of share price change and over the past five years, they rank 93rd, thanks to a fall of more than 50%, according to AJ Bell.\n\nBurberry (BRBY.L) \u2013 Reports on Wednesday 15 May\n\nLuxury goods group Burberry will tell investors if London is still missing out to Paris and Milan as a tourist destination for high-spending shoppers as it presents its full-year results on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAJ Bell tells us that analysts currently expect total sales of \u00a32.9bn, a 1% drop on a constant currency basis, and an adjusted operating profit of around \u00a3405mn.\n\nThat is with a forecast \u00a3120m hit to sales and a \u00a360m hit to profits from currency movements. Adjust for that and operating profit is seen reaching \u00a3465mn for a margin of 15.8%.\n\n\u201cBurberry\u2019s shares have more than halved in the past year, to leave them back near the lows plumbed during the early stages of the pandemic in 2020 (although the \u00a310 mark provided support then, as it did in 2016 and 2012, so it will be interesting to see if that level is breached or holds this time around),\u201d Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth wrote.\n\nInvestors should focus on comparing momentum in the third quarter compared to that shown earlier in the year. Any updates on the company\u2019s capital allocation policy will be of interest as analysts now expect Burberry to cut its total dividend to 52p a share from 61p a share.\n\nBT (BT-A.L) \u2013 Reports on Thursday 16 May\n\nBT shares are currently back at levels first seen in the immediate aftermath of the company\u2019s stock market flotation in late 1984 \u2014 when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and Nigel Lawson was chancellor of the exchequer.\n\nIncreased competition, regulation and debt leading to minimal profit progression, has lead to a sharp decline in the stock, as well as dividend cuts.\n\nNew boss Allison Kirkby reaffirmed full-year guidance, alongside the third-quarter update back in February, as Openreach continues to build out Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) to improve the nation\u2019s broadband infrastructure, and as EE adds business and retail customers alike.\n\nBT is expecting growth in both sales and adjusted EBITDA for the year to March 2024. Consensus forecasts are looking for 2.1% sales growth to \u00a320.9bn and a 2% increase in adjusted EBITDA to \u00a38.1bn, ahead of a 0.8% gain and 1.4% gain to \u00a321bn and \u00a38.3bn respectively in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe company also expects capital investment of \u00a35bn in the year to March, compared to \u00a35.3bn a year ago, and free cash flow of between \u00a31.0bn and \u00a31.2bn, down from \u00a31.3bn.\n\nAnalysts think capex will be flat and free cash flow up modestly in the coming year.\n\nNo change is expected in BT\u2019s annual dividend of 7.7p a share and the firm does not run a share buyback programme.\n\nWalmart (WMT) \u2014 Reports on Thursday 16 May\n\nWalmart will report earnings before the bell on Thursday and for the April-ended quarter analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect adjusted profit of 52 cents a share, up 6% year over year. Revenue is forecast to rise 4.5% to $159.2bn.\n\nDoug McMillon, president and chief executive officer, and John David Rainey, executive vice president and chief financial officer, will host a call on the day to discuss the results and answer questions.\n\nIt comes as holiday-quarter earnings and revenue for the January-ended quarter accelerated from the prior quarter, up 7% and 6%, respectively. Meanwhile, global e-commerce revenue increased 23% and topped $100bn. In the US alone, e-commerce revenue rose 17%.\n\nIt also recently announced plans to acquire smart TV maker Vizio for $2.3bn, or 11.50 a share, and said it would open or expand more than 150 stores in America over the next five years.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 13 May\n\nCerillion (CER.L)\n\nSoftbank (9434.T)\n\nSuzuki Motor (7269.T)\n\nBridgestone (5108.T)\n\nTencent Music (TME)\n\nFerrovial (FER.MC)\n\nHochtief (HOT.MU)\n\nTuesday 14 May\n\nFlutter Entertainment (FLTR.L)\n\nGreggs (GRG.L)\n\nVirgin Money UK (VMUK.L)\n\nCurrys (CURY.L)\n\nSony (SONY)\n\nTencent (0700.HK)\n\nAlibaba (BABA)\n\nBayer (BAYN.DE)\n\nHome Depot (HD)\n\nWednesday 15 May\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nExperian (EXPN.L)\n\nImperial Brands (IMB.L)\n\nJD (JD)\n\nCommerzbank (CBK.DE)\n\nTUI (TUI.L)\n\nUbisoft (UEN.DE)\n\nCisco (CSCO)\n\nThursday 16 May\n\nUnited Utilities (UU.L)\n\nPremier Foods (PFD.L)\n\neasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nBaidu (BIDU)\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT)\n\nUnder Armour (UAA)\n\nFriday 17 May\n\nLand Securities (LAND.L)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nWatch: Stocks are thankful for strong earnings season amid inflation<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI?p=%5EDJI&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^DJI</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC?p=%5EIXIC&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^IXIC</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=%5EGSPC&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^GSPC</a>) as inflation is anticipated to remain high.</p>\\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really that broadening out effect that we think is gonna take hold as we get deeper into this quarter,\u201d Freedman explains.

        "title": "Toyota's Blockbuster Report Amid The EV Slowdown Reflect Its Determination To Catch Up On Software",
        "content": "Toyota's Blockbuster Report Amid The EV Slowdown Reflect Its Determination To Catch Up On Software\n\nOn Wednesday, Toyota Motor Company (NYSE: TM) reported a blockbuster fourth quarter to end its fiscal year, achieving records from sales to profits. While late in the EV race and significantly behind Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Toyota\u2019s strength in hybrids came in handy as the EV hype cooled down. In late April, Toyota also revealed a partnership with Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC: TCEHY) in an effort to stay competitive. Besides using the help of Tencent to increase the appeal of its vehicles, Toyota is aware it needs a game change. But, such investments will weight on its near-term profits so the earnings guidance was not at all impressive.\n\nA Blockbuster Fourth Quarter And Fiscal Year\n\nFor the January-March quarter,\u00a0\u00a0Toyota reported that operating profit surged 78%. What\u2019s even impressive is that for the year, it totaled 5.35 trillion yen or about\u00a0$34.5 billion, which is the first time for a Japanese company to surpass 5 trillion yen. Also for the full fiscal year, Toyota recorded a record profit of 4.94 trillion yen, which amounts to about\u00a0$31.9 billion,\u00a0on revenue of 45.1 trillion yen. Global sales reached an all-time high as they surpassed 10.3 million units, fueled by a strong demand both in the home market, as well as North America and Europe. Hybrid sales alone rose 31% to 3.7 million units.\n\nA More Sober Fiscal Year Outlook\n\nUp to March 2025, Toyota guided for a 20% profit decline in with an operating profit of \u00a54.3 trillion which amounts $28 billion, down from earnings of \u00a55.3 trillion it reported for the fiscal year 2024. Chief executive Koji Sato emphasized that Toyota will be doing what is necessary to cement its positioning as it plans to invest \u00a51.7tn in\u00a0AI and EVs it classifies as 'growth areas'.\u00a0Toyota also announced its plans to buy back up to 3% of its shares worth \u00a51 trillion.\n\nToyota\u2019s journey of an automaker set to become a mobility company.\n\nSato\u2019s leadership has already shown results and the new CEO made it clear that Toyota will do whatever it takes to ensure growth, including the reshaping its hardware-focused business model to focus more on software that is integral component of the all-electric future of the industry. But, while its fiscal year 2024 report smashed its own forecast from February, Toyota opted for a more sober outlook for the fiscal year ahead. Blazing a trail in hybrids paid off this time, but Toyota is well aware that this is not the solution as it needs to get better in software in order to challenge Tesla and remain relevant in the all-electric era. Fortunately, although Toyota is far behind Tesla in the EV space, as well as it other EV peers, Toyota still managed to defend its title of the world\u2019s largest automaker by sales for the fourth consecutive year so its power should never be underestimated. After all, it teamed up with Tencent and\u00a0unveiled two battery EVs for the Chinese market at the recent Beijing auto show.\u00a0By pairing up with Tencent, Toyota will also get equipped for the AI arms race besides sharpening its EV competitive edge.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The bounceback in Chinese stocks from their multi-year lows risks running out of steam unless the nation\u2019s tech giants can deliver on their earnings next week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial Israel Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Short One Out of Every 24 New York City Residents Is Now a Millionaire Einhorn Says Markets Are \u2018Broken.\u2019 Here\u2019s What Data Shows\n\nIndex heavyweights Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. both publish results next Tuesday, followed by JD.com Inc. and Baidu Inc. two days later. Those four firms alone represent more than a quarter of the MSCI China gauge.\n\nThe earnings scorecards come at a crucial time for the nation\u2019s key stock gauges that recently entered a bull market but are still some 40%-to-60% below their highs set in early 2021. A key question is whether the rebound \u2014 driven in part by cheap valuations and a rotation away from Japan \u2014 is durable or will once again be punctured by disappointing results.\n\n\u201cIf we do see these earnings coming through, the momentum will carry on,\u201d said Sean Taylor, chief investment officer at Matthews Asia in Hong Kong. \u201cAt the moment, we have signs that earnings are being downgraded less.\u201d\n\nChinese tech companies are something of a bellwether for the nation\u2019s entire stock market as they have tentacles stretching through the economy from their online sales, advertising and mobile games. The rebound in their shares \u2013 mainly due to the renewed interest from global funds in China\u2019s biggest and most liquid stocks \u2013 faces an earnings test as many are now technically overbought.\n\nTencent is expected to report a 6% increase in revenue for the quarter through March, while Alibaba\u2019s sales are forecast to rise by 5.6%, according to average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe early earnings data haven\u2019t been entirely favorable. Chinese firms have so far delivered a \u201csizable miss\u201d in first-quarter results, though there\u2019s been a sequential improvement from the previous three months, Morgan Stanley said in a client note last week.\n\nMSCI China Index members that have already announced first-quarter numbers have recorded an average 3% decline in earnings per share from a year earlier, with real estate, utilities and materials firms the worst performers, JPMorgan Chase & Co. also said last week.\n\nThere\u2019s still room for optimism though as tech companies were some of the best performers last year in boosting profits. Forward earnings estimates for an MSCI Index of 100 Chinese tech firms climbed about 20% in 2023, even as forecasts declined for other industries, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe sector is also still relatively cheap even after the Hang Seng Tech Index\u2019s 13% gain since the end of March. While the forward price-to-earnings ratio has risen to 16 times, it\u2019s still below the one-year average of 18, and well short of the five-year mean of 26.5.\n\nTraders have been quick to jump on positive business developments. Tencent\u2019s shares have been boosted by news the company is set to release the long-awaited Chinese version of Nexon Co.\u2019s Dungeon & Fighter mobile game this month, a title that will help revamp its aging portfolio. The stock of Xiaomi Corp. climbed to a two-year high after the smartphone maker announced better-than-expected initial orders for a new electric vehicle.\n\nStill, investors say they need to see sales growth to add to their conviction toward tech. Results from both Tencent and Alibaba missed analysts\u2019 estimates for the fourth quarter, and there\u2019s concern about China\u2019s disappointing retail-sales data published last month.\n\n\u201cThe overall backdrop of the internet industry hasn\u2019t been consistently strong,\u201d said Vivian Lin Thurston, a fund manager at William Blair Investment Management in Chicago. E-commerce firms, as a proxy for China\u2019s overall retail market, are unlikely to see a robust recovery just yet, she said.\n\nSkeptics also say the profitability gains have been mostly fueled by cost cuts rather than rising sales or greater pricing power.\n\n\u201cEven though there\u2019s always room for cost reduction, it\u2019s not a sustainable source of earnings growth,\u201d said Nicholas Chui, a fund manager at Franklin Templeton Investments in Hong Kong. \u201cRightfully, investors are on the lookout for more repeatable sources.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home How Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Tesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That\u2019s a Good Thing Chris Dixon\u2019s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto\u2019s Grifty Reputation\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Chinese economy and many Chinese companies have struggled on a general scale over the last few years. The slowdown was primarily due to tightening government regulations and property pricing halting the expected recovery after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in 2023.\n\nWhile these macroeconomic conditions create uncertainty and scare away many investors, they offer a unique opportunity to find Chinese stocks that are performing exceedingly well but still receive low valuations. These three stocks offer investors the perfect chance to capitalize on these low prices and enjoy the fruits of these successful companies\u2019 labor.\n\nLet\u2019s learn more about the exciting products and services, smart investments and diverse revenue streams that give these undervalued stocks the best chance to weather the macroeconomic storm.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a Chinese tech company with diverse offerings and services. It operates in several different markets, including mobile gaming, music streaming, messaging and cloud-platform services.\n\nTencent generates a considerable portion of its revenue through its widely popular mobile games, such as PUBG Mobile and Honor of Kings. The number of Tencent mobile and PC games that surpassed the Chinese average daily user count of 5 million for mobile and 2 million for PC increased to 8 games in 2023 from 6 in 2022.\n\nTencent\u2019s gaming segment is estimated to account for a little less than half of the company\u2019s revenue, which reached $86.0 billion in 2023. However, the company also has a wildly successful messaging platform, WeChat, with over 1.3 billion monthly active users.\n\nTencent plans to monetize further and improve profits from WeChat by focusing on advertising for many other services. Tencent has gaming and advertising to continue to drive profits but also has a foothold in cloud services and business software, giving it much-needed diversity to survive and grow long-term.\n\nOverall, the company\u2019s excellent prospects and $41.4 billion gross profit for 2023 make its 16.71 P/E ratio too good to be true. Investors should look no further for an undervalued Chinese stock to buy this month.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is another promising Chinese tech company with an established reputation. It is one of China\u2019s most popular search engines and has an exciting cloud platform, giving it great potential to perform. Baidu has also expanded its investment base, starting a $145 million venture capital fund for generative AI start-ups last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some investors are hesitant due to Baidu\u2019s close relationship with the Chinese government, there is less reason to fear the risk of delisting when the stock is valued relatively low. Baidu trades at a P/E ratio of 18.3, and while it had a modest 9% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023, the company has a fantastic potential upside.\n\nRecently, Baidu\u2019s AI chatbot tool \u201cErnie\u201d was reported to have reached over 200 million users and is frequently compared to ChatGPT. The potential that such a popular and advanced tech tool brings to Baidu\u2019s future is undeniable.\n\nWhile Baidu\u2019s appeal to American investors carries some risk, if you can stomach it, it is one of the best buys in Chinese stocks. Its potential to continue to grow as a search engine giant, along with several other revenue streams trading at a low valuation, is undeniable.\n\nAlibaba Group Holdings (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba Group Holdings (NYSE:BABA) is another tech company with a wide range of services and platforms and phenomenal growth potential. Alibaba is not only one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world but also provides media, entertainment, and cloud platform services.\n\nIn Alibaba\u2019s most recent earnings, the company reported $62,904 million in revenue for fiscal 2024, an 11% year-over-year increase. Free cash flow reached $11,556 million, representing an increase of 46% year-over-year.\n\nThe stock is performing exceedingly well, considering its P/E ratio of 17.3. It is, without a doubt, undervalued from a purely financial perspective. Alibaba also has a history of making intelligent investments to secure its future, investing $1 billion in its partners to support the ecosystem of its up-and-coming cloud platform.\n\nFuture growth is almost inevitable, and the Chinese government and economy are factors to consider, but this should not make you count this excellent tech stock out for good.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Social media stocks have had plenty of activity in the past couple of months. Reddit (NYSE:RDDT)\u00a0went public to much fanfare, while former President Trump\u2019s controversial Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) finally completed its merger with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. Moreover, we recently saw the leading social media giants dish out another solid quarter of growth across both lines. Hence, it\u2019s tough to remove social stocks to buy out of the equation.\n\nThough the conversation has centered around artificial intelligence (AI) over the past year, the truth is that even without it, social media sites remain incredibly profitable investments. AI will lead to greater engagement and time spent on top social media platforms. More time spent means more opportunities for social media companies to milk more from their user base. With that thought, here are three social media stocks that stand head and shoulders above the rest.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) someone using the Facebook (FB stock) app on their phone in front of a laptop that also has the Facebook webpage on it\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo social media stocks to buy list is complete without Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). It\u2019s behind some of the biggest social media platforms of all time, effectively shaping the modern social media landscape. Its family of apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, collectively boast an eye-popping user base of 3.98 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast year was massive for Meta\u2019s business and stock. Meta made impressive inroads on the AI front while streamlining its operations to cut costs. The results were staggering, resulting in more than a 50% increase in free cash flow and top- and bottom-line beats in each of the four quarters.\n\nIt recently posted impressive first-quarter (Q1) earnings results, blowing past analyst estimates across both lines. Its revenues increased roughly 27% to $36.46 billion, beating estimates by $231.9 million. Moreover, its earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71, beat estimates by 35 cents. However, its stock nosedived following the release of cautious forward guidance. The market has this wrong, making it an excellent time to scoop up the stock on the dip.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Hand holding Apple Iphone6 gold color with Pinterest app on the screen.

PINS stock.\n\nSource: photobyphotoboy / Shutterstock\n\nThe image-based social media platform\u00a0Pinterest (NYSE:PINS)\u00a0is on fire right now. \u00a0Following its Q1 earnings print, the stock jumped by double digits, which crushed estimates across both lines. Moreover, it surpassed $500 million monthly users, a record-high for the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nPinterest\u2019s Q1 revenues demonstrated a robust growth of 23%, reaching an impressive $740 million. This surpassed analyst estimates by a substantial $40 million. Furthermore, the company\u2019s strategic cost reduction of 6% led to a significant decrease in its operating loss, from $ 243.7 million to $54.4 million. The average revenue-per-user (ARPU) also saw a healthy increase of 10% globally, reflecting the platform\u2019s strong performance across all regions.\n\nThese spectacular results were reminiscent of Pinterest\u2019s peak popularity during the pandemic years. In fact, according to CEO Bill Ready, its Q1 results showed the \u201cfastest user and revenue growth since 2021\u201d.\n\nPINS stock skyrocketed last year, growing almost 90%, and is up 16% this month despite the pullback in the broader market. Despite the eye-catching gains, analysts expect a 6% upside from current prices based on average price targets.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is one of the leading Chinese social media players, leveraging the power of its robust super-app WeChat. With a whopping 1.3 billion monthly active users, WeChat has its tentacles spread across various tech verticals, including fintech, gaming, telehealth and now AI. The evolution of the app has allowed Tencent to enhance user engagement across its platform effectively. Moreover, despite the looming threat of regulatory oversight, the company has played it safe, effectively minimizing the risk of disruptive penalties from the Chinese government.\n\nRecent operating results have been marred by headwinds in the Chinese market, but the firm has done well in maintaining decent growth while maintaining its profitability positioning. Moreover, it unveiled its dynamic Hunyuan AI model, which could potentially be a major growth catalyst for the firm down the road.\n\nTCEHY stock was relatively muted compared to other tech players in 2023 but has made up for lost ground this year. The stock is up roughly 25% year-to-date (YTD), with more upside potential ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, there are many overlooked gems whose immense potential fails to garner the attention it deserves from investors. These stocks could reach that coveted trillion-dollar status by 2030 if their momentum accelerates.\n\nWe\u2019ve witnessed the recent AI rally, a prime example of how swiftly the market can propel companies into the stratosphere when a particular theme catches fire. If the stars align for the following three companies, they too could break into the trillionaire\u2019s club. Buying these stocks while they\u2019re still relatively obscure compared to companies of a similar size is a rational move. After all, the early bird catches the worm on Wall Street. Here are the three under-the-radar stocks to consider in this light.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is one of China\u2019s biggest companies, yet it remains relatively unknown in the West. You may have heard its name, but many overlook the\u00a0sheer\u00a0size and outreach this behemoth commands across emerging markets. Tencent has its tentacles in many key growth sectors, from gaming to social media and\u00a0all kinds of\u00a0electronics.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, Tencent suffered a rapid decline in 2021, and like the broader Chinese stock market, this company\u2019s plunge continued for the past few years before slowing down recently. China has taken key steps like stimulus measures and recent rate cuts\u00a0to finally prop up its free-falling stock market. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese equity market has shown signs of recovering, with the Hang Seng Index up 10% year-to-date and Tencent up 23% year-to-date. In my view, Tencent has significantly more room to run in the coming years,\u00a0mostly fueled\u00a0by demand\u00a0coming\u00a0from emerging economies in the rest of Asia. Its low-cost appliances are very competitive and boast a solid brand image.

AVGO trend\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nHowever,\u00a0I would note that\u00a0the AI hype train would have to continue full-speed for this to happen.\u00a0Many semiconductor stocks have been taking a\u00a0breather\u00a0as of late, but Broadcom has weathered the storm quite well, so I have good conviction in this name moving forward.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) has been one of the biggest winners in the healthcare sector and arguably the second biggest, only behind Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). The stock is up a staggering 422% over the past five years. This prolonged rally\u00a0was mostly triggered\u00a0by the company\u2019s weight loss and diabetes drugs outperforming expectations. Wegovy sales have more than doubled, with soaring demand outstripping supply.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s earnings per share are expected\u00a0to grow 32% this year to $3.60 and surge to $5.70 in 2028.\u00a0I believe\u00a0Novo Nordisk can\u00a0greatly\u00a0outperform these expectations due to the\u00a0amount of\u00a0demand we\u2019ve seen so far. NVO EPS\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nOn top of all this, Novo Nordisk\u2019s parent company, Novo Holdings, plans to buy drug manufacturer Catalent for $16.5 billion to boost production of weight-loss and diabetes drugs, including Wegovy and Ozempic. This streamlining could make the company worth $1 trillion or more in the next six years if this trend of outperformance continues. The company\u2019s future three to five-year annual revenue growth rate comes in at nearly 19%.\n\nWe could see some near-term bearish action as this rally has been very hot, but the long-term potential with this company is clearly solid.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If any company reflects the state of China\u2019s economy, it would be e-commerce and cloud-computing firm\u00a0Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Perhaps Alibaba stock is a bullish bet on China\u2019s economic recovery, just as much as a wager on Alibaba as a company. In that light, there are definite risks to investing in Alibaba, though there are also potential rewards.\n\nAs I\u2019ve previously discussed, Alibaba is very reasonably valued and offers some portfolio exposure to generative artificial intelligence. I\u2019m not against investing in Alibaba for the long term. Today, however, I\u2019m suggesting keeping your Alibaba share position small, if you choose to take a position at all.\n\nAlibaba and China\u2019s Uneven Recovery\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting one stock represents the entirety of China\u2019s economy. However, if you own Alibaba stock, and perhaps also add some Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock, you\u2019ll practically have a do-it-yourself China exchange-traded fund.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and supply-chain constraints have caused ongoing problems for each of these China-based businesses. Certainly, China\u2019s uneven recovery has weighed on Alibaba\u2019s financial results. Alibaba founder Jack Ma remains confident; he assured,\u00a0\u201cWe are\u00a0starting to operate on the diseases of a big company.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all fine and well, but Alibaba and other technology-focused China-based businesses have to contend with governmental interference. Remember, if you own Alibaba stock as a proxy for China\u2019s economy, then your portfolio will be exposed to China\u2019s problems.\n\nAmong those problems is China President Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on the nation\u2019s biggest businesses. Beijing\u2019s (i.e., the Chinese government\u2019s) restrictive policies have weighed heavily on companies like Alibaba, Nio and Tencent.\n\nGood News and Bad News From China\n\nOn the economic front, there\u2019s good news and bad news for China and, by extension, for Alibaba. The good news is that China\u2019s first-quarter 2024 gross domestic product (GDP) increased 5.3% year over year. Economists had only expected China\u2019s GDP to grow 4.5% YOY.\n\nHowever, Beijing could introduce new, restrictive policies at any given moment. Furthermore, not all of the data from China is positive. For example, China\u2019s industrial output increased 4.5% YOY in March, while economists had expected 5.5% growth.\n\nChina\u2019s retail sales grew 3.1% YOY in March, and this result fell short of the economists\u2019 prediction of 4.5% growth.\n\nZichun Huang, an economist with Capital Economics, concluded that China\u2019s economic recovery \u201cclearly remains fragile.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Alibaba\u2019s investors will need to closely monitor the ongoing developments in China. It won\u2019t be enough to just study Alibaba\u2019s earnings reports; I wish it could be as simple as that, but it\u2019s not.\n\nAlibaba Stock: Consider Your Position Sizing\n\nI\u2019m not trying to dissuade you from investing in Alibaba. It\u2019s a huge, famous company, and Ma\u2019s confidence should provide some encouragement.\n\nOn the other hand, China\u2019s problems will also be Alibaba\u2019s problems. If Beijing inhibits the country\u2019s economic growth, Alibaba and its stakeholders will have major problems.\n\nSensible investors should understand the political/macroeconomic risks and only own a few shares of Alibaba stock. If you\u2019re not prepared to conduct your due diligence on China\u2019s economy, you don\u2019t have to invest in Alibaba at all.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

More recently, they have been left flatfooted as local manufacturers led by BYD have snatched market share with software-laden electric vehicles aimed at younger drivers.\n\nBoth Tencent, a gaming and social media giant and Baidu, China's leading search engine, have been leaders in the country's generative AI race.\n\nToyota, the world's largest carmaker by volume, will include technology from tech giant Tencent technology in a China-made passenger vehicle that will go on sale this year, said Toyota's Yiming Xu, a director for brand and communications for China.\n\nThe companies will offer services through Tencent's strengths in big data, AI and cloud computing, Xu said.\n\nNissan said it and Baidu had signed a memorandum of understanding to carry out research on AI and so-called \"smart cars\". Nissan will use Baidu's generative AI on its platform to study the feasibility of future tech development, it said.\n\nIt will also equip its Chinese cars with Baidu's AI products, it said.\n\nThe partnerships also show how competitive China has become for automakers, even globe-spanning giants such as Toyota.\n\nForeign automakers are fighting to show they can remain relevant in China, amid the pressure from the shift to EVs, the rise of domestic brands and a price war.\n\nToyota has seen sales shrink, although it has avoided the sharp blows that Honda Motor and Nissan have taken.\n\nIt saw its sales in China fall 1.7% to 1.9 million vehicles in 2023, the second successive year of decline.\n\nToyota also showed off two new battery electric vehicle models for the Chinese market at the Beijing show.

In contrast, US tech giants have slipped on reduced expectations for profit growth as they attempt to deliver on the promise of artificial intelligence.\n\nTencent should return to sequential profit growth in the current quarter on strength in games and short videos, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Robert Lea and Jasmine Lyu. Still the shares are trading at less than 16 times projected earnings compared with a five-year average of nearly 23 times and 28 times for a gauge tracking the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe measure of the largest US tech stocks is down about 4% this month, amid concerns that the steep climbs in Nvidia Corp. and others may have been overdone. Technical signals, meanwhile, indicate Tencent may be poised for further gains, with its 50-day moving average on track to close above the 100-day level.\n\n--With assistance from Ishika Mookerjee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender Big Junk Food\u2019s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets China\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires Skip the Robotaxi\u2014Tesla Investors Want a Cheap EV\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Many investors are understandably somewhat skeptical of which\u00a0metaverse\u00a0stocks to buy following their uneven debut.\n\nThe theme had a ton of excitement and traction back 2021. So much so, in fact, that Mark Zuckerberg renamed his company from Facebook to\u00a0Meta\u00a0Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to reflect what he felt might be the next big growth avenue in the tech landscape. So far that hasn\u2019t played out, or at least not on the timeline that\u00a0metaverse\u00a0optimists may have been hoping for.\n\nBut the concept of an online meeting space where people can work, collaborate, socialize, and play games together remains compelling. And with technology rapidly advancing, there are better and better things that tech companies can achieve within an augmented or virtual reality setting. As a catalyst for the\u00a0metaverse, earlier this year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its Apple Vision Pro, which could greatly expand the marketplace and adoption of augmented and virtual reality solutions.

A developer can build a game in Unity and quickly release it across console, PC, smartphone, and augmented and virtual reality. In fact, reports suggested that Mark Zuckerberg considered acquiring Unity to make it a core part of the Oculus ecosystem.\n\nHowever, Unity has remained independent and can offer its graphic solutions to the entire gamut of game and app developers. Of note, Unity is one of the key partners in developing apps and experiences for the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nUnity shares have underperformed much of the tech market, as the company is still experimenting with monetization and there are also questions around its advertising-driven revenue streams. However, in the longer-term, Unity has a great graphics engine. If it can solve commercialization issues, Unity should be set for significant upside with the\u00a0metaverse\u00a0being an intriguing piece of its broader story.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Matterport company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass. MTTR stock.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock\n\nMatterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) is a property technology company. Its core business model is to have clients take high-quality imagery of their properties. Matterport can use this imagery to create detailed 3-D renderings of a property and allow the owner to host virtual walk-throughs and site visits.\n\nStory continues\n\nA wedding venue, for example, could offer virtual tours to help potential customers see and experience what their venue would be like without having to go there in person first.\n\nAs technology such as the Apple Vision Pro gains adoption, it will be easier and easier for customers to take part in the digital tour and walk-throughs. Clients such as hotels, resorts, and office buildings will increasingly embrace Matterport as folks become more accustomed to digital property tours.\n\nMatterport has gotten off to a slow start as a publicly traded company. The former SPAC has seen shares lose the majority of their value; however, the firm\u2019s revenues continue to grow. Analysts see the company generating about $176 million in sales this year, which would be up 11% from last year. And further, analysts expect the company to reach profitability on an earnings per share basis in 2026.\n\nMatterport has overcome a rocky transition from a hardware and licensing model towards recurring subscription revenue. As investors gain confidence in its business direction, and people continue to adopt and augmented reality solutions, MTTR stock should be set for a comeback.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a large Chinese technology and media conglomerate. It both operates its own business and maintains investment stakes in a vast array of companies.\n\nTencent Holdings shares have plunged in recent years due to China\u2019s decline in consumer spending and economic slump. However, Tencent should be ripe for a rebound as it has numerous ways to profit from China\u2019s economic recovery.\n\nAs it pertains to the\u00a0metaverse, Tencent is a leading video gaming company. It has its own media operations, and it also invests in other leading video game developers. Its large holding in Epic Games gives it a particular leg up in the\u00a0metaverse\u00a0space.\n\nThat\u2019s because Epic runs Fortnite, which is arguably the most successful metaverse\u00a0property to date. Fortnite has gained incredible mind share with younger players which has allowed it to attract large international brands who have set up digital stores in the Fortnite universe. Additionally, Fortnite hosts concerts and media events which attract players for unique experiences and allow all sorts of branding, product sales, and other monetization opportunities.\n\nTencent was ahead of the curve in taking a large ownership position in Epic and other gaming properties. It should be poised to profit from the\u00a0metaverse, regardless of which particular games, experiences, and brands end up attracting the most\u00a0metaverse\u00a0users over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in U stock.

        "content": "The broad basket of social media stocks has much to gain as they seek to trim inefficiencies while investing in various growth drivers. Undoubtedly, generative artificial intelligence (AI) can help many big-name social media firms better monetize their swollen user bases.\n\nAdditionally, AI seems to be the magic solution to automating less-than-efficient aspects of operations while driving forth innovative features and profitability opportunities. As AI becomes the new normal, while various firms look to enter the metaverse, social media companies must invest to stay relevant as the \u201cspatial\u201d medium gradually inches into our everyday lives.\n\nUndoubtedly, those chunky, often expensive headsets may remain quite niche for now. But social media firms add another dimension to their products; perhaps the headsets will gain the \u201ckiller apps\u201d that we all seek as reasons to make the big splurge on fancy face computers!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUndoubtedly, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues to flex its muscles as one of the biggest and best social media stocks to buy now. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a genius, and he\u2019s not about to lift his foot off the pedal after driving efficiencies and making cuts to less \u201cgrowthy\u201d parts of his business.\n\nEven after Meta\u2019s multi-year, multi-bagger run, various analysts see more room for growth as the firm looks to expand its advertising business. Ronald Josey over at Citigroup (NYSE:C) sees META stock climbing to $590.00 per share on the back of \u201cnewer ad innovations,\u201d including Advantage+ Creative and a long-form version of its TikTok rival Reels. Such a price target entails an 18% gain from here.\n\nIn many ways, Meta stands out as one of the best that the Magnificent Seven has to offer. Whether we\u2019re talking about the firm\u2019s new advertising tools, its powerful AI team hard at work on next-generation models, its relatively affordable line of headsets to plug into its metaverse, and its \u201cmoaty\u201d family of social apps, Meta has no shortage of growth levers. In the coming month, Meta will be ready to launch the latest version of its open-source AI model: LLaMA 3\n\nOver the next year, I expect the company to continue outpacing the market as it pulls all of them simultaneously.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms have seen increased business overlap in recent years.\n\nThough Alphabet doesn\u2019t share Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s ambition for the future of the metaverse or virtual reality, both firms are clashing for generative AI dominance. Alphabet\u2019s Google Gemini is a capable large language model (LLM) that competes with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Meta\u2019s LLaMA.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s not just AI where Alphabet will compete against Meta for market dominance. Alphabet\u2019s YouTube platform competes against Meta\u2019s social-media family of apps in a battle for user engagement. In the short-form video scene, YouTube Shorts and Meta Reels could take their battle to the next level if some sort of TikTok ban were implemented in the U.S.\n\nEither way, Alphabet may very well be home to the most influential social media platform. With Shorts and live streaming, it will be interesting to see how the ecosystem evolves in the age of AI-created content.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent stock TCEHY stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTencentHoldings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is the social media powerhouse in China, with its dominant super-app WeChat bringing in more than 1.3 billion monthly active users as of the latest quarter. Undoubtedly, WeChat has branched out to offer a wide range of services to monetize the firm\u2019s massive user base. From payments to gaming, WeChat is pretty much a mobile operating system within a single app.\n\nThough Tencent\u2019s dominance puts it at risk of increased regulatory scrutiny, the firm has taken steps to ensure it\u2019s playing by the Chinese government\u2019s rules to avoid costly penalties and hurdles that could weigh on future growth.\n\nAt the time of this writing, TCEHY shares trade at 23.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), making it one of the cheapest mega-cap social-media titans in the world. Still, off over 61% from its all-time high, Tencent shares look like a rather untimely bargain for those hungry for exposure to the Chinese economy while it\u2019s still in a slump.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owns shares of Alphabet (Class C).

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s profit surged roughly 60% in 2023, outpacing the growth of online peers Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in a sign of the TikTok owner\u2019s resilience in the face of an economic downturn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets Bond Trader Places Record Futures Bet on Eve of Inflation Data Iran\u2019s Better, Stealthier Drones Are Remaking Global Warfare Trumpism Is Emptying Churches Ukraine Says It\u2019s Behind Blaze on Russian Warship in Baltic Sea\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization jumped to more than $40 billion from about $25 billion in 2022, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private information. The world\u2019s most valuable startup also grew sales to nearly $120 billion from $80 billion, the people said.\n\nThe results mark the first time that ByteDance has overtaken archrival Tencent both in revenue and profit, as it leveraged its popular short-video platforms to expand into international e-commerce and sustain its global popularity. While ByteDance\u2019s internal figures haven\u2019t been independently audited, they suggest the ad-churning social media juggernaut became one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing tech giants in 2023.\n\nA ByteDance spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe owner of TikTok and Chinese twin Douyin last year cemented its position as one of China\u2019s internet leaders, alongside Tencent and Alibaba, which have both struggled to rekindle growth at a time of economic uncertainty and consumer wariness in the country.\n\nIn the domestic market, Douyin is morphing into an all-in-one platform akin to Tencent\u2019s WeChat, with its added features encroaching on Alibaba\u2019s ecommerce turf and competing with Meituan for food delivery orders. Even with the strong results, ByteDance decided to overhaul management of its China operations in February, with Kelly Zhang stepping down from the chief executive role without plans for appointing a successor.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverseas, the successful rollout of TikTok Shop in markets like the US and Southeast Asia have unlocked new revenue sources beyond digital marketing. TikTok is seeking to grow the size of its US ecommerce business tenfold this year. It has 170 million users in the country.\n\nThat\u2019s despite TikTok\u2019s existential crisis in its most lucrative market. In March, the US House of Representatives passed a bill to ban TikTok in the US unless ByteDance sells its prized asset, though the measure faces a less certain outcome in the Senate. The presidential rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump later in the year, along with Beijing\u2019s response, could also complicate matters.\n\nLike its China peers, ByteDance has started to unwind risky bets in recent months. It has cut hundreds of jobs at its gaming development and enterprise software units, which dragged profitability and largely failed to live up to their promises. Instead, the company is trying to catch up on generative AI, building its own chatbots and large language model.\n\nByteDance\u2019s long-awaited stock market debut remains a distant possibility, as the company grapples with elevated scrutiny in the US. In December, the firm offered to buy back up to $5 billion in shares from investors at a valuation of $268 billion. At its peak, ByteDance was valued at more than $400 billion in some private trading.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit\u2014With an Uncertain Future Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 fastest growing economies in Asia in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Economies in Asia in 2024.\n\nAsian Economy to Deliver Two-thirds to Global Growth in 2024\n\nWith global growth proving to be more resilient than expected and inflation rates declining steadily, the IMF expects the global economy to grow at the previous year's rate of 3.1% in 2024 as well. Looking ahead, global growth is anticipated to increase modestly by 0.1% to reach 3.2% in 2025. Similar to the global growth trend of a strong economic recovery, the growth expectations for Asia have been raised. According to the January 30 report by the IMF, the region's economic growth for 2023 was revised upwards to be at 4.7%, as opposed to the October 2023 projections of 4.6%.\n\nThe regional growth forecasts for 2024 have also improved, and Asia's economic growth for the year is now projected at 4.5%, against the previous expectation of 4.2%. The emerging economy of India, which is demonstrating a strong domestic demand, and China's higher spending on disaster reconstruction and resilience projects are said to be the main contributing factors behind the upward revisions. Moreover, other notable factors boosting the region's economic growth include positive spillover from 2023, a supportive external environment, economic growth in the United States fostering high demand for technology, and positive policy stimulus from strong economies such as China and Thailand. To read more about the Asian economy, you can look at the 23 Richest Countries in Asia by GDP Per Capita in 2023 and the 25 Poorest Countries in Asia by GDP per Capita.\n\nAs a result of the aforementioned factors, the region is on track to lead the global growth in 2024, the same as the previous year, and is expected to contribute two-thirds to the global growth. However, the continued economic resilience of the region is subject to effective risk management. Some potential challenges facing the Asian economy include the deteriorating property sector of China, the financial volatility of some highly indebted economies, a long and inefficient supply chain, and the threat of higher shipping costs. On the bright side, effective monetary and fiscal policies to manage these threats can further boost the economy. On January 30, Reuters reported that the IMF believes that China's economy could recover faster than expected if the government makes additional property and structural reforms to boost consumer confidence.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Players Leading the Asian Economy\n\nHDFC Bank Limited (NYSE:HDB), Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY), and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) are some of the players leading the Asian economy. To read more about Asian companies, you can look at 20 Most Valuable Asian Companies Heading into 2024.\n\nHDFC Bank Limited (NYSE:HDB) is one of the largest financial services and banking companies headquartered in Mumbai, India. The bank has a multinational presence and provides financial services to its customers in India, Dubai, Bahrain, and Hong Kong. It operates through three major segments: retail banking, wholesale banking, and treasury services. On March 21, HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE:HDB) announced its partnership with The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TSE:TD) to simplify the banking services for Indian students based in Canada. As a result of this agreement, both banks have announced new referral programs for students planning to study in Canada. Aspiring Indian students will be referred to The Toronto-Dominion Bank's (TSE:TD) international student GIC program that helps students comply with the Canadian government's Student Direct Stream study permit. This agreement builds upon the long-running partnership between both banks since 2015, where The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TSE:TD) has acted as a corresponding banking partner of HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE:HDB).\n\nTencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) is another multinational technology company based in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. It is one of the world's leading internet and technology conglomerates that provides entertainment, communication, e-commerce, advertising, and online payment services. On March 5, Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) announced its partnership with the Etihad Etisalat Company (TADAWUL:7020), revolutionizing the digital landscape of Saudi Arabia under the 'Go Saudi' program. Etihad Etisalat Company (TADAWUL:7020), also known as Mobily, is a leading digital technology and media company in Saudi Arabia. The collaboration will allow Mobily to diversify its enterprise business solutions and tap into new technologies using Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) cloud services.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) is a leading multinational automobile manufacturing company based in Japan. The company designs, manufactures, assembles, and sells automotive vehicles and has a market presence in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

Both of these indicators are internationally recognized for measuring the health and progress of an economy. We sourced the real GDP growth rates for 2024 from the IMF database and calculated the annual GDP per capita growth for each country between 2023 and 2024 using GDP per capita at current prices data from the IMF. The list is ranked in ascending order of the real GDP growth rates (2024), our primary metric, and GDP per capita growth rates (2024), our secondary metric. Wherever a tie-break was required, we used the secondary metrics to break the tie.\n\nPlease note that we have not included the Middle Eastern countries in our list of 20 fastest growing economies in Asia in 2024.\n\n20 Fastest Growing Economies in Asia in 2024\n\n20.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 most profitable tech stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\nNow, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.\n\nSo naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public. With the first quarter of the new year now ending, analysts and investors are pouring over the latest products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling. NVIDIA recently held its GTC Developers conference, an annual event, where it revealed its latest Blackwell GPU for AI. This GPU promises to reduce operating costs and energy usage by up to 25 times when compared to predecessors.\n\nNVIDIA's chief Jensen Huang also provided details about Blackwell's design and costs in an interview with CNBC where he shared:\n\nYes, a mathematician, right? Yeah, yeah, really terrific mathematician. And this computer here will replace thousands of general-purpose computers. This is the part that's incredible. In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence.\n\nJensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion. NVIDIA is currently valued at $2.28 trillion, making the multi billion dollar spend a drop in its massive market capitalization. The shares have gained 248% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 Information Technology index's 53% gain over the past year by a wide margin.\n\nSo, with the dynamics of the global technology industry shifting, we decided to take a look at the top tech stocks in terms of net profit that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most profitable tech stocks to invest in, we ranked all technology companies by their trailing twelve month net income and picked the top stocks.\n\nFor these most profitable tech stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\n16.

        "title": "Netflix's '3 Body Problem' leaves jaws dropped among Chinese viewers",
        "content": "BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - A Netflix adaptation of a Chinese science-fiction classic \"The Three-Body Problem\" found a large audience in China on the first day of its release despite the streaming service not being available there, and prompted immediate debate on social media.\n\nThe Netflix series \"3 Body Problem\" is an adaptation of the first novel in a trilogy by Chinese author Liu Cixin, and made for the screen by the creators of \"Games of Thrones\".\n\nLiu's novel has sold millions of copies since it was published in Chinese in 2008 and counts former U.S. President Barack Obama among its fans. The English translation was the first novel by an Asian writer to win science fiction's Hugo Award for best novel.\n\nThe Netflix version, like the English translation of the novel, starts with violent scenes from China's Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, events that set in motion a plot that includes an impending alien invasion.\n\nThe new series was trending on Chinese social media platform Weibo on Friday with 21 million views so far and was first on the platform's \"top hot\" trend rankings despite Netflix being officially inaccessible in China. Chinese viewers would have had to watch the Netflix series from behind a VPN or on a pirate site.\n\n\"Jaw dropping\" moments for Chinese viewers included an opening scene where a prominent scientist is beaten to death by paramilitary Red Guards, a depiction of recent history that remains controversial in China.\n\n\"The first scene made my jaw drop. Even though I had anticipated this, the scene still startled me,\" said one Weibo user.\n\nThe video unit of Tencent Holdings released a 30-episode, Chinese language adaptation of the series last year. On Monday, seeking to capitalise on the publicity, Tencent Video released a streamlined version, and many online commentators said the made-in-China version was better.\n\nThe tagline \"China version wins\" was shown as trending on Weibo on Friday as one of the most-discussed topics of the day.\n\nStory continues\n\nOthers objected to the way the Netflix adaptation shifts the action from China to a group of British physicists nicknamed the \"Oxford Five\". That showed \"Westerners fundamentally can't accept the idea of Chinese people inventing cutting-edge technology\", one viewer posted on the ratings and social network site Douban.\n\nAnother Douban user said Netflix had short-changed the Chinese elements of the story for \"a Hollywood product that values individual heroism\".\n\nSome viewers said critics were missing the point: a work of Chinese fiction was becoming even more widely known around the world. \"Is it somehow a bad thing for the Netflix adaptation to become a global sensation?\" a third Douban user said.

        "title": "Tencent's next level up: fewer big foreign franchise games, more in-house",
        "content": "By Josh Ye\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - In a sea change at China's Tencent, an easy-to-play game of cute characters tackling obstacle courses has taken precedence over developing a big-budget sophisticated foreign franchise for smartphones.\n\nSince late last year, the world's largest video games company has, according to sources, redeployed hundreds of people from the team developing \"Assassin's Creed Jade\" for mobile - a multi-year project with France's Ubisoft.\n\nThey are now working on recently launched \"DreamStar\" - Tencent's answer to rival NetEase's hit \"Eggy Party\" and the company's most high-profile attempt to date at the so-called party game genre which offers simple gameplay, minigames and encourages players to hang out and chat.\n\nAs a result, \"Assassin's Creed Jade\" - an action-adventure game set in ancient China that has been under development for mobile for at least four years - will likely be released in 2025 instead of this year, according to three sources familiar with the matter. They were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.\n\nThe redeployment of resources highlights the trends forcing a strategic pivot at Tencent. Firstly, developing big-name Western franchises for mobile phones tends to yield thin margins.\n\nAt the same time, rivals have had breakout hits with ostensibly niche products that offer new takes on gaming such as as NetEase's \"Eggy Party\" and miHoYo's anime-style fantasy game \"Genshin Impact\". Moreover, the games were developed in-house so their profits are all their own.\n\nTencent had, for years, great success by developing for smartphones international hits like Activision Blizzard's shooter game \"Call of Duty\" and the battle royale game \"PUBG\" by South Korea's Krafton.\n\nBut such franchise games - called IP (intellectual property) games - are costly to make. Royalty fees of 15% to 20% of sales are typical, Apple's App Store takes a 30% cut while marketing and user acquisition expenses can cost another 30% to 40%, the sources said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter a string of IP game setbacks, Tencent plans to be more selective.\n\n\"We're focusing on fewer bigger budget games. Typically, we're seeking to make the biggest bets around games that either iterate on a successful IP ... or games that are iterating around proven gameplay success within a niche and taking those to a more mass market,\" Tencent Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell told an earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nTencent is now also pushing for royalty fees to fall to under 10% of sales in some negotiations, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\n\"That would have been almost unthinkable just a few years ago. Tencent used to be far more generous,\" the person said.\n\nTencent declined to comment on details of its strategic shift.\n\nSETBACKS AND BAMBOO SHOOTS\n\nOn Wednesday, Tencent reported a slight decline in fourth-quarter gaming sales and also flagged that overall gaming revenue this quarter would be soft compared with the same period last year when gaming sales surged as pandemic restrictions were lifted.\n\nPony Ma, Tencent's founder and chief executive, has been blunt that the company's video game division - which last year generated 180 billion yuan ($25 billion) in sales or around 30%of overall revenue - needs to do better.\n\nCompetitors have continued to create new products, \"leaving us feeling we have achieved nothing,\" he told a stadium of employees in Shenzhen at the company's annual meeting in January, according to a separate source with direct knowledge of the event.\n\nThat month, Tencent also launched its \"Spring Bamboo Shoots Project\", aiming to incubate in-house games with novel gameplay and offering budgets of up to 300 million yuan ($42 million) per game.\n\nWhile that is much less than budgets of 1 billion yuan for a major franchise, the initiative signals Tencent is willing to take more risks on non-conventional game design, the sources said.\n\nSome major setbacks have only increased the sense of urgency for change.\n\nLast year, Electronic Arts discontinued \"Apex Legends Mobile\", a game developed by Tencent, with executives at the U.S. firm saying it had fallen short of expected quality.\n\nIn December, Tencent axed development of a mobile game based on the \"Nier\" franchise from Japan's Square Enix, in part because the Chinese firm struggled to find a compelling monetisation model given its expensive development costs and franchise rights, sources have said.\n\n\"Mobile games studios have learned that IP is not the magic bullet for user acquisition it once was,\" says Serkan Toto, founder of game industry consultancy Kantan Games.\n\nTencent has also seen a key in-house game bomb. \"Undawn\", a zombie apocalypse shooting game that Hollywood star Will Smith was hired to endorse, flopped spectacularly despite having a budget of close to 1 billion yuan with more than 300 developers, according to two of the sources.\n\nLast month, one year since its launch, \"Undawn\" brought in revenue of just $287,000, according to research firm Appmagic.\n\nWestern companies have also started to shift away from outsourcing mobile game development to Chinese companies like Tencent. Microsoft's Activision Blizzard, for example, has just launched \"Call of Duty Warzone Mobile\" which will compete directly with Tencent's \"Call of Duty Mobile\".\n\nAdding salt to the wound, Tencent's top two games saw revenue slide during the week-long Lunar New Year holidays in February. \"Honor of Kings\" and \"PUBG Mobile\", which are nine and seven years old respectively, suffered 7% and 30% drops compared to the holiday period last year, according to one of the sources who was briefed on the matter.\n\n($1 = 7.1979 Chinese yuan)\n\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Brenda Goh and Edwina Gibbs)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s revenue missed estimates, in another sign that China\u2019s faltering economic recovery is taking a toll on its gaming and social media portfolios.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team Apple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Ultra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago\u2019s Most Elite Neighborhood What Happens If Trump Can\u2019t Post His $454 Million Bond Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips\n\nRevenue rose a less-than-expected 7% to 155.2 billion yuan ($21.6 billion) for the three months ended December, compared with the 157.4 billion yuan average forecast. Net income was 27 billion yuan, versus the 33.3 billion yuan projected. On Wednesday, Tencent also said it was at least doubling its share buyback program to more than HK$100 billion ($12.8 billion) in 2024.\n\nThe results cast doubt over the growth trajectory of the world\u2019s largest internet arena, which has yet to bounce back fully from years of regulatory and economic turmoil. Investors are grappling with mixed signals about the Chinese economy, which has struggled to regain its pre-Covid velocity.\n\nBeijing\u2019s government is still contending with a plethora of structural problems from a prolonged property crisis to stubborn inflation. Economic data released Monday, including retail sales, suggested stimulus by policymakers has finally started to pay off.\n\nSome of China\u2019s biggest tech names have sought to ramp up shareholder returns after delivering mixed results.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. unveiled $25 billion in fresh stock repurchases following disappointing December-quarter sales, while JD.com Inc.\u2019s $3 billion buyback program propelled its shares higher. Tencent\u2019s closest gaming rival, NetEase Inc., more than doubled its dividend payout from a year ago, after both revenue and earnings missed estimates.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTencent\u2019s growth is set to normalize in 2024, though it should still deliver mid-teen earnings growth, driven by continued strength in short videos and AI-enhanced ads; underpinned by cost discipline and a stabilizing regulatory environment. While Tencent continues to face medium-term structural headwinds, its revenue base is relatively well diversified, in contrast with its e-commerce peers.\n\nStory continues\n\n- Robert Lea, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nTencent faces its own challenges beyond macroeconomic uncertainties. While WeChat has proven a reliable growth driver after its short-video feed lured users and advertisers back from ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s Douyin, the company still needs to figure out where the rest of its sprawling business empire is heading.\n\nIt\u2019s struggling to retain paid subscribers on its video and music streaming services, and its cloud computing arm is in the midst of a price war with Alibaba and JD, just as that unit was seeking to reach profitability.\n\nOnce its bread-and-butter, Tencent\u2019s games division is also seeking its next big hit.\n\nSales of new casual title Dream Star declined in recent months thanks to fierce competition with NetEase, but the highly anticipated Dungeon & Fighter Mobile could help pick up the slack after the action game won a long overdue license in February.\n\nThe urgency for new gaming hits comes at a time when Beijing is again potentially ramping up scrutiny over the sector. In December, the industry regulator spooked investors by proposing new curbs on gaming content and monetization, including a cap on in-game spending it never specified. The watchdog has since signaled its intention to hear the industry out and possibly roll back some of the harsher edicts, though a final version of the rules has yet to be published after public consultation ended in January.\n\nTencent, however, has found an unlikely ally in ByteDance. The Shenzhen-based company has scooped up some talent and in-game assets from TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, after ByteDance curtailed its game ambitions, Bloomberg News has reported. Tencent also recently allowed Douyin creators to stream and reproduce content off its mainstay games, including Honor of Kings and League of Legends. That ended a years-long, unofficial ban on both sides around running content from a rival.\n\nLonger run, Tencent joins much of the Chinese tech sector in exploring the potential of generative AI. Its in-house large language model, Hunyuan, is now integrated with a suite of products including search and online marketing. Alongside arch-foe Alibaba, the WeChat operator has also made multiple bets on domestic AI model startups, helping mint new unicorns like Baichuan and Minimax.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Don Lemon Implosion China\u2019s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers\u2019 $700 Million Man, Will Transform Baseball\u2014If He Wants To Congress Should Think Bigger Than TikTok Ban, Tech Critics Say Dollar\u2019s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

That compared with the 157.2 billion yuan average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by LSEG.\n\nFor all of last year, Tencent\u2019s revenue rose 10% to 609 billion yuan, which trails expectations at 612.2 billion yuan.\n\nStill, this marks a year of recovery for Tencent, which reported its first annual revenue decline in 2022 as it was hit by Beijing\u2019s sweeping crackdown on the tech sector. By comparison, it saw revenue growth in every quarter last year.\n\nTencent's core gaming business suffered a notable slowdown in the fourth quarter.

Also, the company may join its peers in boosting capital returns through increased dividends or share buybacks.\n\nThe company has made strides with so-called mini-games \u2014 a capital-light business of making titles available within its popular WeChat app \u2014 and a livestreaming video platform that competes with TikTok\u2019s local language service in China.\n\n\u201cThe areas where Tencent has higher profitability are growing faster than the areas that have lower profitability,\u201d Ivan Su, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., said in an interview. The short video business may help the company\u2019s advertising revenue to surprise positively, he added.\n\nTencent\u2019s shares have risen about 6% over the past two months while the Hang Seng Tech Index has gained 12%. The broader internet sector has suffered a hit to advertising from China\u2019s economic slowdown as well as sporadic regulatory crackdowns, and Tencent has also been hurt by an absence of major new game titles.\n\nThe company is expected to report that sales rose 8.6% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter, the slowest expansion in a year.

Whether through dividends or buybacks, the company needs to keep pace with competitors, he said.\n\nThe shareholder yield offered by Alibaba, after including dividends and buybacks, could reach 7% this year, JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a research note. That could be a target for Tencent to aim at.\n\n\u201cThere is a compelling argument to be returning to shareholders,\u201d said Nicola Lai, investment manager for Hong Kong & China equities at Barings. \u201cWe have observed that companies who are not focused on maximizing shareholder value tend to trade at a discount.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Zheping Huang.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina\u2019s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Dollar\u2019s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad An Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls Women Are Closing the B-School Dean Gap America\u2019s Plumber Deficit Isn\u2019t Good for the Economy\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

If you want to skip our analysis, you can proceed to the section highlighting the Top 5 Largest Countries In Asia By Area In 2024.\n\nEconomy of Asia\n\nAccording to a report by the IMF, Asian economies contributed to two-thirds of global growth in 2023. It is projected to grow at 4.6% in 2023 and 4.2% in 2024. Growth momentum is slowing in 2024 as the region's potential is hindered by China's structural slowdown and weaker-than-expected economic recovery. China's economy bounced back in 2023 post-COVID, driven by domestic demand and supportive policies such as monetary relaxation, tax reliefs, and fiscal spending. However, growth is expected to slow to 4.6% in 2024 due to property sector weakness and falling external demand. Long-term growth is forecasted to decline to 3.5% by 2028 due to weak productivity and an aging population.\n\nAs interest rates remain higher, stress may lead to losses for smaller banks and an increasingly vulnerable real estate sector which is largely in debt. Hong Kong and Singapore have experienced substantial price declines in the real estate sector. On February 21, Forbes reported that Hong Kong's real estate sector faced its steepest downturn in two decades in 2023, with residential property prices dropping by 7%. Amid waning demand and rising interest rates, property developers slashed their prices by up to 20% to stimulate demand. Analysts anticipate further price declines in 2024, projecting an \"L-shaped\" recovery.\n\nMajor Players in the Asian Market\n\nSome of the major players, among the companies driving growth in Asia, are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) (NYSE:TSM), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNHY), Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM). Let's take a look at some latest updates from these companies.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNHY) is one of the world\u2019s leading technology companies in the world. On February 26, Samsung Electronics joined the AI-RAN Alliance, an organization aimed at revitalizing the convergence of AI and wireless communication for advanced 6G innovation by merging AI and wireless communication. Samsung aims to leverage the alliance to drive AI and wireless tech, leading 6G innovation.

The fundraise remains in progress but Alibaba and HongShan, formerly Sequoia China, have committed to the financing, one of the people said, asking not to be identified talking about a private deal. Deal terms could still change because negotiations with more investors are ongoing, the people added.\n\nAlibaba joins Silicon Valley peers like Microsoft Corp. in placing big bets on generative AI, the technology that powers ChatGPT.

Baidu, which in 2023 said its chatbot matched GPT in some respects, has also financed fledgling firms but largely focused on developing its in-house Ernie platform.\n\nApart from investing in technologies such as AI, Alibaba is also orchestrating a multi-way split intended to spur independent business lines from cloud to logistics.\n\nIt\u2019s trying to revive the cloud business and integrate AI and its in-house model \u2014 Tongyi Qianwen \u2014 across a sprawling business that also spans entertainment.

        "title": "Video game industry layoffs are a collision of trends",
        "content": "Thousands of video game industry workers are out of work following a series of mass layoffs at game developers and publishers over the past three months.\n\nSome 7,800 employees have been let go across companies ranging from Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SONY) to Unity (U) and Riot (TCEHY), according to the site Game Industry Layoffs, which tracks public layoff announcements. The moves echo the tech layoffs that pounded the industry in 2022, right down to the reason for at least some of the cuts: overexpansion during the pandemic gaming boom.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just poor corporate planning that set the industry on its current path. Broader forces ranging from a change in how consumers play games to where they access titles are impacting the gaming segment as well.\n\nAnd things might not take a turn for the better until 2025 when Rockstar (TTWO) debuts its highly anticipated \u201cGrand Theft Auto VI\u201d and Nintendo launches its successor to its Switch console.\n\n\u201cGetting from here to 2025 is the challenge right now,\u201d explained Mat Piscatella,executive director and video game industry analyst at Circana. \u201cAnd it's going be a tough road.\u201d\n\nA collision of trends\n\nThe layoffs hitting the gaming industry are largely the result of a handful of trends coalescing. The chief overarching issue comes down to publishers and developers overspending throughout 2021 and 2022.\n\n\u201cThere was a huge ramp-up in spending when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020,\u201d explained Lewis Ward, IDC research director of gaming, eSports, and VR/AR.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty much sustained through 2021, and I would say maybe the first half of 2022. Then things started to cool off.\u201d\n\nCompanies like Microsoft, Sony, and Embracer Group spent lavishly on acquisitions, with Embracer snagging \u201cBorderlands\u201d developer Gearbox Entertainment for $1.3 billion in 2021 while Microsoft picked up \u201cCall of Duty\u201d publisher Activision Blizzard for $69 billion and Sony grabbed \u201cDestiny\u201d maker Bungie for $3.6 billion in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the early portion of the pandemic, worldwide gaming industry revenue skyrocketed as people stuck inside looked for ways to pass the time. According to IDC, mobile game revenue shot up 32.8% to $99.9 billion in 2020, while digital PC and Mac game spending jumped 7.4% to 35.6 billion. Home console game spending, meanwhile, soared 33.9% to $42.9 billion.\n\nBut that growth declined quickly in the following years. Mobile gaming revenue growth fell 15% in 2021, then dropped to -3.3% in 2022 and -3.1% in 2023. PC and Mac game sales climbed again in 2021 by 8.7%, but growth collapsed by 1.4% in 2022 before a slight uptick of 2.1% in 2023. And after rocketing in 2020, console game spending stalled out in 2021, with growth sitting at 0.7%, before declining 3.4% in 2022 and returning to growth at 5.9% in 2023.

Couple that with higher interest rates, and the industry was set to come back down to Earth.\n\n\u201cThe projections that were made about future revenues in 2022 for 2023 and 2024 simply didn't materialize,\u201d Ward said. \u201cIt returned much more sharply to the pre-pandemic baseline than a lot of folks estimated.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just overspending that\u2019s costing gaming industry workers their jobs. The rise of mobile gaming among younger gamers means that as they grow, they\u2019ll spend more time playing on smartphones and tablets rather than consoles and PCs. Many of those titles are often free to play and easily accessible via app stores, rather than costing $60 to $70, explained Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 16 countries with most Chinese expats. If you do not want to learn about the dynamics of Chinese expatriation, head straight to the 5 Countries with Most Chinese Expats.\n\nWhen examining the global diaspora of Chinese nationals, certain countries like the USA and Thailand stand out as hubs for expatriates seeking opportunities abroad. These destinations attract Chinese expats for economic reasons and offer cultural, educational, and lifestyle opportunities. From bustling metropolises to serene landscapes, these countries provide diverse environments for Chinese expats to thrive and contribute to their host societies while maintaining ties with their homeland.\n\nExploring the Dynamics of the Chinese Immigration Market: Opportunities, Trends, and Impact\n\nThe global expat market, particularly the Chinese immigration market, presents significant economic opportunities for Chinese expats. Chinese immigrants are dispersed across various countries, with notable populations in Indonesia, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and Singapore. The Chinese diaspora amounts to 39.5 million individuals spread across 130 countries. Regarding financial statistics, China gradually opened to restricted forms of movement from abroad in 2022, with 4.47 million foreigners entering and exiting China that year. Notably, in 2022, 477,000 residence permits were issued to foreigners coming to China for various purposes such as work, family reunions, private affairs, and study.\n\nChinese immigrants in the United States are highly educated and often employed in management positions. They tend to obtain lawful permanent residence through work and have been a significant group among new green card holders in recent years. The United States is a top destination for Chinese immigrants globally. Additionally, China is the primary source of international students enrolled in U.S. higher education and received many employer-sponsored H-1B temporary visas in the fiscal year 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen it comes to immigration statistics for China, the number of immigrants has increased. For instance, in 2015, there were 978,046 immigrants in China, showing a 15.08% increase from 2010. These figures highlight the growing immigration trend both into and out of China.\n\nNavigating the Dynamics of Chinese Expatriation and Economic Impact: Trends, Challenges, and Strategies\n\nThe outmigration of Chinese citizens has significantly impacted economic growth in China and globally, and the early 21st century witnessed a surge in overseas Chinese returning to China, driven by the country's robust economy and abundant opportunities at home. This trend was further fueled by various government initiatives to attract overseas Chinese talent, such as the Thousand Talents Programme, which fostered entrepreneurship and innovation. Consequently, Chinese returnees have played a pivotal role in starting high-tech enterprises, introducing new management concepts, and revitalizing traditional industries, contributing significantly to China's economic development.\n\nChina's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 marked a turning point, leading to significant economic reforms that reshaped migration patterns. The boost in export-led manufacturing and domestic demand altered the landscape of emigration, with labor shortages no longer driving international migration. Instead, the allure of new opportunities within China led to increased diversification of emigration as more citizens obtained passports. Chinese emigrants have also facilitated global capital investments through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, impacting various industries globally.\n\nStudies indicate migration can have positive economic effects, including higher growth and productivity. For instance, a 1% increase in the migrant share in the adult population can result in a 2% higher GDP in the long run. Despite posing challenges such as social tensions, migration offers economic gains through increased productivity and labor market integration, benefiting both host and origin countries.\n\nHowever, China faces economic challenges stemming from demographic shifts and COVID-related disruptions. The country experienced a population decline in 2022, signaling demographic challenges that impact economic growth. With a shrinking labor force, China must focus on productivity to sustain its economy. Moreover, the economic growth rate dropped to 3% in 2022 due to COVID-related disruptions, marking a significant decline from previous years. To address these challenges, China aims to boost quality GDP growth through policy adjustments.\n\nThe trends in Chinese expatriation are influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, government policies, and societal changes. Understanding future trends in Chinese expatriation requires analyzing financial statistics and overseas development finance patterns.\n\nChinese overseas development finance has seen a downward trend in recent years, with a decrease in large-scale lending levels. This decline is evident in the number of new loan commitments totaling $10.5 billion in 2020 and 2021, the lowest in recent years. China's development finance is concentrated among top borrowers such as Angola, Argentina, and Brazil, mainly focusing on extraction, transport, and power.\n\nChina's financial system faces challenges, including financial repression and innovation constraints, which contribute to stagnant productivity growth. As seen in recent central financial work conferences, efforts to address these challenges include discussions emphasizing financial stability, risk management, and innovation support. China is also adapting its monetary and fiscal policies to support quality growth and structural reform amidst global economic challenges, focusing on upgrading the equity market to finance innovation and improve efficiency.\n\nTech Talent Dilemma: Returning Professionals Grapple with China's Work Culture\n\nChinese professionals returning to China after studying abroad encounter challenges related to work culture, work-life balance, and job opportunities. Despite efforts to attract tech talent amid a tech war with the US, many overseas Chinese tech workers are deterred by the intense work environment and lack of work-life balance in Chinese companies, influenced significantly by differences in work cultures between China and countries like the US. Some returning tech workers have faced layoffs and increased competition, especially in major tech firms like Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Tencent, contributing to concerns about youth unemployment rates in urban areas.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), a leading Chinese tech giant, contributes significantly to China's development with a $15.5 billion pledge by 2025 for innovation and economic support. However, concerns arise over its $2.5 million US lobbying expenditure and international expansion focusing on platforms like AliExpress. With Eddie Wu taking over as CEO in 2023, leadership changes reflect a strategic shift towards cloud intelligence amidst competitive markets, aiming to sustain Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)'s global tech leadership.\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), a major Chinese tech company founded by Robin Li in 2000, has significantly advanced China's technological landscape. With an 80% market share in China's search engine market and ranking as the world's fourth most popular website, Baidu has showcased China's tech capabilities globally. Its key contributions include technological innovation with a search engine rivaling Google, market dominance shaping information access in China, and strong brand recognition domestically and internationally.\n\nFinancially, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has experienced substantial growth, with total revenues and net income growing at high compound annual rates from 2008 to 2012, alongside steady growth in shareholders' equity. Fitch Ratings affirmed Baidu's 'A' rating with a stable outlook, highlighting its strong market position and robust cash generation from search and newsfeed services.\n\nTencent, a prominent Chinese tech company, has committed significant resources to philanthropy, pledging US$7.7 billion for 'shared prosperity' initiatives. Despite challenges, it remains a leader in digital donations in China. Financially, Tencent reported strong growth in Q2 2023, with revenues up 11% year-on-year to RMB149 billion ($20.6 billion) and net profits reaching RMB26.2 billion. Leveraging WeChat, Tencent focuses on high-quality revenue growth through features like Channels and mini-games, emphasizing innovation and sustainable development in the digital landscape.\n\nConsequently, some professionals are exploring job opportunities outside of China, including roles in cryptocurrency exchanges. The post-COVID era has seen changes in Chinese work culture, with a shift towards more flexible arrangements and remote positions being considered by some companies to adapt to evolving employee expectations. However, young graduates entering the job market face increased competition and may need help finding suitable positions, leading some to pursue alternative paths like working in family businesses or creating their jobs.  16 Countries with Most Chinese Expats\n\nCopyright: rawpixel / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nOur methodology entails ranking countries based on the total number of Chinese expatriates residing within them.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the top 20 languages with the hardest grammar for English speakers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can directly go to the Top 5 Languages with the Hardest Grammar for English Speakers.\n\nChinese as a Language\n\nArabic, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese are among the toughest languages for English speakers to learn, particularly due to their complex grammar, writing, and pronunciation systems. Moreover, Mandarin Chinese is also one of the most spoken native languages in the world. According to data from Ethnologue, it is spoken by over 1 billion speakers around the globe. Mandarin is also one of the most commonly spoken and official dialects of Chinese, spoken by approximately 80% of the Chinese population. According to the European Business Review, the influence of the Chinese language is growing steadily across the globe. In addition, Chinese language education is part of the national education system of over 70 countries, particularly in Southeast Asia and Africa. The growing influence of the Chinese language is attributed to China's economic power and the staggering number of Chinese speakers around the globe. You can look at the 17 Hardest Languages to Learn in the World for Non-English Speakers to read more about the hardest languages.\n\nEconomic Outlook of China\n\nChina is one of the largest economies in the world. According to a report by the World Trade Organization, China ranked 32nd on the list of the largest exporters 40 years ago and has shown significant growth since then. The Chinese economy has grown at the rate of 9.1% annually over the past four decades. As of 2024, China's GDP stands at $18.56 trillion. Furthermore, based on purchasing power parity, China boasts one of the world's largest shares of global GDP, at 19.05%.\n\nRegarding GDP growth, the Chinese economy experienced slower-than-usual GDP growth of 3.2% in 2022. The slower growth is attributed to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, a decline in the housing market, and sporadic outbreaks of COVID-19. According to a report by the Bank of China, the GDP growth rates for 2023 were projected to be 3.6%, 5.3%, and 6.6%, based on pessimistic, baseline, and optimistic expectations. Moreover, 2023 was also marked as the first year of implementation of the strategic plan presented by the 20th CPC National Congress. Although the investment growth rates were expected to remain low for 2023, the fallout from COVID-19, recovering consumption rates, and pro-growth policies helped stabilize the economy.

With this context, let's look at the top 20 languages with the hardest grammar for English speakers. Top 20 Languages with the Hardest Grammar for English Speakers\n\nA close up macro image of someone using a mobile device to learn a new language.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the top 20 languages with the hardest grammar for English speakers, we used the Foreign Services Institute data on Foreign Language Training. Foreign Services Institute categorizes languages into 4 broad categories based on the number of class hours required to learn a language. For this article, we used Category 3 and Category 4, which require 1,100 and 2,200 class hours for English speakers to learn.\n\nThe Foreign Services Institute does not give individual rankings for the languages. Therefore, we employed a consensus methodology to rank our languages. We shifted through the rankings of Berlitz, Busuu, Southwest Journal, Mango Languages, Far and Wide, and Solo Lingual to get a list of 40 languages with the hardest grammar for English speakers. We selected only those languages that belonged to Category 3 and Category 4 of the Foreign Services Institute data and appeared in at least 3 of our sources. Next, we ranked these languages based on their average rank among our sources. We used the number of mentions as a tie-breaker for instances where two or more languages had the same rank.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "Tuhu Car, a Chinese car maintenance and repair company listed in Hong Kong, said it expects its financial results for 2023 to reflect a turnaround in its business as a post-pandemic rebound in domestic travel boosted demand for its services.\n\nThe Shanghai-based company expects to record a net profit of \"no less than 450 million yuan (US$62.53 million)\" for last year, it said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) on Friday. That would represent a turnaround from a loss of 551.9 million yuan in 2022.\n\nWhen extraordinary gains are taken into account, including the premium arising from the forced conversion of convertible preferred notes in its IPO last year, Tuhu expects earnings to have surged to at least 6.6 billion yuan (US$917.8 million), versus a 2.1 billion yuan loss in 2022.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"All our convertible redeemable preferred shares were converted to class A ordinary shares upon completion of our initial public offering and therefore we will not incur fair value changes of convertible redeemable preferred shares thereafter,\" it said in the filing.\n\nTuhu, which is backed by Chinese internet giant Tencent, said an increase in demand for tyre changes and other vehicle maintenance services in the past year had driven the turnaround in its fortunes.\n\nTourism in China has been recovering since December 2022, when the country's zero-Covid policy was dropped, with the number of domestic trips last year returning to about 80 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLast year, more Chinese tourists favoured exploring nearby cities or opting for short-distance local tours to destinations within the cities they live, according to a December report published by the China Tourism Academy (CTA), a research institution under the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.\n\nStory continues\n\nTuhu said it had also benefited from a growing customer base, more favourable terms from suppliers as it improved its economy of scale, better margins as a result of an enhanced product mix, and better operational efficiency.\n\nThe company raised US$152 million in its Hong Kong initial public offering in September, having priced its shares at the low end of the range flagged to investors, Reuters reported at the time. The international tranche of Tuhu's IPO was 2.3 times oversubscribed, while retail demand was 2.67 times the number of shares on offer.\n\nTuhu had initially wanted to list in New York but changed its plan to Hong Kong, where it had originally sought to raise about US$400 million, a person familiar with the situation told the Post in August 2022.\n\nIt was one of many Chinese firms that made the switch to list in Hong Kong as relations between Washington and Beijing deteriorated.\n\nThe start-up was founded by Chen Min in Shanghai in 2011 and offers a wide range of services online and in stores for car owners ranging from tyres, battery and chassis replacement parts to other car maintenance and repair services, according to its stock exchange filings.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "25 Largest Economies in the World by 2100",
        "content": "In this article, we will look into the 25 largest economies in the world by 2100. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Largest Economies in the World by 2100.\n\nGlobal Economic Prospects\n\nThe global economy presents sluggish near-term progress, with the ongoing geopolitical crises and enduring effects of the pandemic. Climate change is another major factor, leading to resource and economic losses due to significant changes in its trajectory. However, the future predictions paint a rather hopeful picture for the global economy. In 2024, the global economy is expected to grow at 3.1% and is expected to grow at 3.2% in 2025, according to the latest economic outlook by the IMF. The recent forecasts are slightly higher than the previously estimated GDP growth in the October 2023 economic outlook. This can be attributed to the strong performance depicted by several countries such as the United States, and policy interventions such as fiscal support in China. The forecast, however, is still below the historical growth average of 3.8%. Inflation is expected to decrease faster than expected and reach 5.8% in 2024, and 4.4% in 2025. This downtrend in inflation, coupled with steady growth, minimizes the risk of a severe economic downturn. The declining inflation presents an opportunity for countries to shift their focus toward fiscal consolidation and targeted policies to improve productivity and long-term growth. Despite the resilient growth projections, several challenges can affect this trajectory, such as a declining population growth rate. The projected population represents a substantial slowdown, compared to previous decades. This shift is expected to impact economic growth, along with factors such as weakened productivity, as predicted by economists.\n\nOn the contrary, the long-term outlook paints a rather stable picture, especially for Asian economies. According to the forecast by Fathom Consulting, Asian economies such as China and India are expected to lead the global economy with the highest GDP share. The report forecasts China to have a share of 22.68% and reach $101 trillion by 2100. Moreover, Asian countries such as Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines are some other nations, that are expected to emerge as global leaders, in terms of GDP. These countries are also ranked among the largest economies in the world by 2050.\n\nStory continues\n\nRole of Companies in Driving Economy\n\nThe long-term economic landscape presents the potential supremacy of Asian nations such as China and India, along with the established influence of the US. While these macroeconomic trends provide us with a broader picture of the economy, it is pertinent to acknowledge the crucial role that major corporations play in these countries and around the world. Among other factors, businesses across major economic regions are a driver of growth globally. Leading companies such as Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Reliance Industries Ltd (NSE:RELIANCE) are some of the most valuable companies from the biggest countries in the world.\n\nTencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) is a technology leader in China, operating across Asia and the Pacific, North America, and Europe. The company's stock has surged nearly 8% over the past month, as of February 21. The company has a diverse portfolio of brands including Tencent Pictures, WeiShi, QQ Wallet, Q Zone, QQ Browser, Weixin/WeChat, and QQMail. As of February 21, Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) has a market cap of $349.4 billion.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an established leader in the global market, boasting a market cap of $1.78 trillion, as of February 21. The company reported its earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 on January 30. It reported earnings per share of $1.64, beating the estimates by $0.04. Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) revenue for the quarter amounted to $86.31 billion and outperformed estimates by $1.03 billion, with a year-over-year increase of over 13%.\n\nReliance Industries Ltd (NSE:RELIANCE) is one of the most valuable Indian companies, boasting a market cap of $240 billion, as of February 21. The company is home to 170 in-store brands and has millions of customers all over the country. On January 19, Reliance Industries Ltd (NSE:RELIANCE) announced its results for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. The company reported gross revenue of $29.8 billion, with a 3.2% year-over-year increase. Reliance Industries Ltd (NSE:RELIANCE) also witnessed a growth of 11.4% and 22.8% in its Jio Platforms division and Reliance Retail Ventures Limited.\n\nNow, let's have a look at the 25 largest economies in the world by 2100. 25 Largest Economies in the World by 2100\n\n25 Largest Economies in the World by 2100\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 25 largest economies in the world by 2100, we consulted 'Economics in the Year 2100' by Fathom. It provides data for the estimated percentage share of countries in the global GDP in 2100. It also reports the GDP PPP of the top ten economies. We utilized the data for the GDP PPP value of the top countries and percentage share to calculate the total global GDP value in 2100. Our calculation yielded that the global GDP is projected to be approximately $449 trillion by 2100. After calculating the global GDP in US dollars, we estimated the GDP PPP for the countries to provide insight into their projected values. Our list ranks the 25 largest economies in the world by 2100 in ascending order of their GDP share. We used the population projections for 2100, by the UN, as a tie-breaker for the countries with the same percent contribution to the global economy in 2100.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "Which were the most used apps during Lunar New Year? Familiar names like Tencent and ByteDance dominated top 5",
        "content": "The most used apps in China during the Lunar New Year holiday were familiar domestic social media and content platforms that have dominated the market for the past decade, according to government data.\n\nAmong the apps that used the most cellular data during the nine-day holiday were Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok owned by ByteDance, Tencent Holdings' super app WeChat, China's second-largest short video platform Kuaishou, Tencent Video and Jinri Toutiao, the news aggregator that also belongs to ByteDance.\n\nThese apps combined used more than 75 per cent of mobile data during the period, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nTencent and ByteDance each had two apps in the top five. Four of the top five apps have a history of more than 10 years, with the youngest app being Douyin, which was launched almost eight years ago. This is the first time that the MIIT has released a top-five app ranking for the holiday period.\n\nIn 2021, a report issued by the MIIT for the Lunar New Year period revealed that the volume of virtual red packets sent via digital wallet Alipay soared 270 per cent. Alipay is operated by Ant Group, a fintech affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, which also owns the Post. In 2019, online marketplace JD.com saw its sales grow nearly 43 per cent during the holiday.\n\nAlibaba created Alipay in 2004, whereas JD.com was established in 1998.\n\n\"It seems increasingly difficult to see phenomenal new apps emerging in the internet market\", said Guo Tao, a Beijing-based angel investor, adding that the market is saturated with users resistant to change.\n\nGuo said that if a breakthrough app does emerge in the near future, it is likely to involve artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT) or extended reality, an umbrella term that covers virtual and augmented reality.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, some of the dominant apps are going through change, with WeChat - originally a messaging app - betting big on short video with its in-app WeChat Channels, and Douyin setting out ambitious goals for e-commerce.\n\nAfter achieving a gross merchandise volume (GMV) of 2.2 trillion yuan (US$305.7 billion) in 2023, Douyin's online shopping channel aims to grow this to 3 trillion yuan, according to Chinese media LatePost.\n\nDouyin is focused on low pricing as a priority for the year, placing it in head-to-head competition with Pinduoduo, PDD Holdings' flagship app in China for budget-conscious consumers, the report said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "15 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 biggest cloud providers by market share in 2024. We have also discussed the latest revenue and growth of top cloud providers. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in 2024.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has fueled a rapid shift towards cloud adoption, with projections indicating that global spending on cloud services and related components will exceed $1.0 trillion in 2024, maintaining a CAGR of 15.7%.\n\nMoreover, the global cloud services market is witnessing major growth, with a projected value of $2.19 trillion by 2032, with a CAGR of 17.10% from 2023. In 2022, North America held a dominant market share of 42%, driven by a strong emphasis on digitalization, particularly in sectors like IoT, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence. Large enterprises accounted for 52% of the market share in 2022, reflecting their investment in cloud solutions for enhanced agility and efficiency.\n\nThe market is segmented by deployment, with private clouds leading in 2022 with a share of over 47%, offering organizations greater control and security. However, hybrid clouds are expected to witness rapid growth, driven by SMEs adopting cloud-based solutions for productivity enhancement and cost reduction. Software as a Service (SaaS) dominated the market in 2022 due to its ease of deployment and cost-effectiveness, while Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is projected to grow rapidly, fueled by the demand for hybrid cloud platforms and robust data storage solutions.\n\nIn terms of region, Asia Pacific is anticipated to experience exponential growth, fueled by increasing demand from sectors such as manufacturing and healthcare. Additionally, key market developments, such as collaborations between companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), underscore the growing importance of cloud technology in revolutionizing different industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, AI-as-a-Service is democratizing AI through cloud platforms, enabling businesses to harness transformative technologies without heavy investment. Leveraging vast compute power and data, AI models like ChatGPT are trained, offering economic and social benefits. Predicted to rise from 76% to 85%, multi-cloud strategies provide cost and flexibility advantages but pose challenges in data governance and integration.\n\nHybrid cloud solutions combining on-premises infrastructure with cloud services are also gaining popularity, allowing organizations to balance security and flexibility. In 2024, real-time cloud infrastructure is becoming equally vital, as organizations are prioritizing up-to-the-minute insights over stale data. Streamed data consumption is also on the rise, emphasizing the need for instant access storage like Flash and solid-state devices. This shift accommodates trends such as cloud gaming and streamed entertainment from platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT), indicating a growing demand for real-time data handling capabilities.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (CGP) are the top three cloud providers in the world in 2024.\n\nOn the financial end, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s cloud division, AWS, witnessed a revenue growth of 13% year over year, hitting $24.20 billion, meeting analysts' expectations precisely. This growth was attributed to the increasing adoption of cloud services for artificial intelligence, with AWS introducing products like the Q chatbot and the Trainium2 chip. Despite this growth, AWS faced stiff competition from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Azure and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Cloud, which saw revenue increases of 30% and 26%, respectively. However, AWS maintained its position as a major contributor to Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s\u00a0 overall revenue, representing 14% of the company's total earnings.\n\nOperating income for AWS in the fourth quarter stood at $7.17 billion, surpassing StreetAccount's consensus by approximately 38%. This stable performance further solidified AWS's continued profitability and dominance in the cloud services market. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s decision to extend the useful life of its servers to six years is projected to bolster first-quarter operating income by $900 million.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Azure cloud platform is rapidly gaining ground on Amazon Web Services (AWS), with analysts estimating Azure to now be about three-quarters the size of its top competitor, compared to being only half its size five years ago. Much of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s recent success can be to its strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Revenue growth in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Azure and cloud services division is being largely boosted by AI, with 6 points of revenue growth attributed to AI in the latest period. This growth outpaces AWS, with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure\u2019s revenue increasing by 30% compared to AWS's 13% year-over-year growth.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s investment in AI isn't just limited to software; they're also integrating AI capabilities into their cloud infrastructure, including the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) for running AI models. Their collaboration with OpenAI, including technologies like GPT-4, has attracted a considerable number of Azure AI customers.\n\nTo read more about cloud companies, see Top 20 Cloud Computing Companies in USA. 15 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in 2024\n\nA team of software developers gathered around a monitor discussing a new CRM platform.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the biggest cloud providers by market share in 2024, we utilized the market share value of big cloud companies based on their Q4 2023 revenue from their respective cloud segments.

        "content": "A version of this article was first published by The Korea Times in a partnership with the South China Morning Post.\n\nSouth Korea's major video gaming companies see bright prospects for their operations in mainland China on the back of recently granted licences, according to industry insiders and analysts, after grappling with a regulatory crackdown and geopolitical risks in the market over the past few years.\n\nTitles from Nexon, NCSoft Corp and Netmarble Corp - the top three game publishers in South Korea - were among the latest imports approved for commercial release on the mainland, the world's largest video gaming market. These included Nexon's Dungeon & Fighter (DnF) Mobile and Netmarble's The King of Fighters All Star on February 2, and NCSoft's Blade & Soul 2 last December.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nWith at least 18 Korean video games licensed for release on the mainland since late 2022, those top developers are betting big that China's openness would continue and enable more titles in future to be enjoyed by gamers on the mainland, according to industry insiders and analysts.\n\nVideo gaming companies \"would naturally prefer [to get licences for] products already with proven performance and achievements [overseas]\", according to a report by Shanghai-based video gaming industry research site GameLook, which referred to the strict control on the number of imports released in the market.\n\nDungeon & Fighter Mobile, part of the role-playing game franchise first published by Nexon in 2005, will be operated in mainland China by Tencent Holdings. Photo: Handout alt=Dungeon & Fighter Mobile, part of the role-playing game franchise first published by Nexon in 2005, will be operated in mainland China by Tencent Holdings. Photo: Handout>\n\nStory continues\n\nSouth Korean video game imports already represent a \"a bright spot in the market\", the GameLook report said.\n\nAt least nine major Korean games were released on the mainland from June to September last year, generating more than 3 billion yuan (US$417 million) in total revenue as of October, according to GameLook.\n\nThe National Press and Publication Administration, the agency in charge of licensing video games in China, on February 2 published a list of 32 imported titles approved for release, which included side-scrolling action role-playing game DnF Mobile to be operated in the domestic market by Tencent Holdings.\n\nSeven Korean titles - including Lost Ark by Smilegate, Nexon's MapleStory M and Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds by Netmarble - were among the first batch of 44 imports licensed for release on the mainland in December 2022 since a regulatory crackdown in the industry.\n\nNetmarble Corp's Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is a mobile game that is part of the Ni no Kuni series that was introduced in 2010. Photo: Handout alt=Netmarble Corp's Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is a mobile game that is part of the Ni no Kuni series that was introduced in 2010. Photo: Handout>\n\nThe recent approvals, according to industry insiders, signalled that China has eased its restrictions on South Korean video game imports.\n\nBefore December 2022, there were only two South Korean games that received licences on the mainland in the six years since March 2017.\n\nIn 2017, Beijing started its ban on South Korean cultural imports, including new video games, in retaliation against Seoul's deployment of a US anti-missile system. That came after Seoul's February 2016 decision to restart talks with Washington over deploying the US-developed Terminal High Altitude Area Defence System to neutralise missile threats from North Korea.\n\nFor a long time, China had been South Korea's largest export market for video games. In 2012, the mainland accounted for more than 38 per cent of South Korea's game exports.\n\nAmong the latest batch of foreign game imports approved for release on the mainland, DnF Mobile came as a surprise.\n\nIn collaboration with Tencent, Nexon originally planned an earlier release of DnF Mobile in China. The mainland launch of the mobile game, which was first released in South Korea in 2022, was suddenly cancelled in August 2020 even though it had more than 60 million pre-reservations at the time.\n\nTencent, which runs the world's largest video gaming business by revenue, and partner Nexon cited the need to make adjustments based on regulatory requirements.\n\nDnF Mobile was adapted from Nexon's flagship personal computer game Dungeon & Fighter, which was released in August 2005. This franchise has since become one of the world's highest-grossing video games, with more than US$22 billion in lifetime revenue as of June 2023.\n\nA team of DnF Mobile designers said last Tuesday via the game's official WeChat account that a new round of testing will start at the end of this month, showing that \"our preparations have finally entered a new stage\".\n\nDnF Mobile has raised expectations in China's gaming community, with many players expressing their excitement about its regulatory approval on social media. At the same time, analysts have also indicated that the game's release in China will help boost revenue for partners Tencent and Nexon.\n\nNexon, for example, already said that the growth of flagship DnF desktop game and MapleStory: The Legends of Maple on the mainland helped it achieve record-breaking revenue in 2023.\n\nIt is believed that more foreign games will be approved for release in China after Beijing showed its support for the industry when it scrapped a proposed regulation that wiped out billions of dollars of value from Chinese video gaming stocks in December.\n\nMany of the recently approved South Korean games are also part of popular franchises that are generally favoured in the mainland market.\n\nSome analysts, however, noted that it could also pose a challenge to introduce old franchises, compared with newer, more advanced video games in China.\n\nFor older franchises like DnF, \"obtaining a licence is more about using existing resources\", said Zhang Shule, an analyst with CBJ Think Tank. \"Its gameplay and concept lag behind the times, and it would be even harder to entice [more] players to pay for the game based solely on emotional connection.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for the Upcoming AI Wars",
        "content": "Last month, the writers at InvestorPlace.com and I recommended four stocks to buy for the coming \u201cAI Wars.\u201d Governments worldwide know that artificial intelligence has incredible potential, and everyone is racing to come out ahead.\n\nThe United Kingdom has promised to pour $1.3 billion over the next five years into AI and supercomputing, while China will put in double that amount. If you include government subsidies of chip factories (the most capital-intensive part of AI investment), roughly $120 billion has now been pledged.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing the effects of this new AI nationalism. Since January, shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) \u2014 one of the four stocks we highlighted last week \u2014 have surged 45% on strong fourth-quarter earnings. The secretive company specializes in helping corporations and governments eke out AI-driven insights from mounds of data. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of Louis Navellier\u2019s top picks, has risen 45% since the start of the year after tripling the prices of its AI-focused H100 flagship processors. U.K.-based AI chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is up almost 60% after earnings\u2026 the list goes on.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn other words, these companies are raising prices and creating monopolies\u2026 and governments are happy to allow it.\n\nOf course, some AI stocks will take time to play out. Last Friday, shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) (another of our four picks from last week) fell 12% after the chipmaker announced a weaker-than-expected forecast. It will likely take one or two more years for Intel to see the benefits of the billion-dollar subsidies the U.S. government is providing.\n\nNevertheless, this much is clear: When governments and investors all want a sector to succeed, the combination of supporting tariffs, subsidies and lax regulation can often make it so. We\u2019ve seen this before in other industries\u2026 from shale oil and gas drilling in the Dakotas to electric vehicle production in China\u2019s Anhui province. Once a state begins putting its thumb on the scale, those favored industries have little choice but to succeed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis week, Luke Lango reveals another group of stocks in The AI Endgame. During that event, Luke will tell us all about the final phase of the AI Revolution, which could send several unknown stocks soaring to new heights\u2026 while simultaneously erasing thousands of stocks from the markets. You can sign up to reserve your spot for that event \u2014 Tuesday, Feb. 13, at 8 p.m. Eastern \u2014 here.\n\nAnd in the meantime, our writers here at InvestorPlace.com have chosen three blue-chip stocks to help keep you ahead as these AI Wars continue to escalate.\n\n3 Blue Chip AI Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerhaps the clearest potential winner of AI nationalism will be Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google. The company launched its answer to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT on Wednesday, and our initial tests suggest it\u2019s even better than GPT-4.\n\nThis comes as much-needed good news for the search giant. Digital ad revenues have been slowing for years, and Google has become increasingly reliant on its cloud computing business for growth. A strong showing by its new AI product \u2014 Google Gemini \u2014 will help it push past rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It\u2019s one of the reasons why David Moadel, one of InvestorPlace\u2019s top contributors, believes that Alphabet is a Mag 7 bargain:\n\n\u201cThere no denying that Alphabet is committed to developing the latest and greatest in AI tech\u2026 [and] agree with Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali, who asserts that Alphabet \u201cremains at the forefront of the AI race.\u201d All three of the analysts mentioned here assigned a \u201cbuy\u201d rating to GOOG/GOOGL stock.\n\n\u201cMy forecast GOOG stock is 100% bullish and I encourage investors to grab some shares before the next long-term rally commences.\u201d\n\nAI nationalism is also particularly important for Alphabet because it has the most to gain from lax regulation. Google has the broadest access to online data of any major tech firm, having indexed the web for the past 25 years. Many publishers also give Google the ability to \u201ccrawl\u201d content behind paywalled sites \u2014 a privilege that virtually no other firm has.\n\nThat makes Google the most likely company to beat ChatGPT \u2014 provided it can use the data it\u2019s collected. Studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) continue improving as more training data is added. So, a hands-off approach by regulators will be essential to helping Google win.\n\nOf course, other American blue-chips will also benefit from favorable regulation. Export restrictions to China will eventually turn into import restrictions, protecting companies like Nvidia from cheaper Chinese rivals. Microsoft and Amazon will both find themselves protected from trustbusters because regulators recognize that AI is only as good as the massive amounts of data it hoovers up.\n\nBut AI will benefit Google the most, given the company\u2019s awkward reliance on a slowing search business and the amount of data it has. Alphabet is also the cheapest of the Magnificent 7 stocks, trading at only 21 times forward earnings. If the company manages to beat OpenAI, a renewed surge of growth gives the search giant a 50% to 60% upside from here.\n\n2. ASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nLast year was a tough time to own ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the world\u2019s only producer of advanced chipmaking machinery. The Netherlands-based company had found itself caught in the China-U.S. fight over chip export restrictions, and shares lost as much as 25% going into the fall. Regulators knew that ASML served as the lynchpin of advanced semiconductor manufacturing, so they banned sales of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) chipmaking machinery to kneecap China\u2019s growing chipmaking business.\n\nHowever, Western governments have since realized that choking off ASML\u2019s business entirely is a bad idea. Roughly a quarter of ASML\u2019s total operating costs come from its R&D department, and ASML needs to keep innovating to stay ahead of the competition. Subsequent export restrictions have since been watered down to include only the latest models.\n\nThat\u2019s had a predictable effect on earnings estimates and share prices. Analysts have been nudging their 2024-2025 estimates up across the board, and shares have risen over 50% since October. It\u2019s why InvestorPlace.com\u2019s Chris MacDonald continues to recommend shares of this impressive firm.\n\n\u201cASML\u2019s top position in EUV technology is critical for semiconductor advancement, especially in advanced memory solutions. CEO Peter Wennink maintained a humble outlook despite positive signs of a 2024 revenue similar to the previous year. The company sets eyes for significant growth in 2025.\u201d\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany Chinese firms will win thanks to AI nationalism. The Chinese government has a $40 billion state fund to boost the semiconductor industry, and dozens of chipmaking firms have sprung up to take advantage of the handouts. Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor, Nexchip Semiconductor and United Nova are among these names.\n\nHowever, the \u201csafest\u201d of Chinese AI plays is most likely Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), a monopolistic software giant with few strong competitors. Unlike Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Tencent has remained on the right side of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Its CEO has never \u201cdisappeared\u201d for months on end. And Tencent has been far better managed than Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), China\u2019s top search-engine company, which failed to recognize opportunities in cloud computing. Tencent has masterfully navigated M&A deals across the greater China region, earning north of 20% returns.\n\nMost importantly, Tencent has no stake in the cut-throat world of semiconductor manufacturing. The company focuses on mobile games, online chat, enterprise businesses, music streaming and other high-margin tech services that AI will make even more profitable. Analysts expect the firm to earn 30% operating margins going into 2024. (SMIC, by comparison, barely covers its cost of capital.)\n\nThe Chinese tech giant also has significant exposure to cloud computing, business services, and fintech, which fits neatly into its AI ambitions. In 2022, this segment eclipsed its gaming sales, and analysts see this as a significant growth area for the next several years. Josh Enomoto at InvestorPlace.com sees at least 34% upside from current prices, while a successful pivot to AI would mean even more.\n\nOf course, Tencent comes with the broader risks of buying Chinese stocks. The country has recently seen an exodus of investors, driven out by fears of real estate contagion and a rapidly decelerating economy. The tech firm also remains beholden to the whims of the CCP; in December, Tencent\u2019s shares fell double-digits after Chinese regulators announced a wide range of rules aimed at curbing spending on video games. (The CCP would later fire a top government official over the resulting market meltdown, sending Tencent\u2019s shares back up.)\n\nStill, Paul La Monica sees this most recent drawdown as an opportunity to buy Chinese shares cheaply. He notes that insiders have recently snapped up shares.\n\n\u201cThe reported stock purchases by Ma and Tsai are certainly a sign of confidence and could suggest that Alibaba and the overall Chinese stock market have bottomed. Investors are also growing increasingly optimistic about the possibility of more stimulus from Beijing. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that a nearly $280 billion market stabilization package is in the works, where state-owned financial companies would buy up local shares of Chinese stocks.\u201d\n\nAnd now that even Chinese President Xi Jinping is attempting to calm investors, this likely marks as the best time in years to buy shares of Tencent.\n\nThe New AI Wars\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve talked about the large companies helped by direct government intervention. These are essentially the equivalent of the South Korean family-run conglomerates (chaebol), or the eight conglomerates of Japan. Dependable and protected\u2026 but with somewhat limited upside because of their size.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke has ventured further to find the secondary winners of this new AI reality. Though his research, he\u2019s found incredible growth companies that are leading innovation, even without much government help. Many of these firms could even rival the big players someday. And to get you started, Luke releases a new report this week that outlines five 1,000% winners for The AI Endgame.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The head of ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s China operations is stepping down, a week after Chief Executive Officer Liang Rubo said the company needed to avoid complacency and make up lost ground in the AI race.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals Court Xi to Discuss China Stocks With Regulators as Rescue Bets Build Wall Street Snubs China for India in a Historic Markets Shift \u2018Money Dysmorphia\u2019 Traps Millennials and Gen Zers King Charles Treated for Cancer in New Royal Health Scare\n\nKelly Zhang is relinquishing the post of Douyin Group CEO, a ByteDance spokesperson said on Wednesday, confirming an earlier report in Chinese media. She took on the role in 2020, sharing responsibilities with ByteDance China Chairman Zhang Lidong. ByteDance will not seek to appoint a successor and Kelly Zhang will shift her focus to the video-editing app CapCut, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named as the plans are private.\n\nBeijing-based ByteDance, the owner of short-video platforms TikTok and Douyin, needs to adopt a sense of crisis and steer clear of mediocrity, Liang told staff in a companywide meeting at the end of January. He said he saw several organizational problems that needed to be addressed and lamented ByteDance falling behind in the artificial intelligence race kickstarted by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cAI technology will greatly disrupt content creation and even lead to new creative tools. We hope to actively explore, fully understand and seize the opportunities,\u201d Liang wrote in a memo to staff announcing Kelly Zhang\u2019s move, reviewed by Bloomberg. He attributed the decision mainly to business development needs and said Han Shangyou, who previously reported to Kelly Zhang, will continue running day-to-day operations at Douyin and report to Zhang Lidong.\n\nRead More: ByteDance CEO Warns Staff Against Mediocrity After Slow AI Start\n\nKelly Zhang joined ByteDance in 2014 and was one of the few prominent women in leadership posts among China\u2019s biggest tech firms. In her position, she oversaw ByteDance\u2019s products and operations domestically, including Douyin and news aggregator Toutiao. Outside of China, the TikTok business is headed up by Singaporean Shou Chew, who was one of the social media CEOs grilled by US senators last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nKelly Zhang\u2019s exit leaves some uncertainty at the top of a platform she helped build into an e-commerce and content force. Douyin started out as a repository for short videos but rapidly grew into an online shopping and social media leader, creating the template for ByteDance\u2019s TikTok Shop overseas. The service is now challenging Tencent Holdings Ltd.\u2019s WeChat for advertising, forcing the larger company to refocus on its own video initiatives, and eroding Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s market share in online shopping.\n\n\u201cKelly Zhang\u2019s performance at Douyin speaks for itself and has led to impressive achievements, so this is definitely not a question of her ability,\u201d said Li Chengdong, head of Beijing-based think tank Haitun. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be much impact as their business has already become institutionalized. Douyin is already an industry leader.\u201d\n\nLong hailed as the world\u2019s most valuable startup, ByteDance now rivals Chinese internet pioneers like Tencent, with sales surpassing $110 billion last year. TikTok is also the first non-gaming app to bring in more than $10 billion in user spending over its lifetime.\n\n\u201cI am excited to work together with the team members at CapCut to create our own dreams, and to grow in this AI era to draw a fantasy world together,\u201d Zhang wrote in a social media post. \u201cI will continue to use this entrepreneurial mindset to work hard for the next 10 years at the things I am passionate about.\u201d\n\n(Updates with CEO letter to staff and further details on ByteDance plans)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About The Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

        "content": "Chinese video game live-streaming platform Douyu denied recent reports that it would finally be merging with main rival Huya - both backed by Tencent Holdings - but acknowledged the two firms are working together in some areas, according to local media reports.\n\nDouyu said on Monday that there are no merger plans between the two companies, according to The Paper, an online news organisation under state-backed Shanghai United Media Group. The fresh rumours have emerged more than three years after regulators quashed a planned merger of the country's two largest game live-streaming platforms orchestrated by Tencent.\n\nThe denial also came a day after Douyu and Huya jointly launched an online gala, which airs on February 6 and 7, featuring singing, dancing and other performances by influencers and live-streamers from both platforms.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nDouyu and Huya did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\n\nIn January 2019, a court ruling in Tencent's favour blocked ByteDance from being able to stream the games on its platforms, including Douyin and Xigua Video. That made Douyu and Huya the premier destinations for such content.\n\nAnalysts say the new agreement with ByteDance bodes ill for the Tencent-backed streamers.\n\n\"It means Douyu and Huya are losing their advantages in the game live-streaming area,\" said Zhang Shule, game sector analyst at consultancy CBJ Think Tank. \"If [they] fail to find new monetisation sources ... it'll just be a matter of time for their retreat from the stage.\"\n\nZhang added that even without a merger, the two firms are supposed to be collaborating with each other rather than competing.\n\nAmid shrinking revenue in recent years, both Douyu and Huya have lost the early momentum that made them the dominant Twitch-like platforms in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuya posted 9.2 billion yuan (US$1.3 billion) in revenue in 2022, down 19 per cent year on year. Douyu's net revenue also tumbled nearly 22 per cent to 7.1 billion yuan that year.\n\nWhen Tencent attempted to merge the platforms in 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation killed the plan on concerns of monopolistic practices. At the time, Douyu and Huya controlled a combined 70 per cent of the video game live-streaming market.\n\nBy 2021, Douyin had nearly 87 per cent of top live-streaming gamers on its platform while Huya had about 20 per cent and Douyu had 13 per cent, according to an analysis by TalkingData.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "By Josh Ye\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Tencent Holdings has been working to adapt acclaimed action role-playing console game \"Elden Ring\" into a mobile version, three people familiar with the matter said, as it searches for a new hit to refresh its ageing stock of games.\n\nThe world's largest gaming company by revenue acquired the licensing rights for the game by FromSoftware in 2022 and set up a team of a few dozen people to work on a prototype, the same year it bought a 16% stake in the Japanese game maker, the people said. But progress has been slow, they added.\n\nTencent did not disclose its plans to develop a mobile version of the game at the time. \"Elden Ring\" was co-developed by \"Game of Thrones\" author George R. R. Martin and veteran game designer Hidetaka Miyazaki and is an action game where one battles mythical monsters in a fantasy world.\n\nThe game, released in 2022 for $60, sold about 20 million copies in its first year, making it the world's second best-selling game for the year. Its fans include billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nWhile \"Elden Ring\" was designed as a premium game with a set price tag, Tencent wants to make it a free-to-play game with in-app purchases, similar to the hit game \"Genshin Impact\" developed by its Chinese rival miHoYo, the people said.\n\nBut the design of \"Elden Ring\", which focuses on a complete experience after a one-time purchase, is at odds with Tencent's planned model.\n\nTencent and FromSoftware did not respond to requests for comment. The sources declined to be named as they were not permitted to speak to media.\n\nTencent has previously encountered issues with adapting big console games for smartphones. It axed a project based on the popular \"Nier\" franchise in December over monetization concerns.\n\nTencent has in the past year become more conservative in pursuing a game based on another company's franchise as growth in the gaming market plateaus and hefty royalty fee can leave a game barely profitable.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeijing's opaque game approval system may also leave a finished game hanging for months, if not years, before release.\n\nStill urgency for Tencent to find a new hit is growing, with its chairman saying that its gaming business was under threat.\n\nWhile Tencent's past hits such as \"PUBG Mobile\" continue to deliver strong revenue, more recent products have fallen short of expectations.\n\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Brenda Goh and Himani Sarkar)",

        "title": "High-Risk, High-Reward: 7 OTC Stocks That Could Make You Rich This Year",
        "content": "I cannot stress enough how risky OTC stocks or securities traded over the counter really are. For one thing, just the name OTC should ring some alarm bells. This designation means that these securities don\u2019t trade on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Instead, they trade via broker-dealer networks. And not all stock platforms support what\u2019s otherwise known as the pink sheets.\n\nSecond, many investors are shocked to discover the administrative costs tied to OTC stocks. Yes, many of these securities are \u201ccheap,\u201d trading hands at unit prices well below a buck. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s cheap to you. Wide bid-ask spreads may mean that your holdings may have to rise significantly higher to be net profitable. Also, even if you are profitable, low trading volume could mean a long time to find a buyer.\n\nAt the same time, OTC stocks or otherwise highly speculative shares can fly higher. Some examples include the following:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMonster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST): In 1997, you could have had MNST for just two cents. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): On a split-adjusted basis, you could have bought AAPL for 10 cents in December 1980. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD): Back in June 2015, AMD traded for below $2.\n\nOf course, there are way more failures than successes. But if you want to go for gold, below are the OTC stocks to consider.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nA Chinese multinational technology conglomerate, Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has had a rough outing in 2023. Mainly, that\u2019s due to the challenging circumstances surrounding the Chinese economy. And if a CNN report proves correct, 2024 could be an even rougher outing. Still, Tencent\u2019s expansionary ambitions reach beyond its home nation. With eyes on Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and several other international regions, Tencent could be interesting for speculators.\n\nTo be sure, with a market capitalization of around $337.5 billion, TCEHY doesn\u2019t exactly rate as one of the typical OTC stocks. However, it\u2019s a great confidence booster because it\u2019s in some ways the best of both worlds: offering tremendous upside potential while also being a technology stalwart in its home nation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $49.56 average price target. That implies an upside potential of over 40%. What\u2019s more, the high-side target hits $61.13, possibly delivering growth of over 73%. If that wasn\u2019t enough to whet your appetite, shares trade at only 13.06X forward earnings, below the interactive media sector\u2019s median value of 21.19X.\n\nBYD (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoving on to another Chinese company, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) presents a unique proposition. First, it\u2019s a major automotive enterprise specializing in electric vehicles, yet it technically ranks among the OTC stocks. Second, Warren Buffett \u2013 who is best known for investing in reliable blue chips \u2013 owns BYD via Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B). To be fair, Buffett has been reducing his exposure but he still owns a sizable amount.\n\nDespite the seemingly contradictory tone, investors may want to consider adding BYDDF to their portfolio. Yeah, it\u2019s one of the OTC stocks and yes, the Chinese economy looks rather putrid if I\u2019m being honest. However, with EVs becoming increasingly commoditized, guess who\u2019s going to win that battle? There\u2019s just no way that western nations can compete with their higher labor costs.\n\nAlso, investors should consider another element: demand. European politicians may want to reduce the flood of Chinese EVs. But their constituents? They love \u2018em. So do analysts, who rate BYDDF a consensus strong buy with a $36.03 price target. That implies 63% upside potential.\n\nXiaomi (XIACF) Power supply connect to electric vehicle for charge to the battery. Charging technology industry transport which are the futuristic of the Automobile. EV fuel Plug in hybrid car.\n\nSource: buffaloboy / Shutterstock.com\n\nYet one more Chinese company to discuss and then we\u2019ll get into the really wild OTC stocks. A designer and manufacturer of consumer electronics and related software, Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACF) is a cynical play. For example, beyond its consumer electronics business, it\u2019s also involved in the EV space. Recently, the company launched its first electric-powered vehicle, which might have caught the eyes of some lawyers.\n\nI\u2019m joking there, but seriously, the Xiaomi SU7 looks like it ripped off the design of a particular German brand. But if the consumers who love BYD offer any clues, the SU7 should be a hit. Apparently, it has the performance (up to 664 horsepower) and the longevity to better the top players in the ecosystem. And even if you didn\u2019t like the EV pivot, Xiaomi should win in consumer electronics.\n\nFrankly, with smart devices becoming so commoditized, people may start looking to price more often than brand. If so, XIACF has a clear pathway to robust shareholder profits. Analysts agree, rating the stock a unanimous strong buy with a $2.66 average price target.\n\nQuisitive Technology Solutions (QUISF)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOkay, let\u2019s buckle up for some serious OTC stocks and by that, I mean high risk, high reward. First, Quisitive Technology Solutions (OTCMKTS:QUISF) bills itself as a premier global Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) partner that harnesses its cloud platforms and complete technologies to generate transformational impact for midsize and enterprise-level customers. It\u2019s an intriguing idea because, at one point, shares closed at $1.54 on a weekly average basis.\n\nCurrently, QUISF trades hands at only 22 cents. And you should note that over the past 52 weeks, it lost more than 53% of its equity value. Further, according to the security\u2019s point-and-figure (P&F) chart, it prints a double bottom breakdown. According to StockCharts.com\u2019s educational section, this pattern is a bearish signal. That said, the pattern should also be viewed in a broader context due to possible whipsaw effects.\n\nAnd what is that context? Basically, the broader cloud computing market could be worth $2.43 trillion by 2030. Quisitive just needs to take a bite out of this market to potentially drive higher. Analysts seem to be on the same page, pegging the average price target at 49 cents.\n\nPeninsula Energy (PENMF) periodic table concept with black cubes. uranium element is glowing. Uranium stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a fan of the uranium energy space, I perked up when I came across this opportunity hidden among OTC stocks. As a uranium extraction specialist, Peninsula Energy (OTCMKTS:PENMF) addresses a critical supply shortage that recently sprouted. According to The Wall Street Journal, last month, uranium prices jumped to a 16-year high after one of the world\u2019s largest producers \u2013 Kazakhstan\u2019s state-owned company Kazatomprom \u2013 warned of production target shortfalls.\n\nWith uranium supplies uncertain for the next two years, several uranium players have skyrocketed. One of the exceptions is PENMF. In the trailing one-year period, the security declined by 8%. That said, it is up 15% on a year-to-date basis but that\u2019s a modest performance compared to exchange-listed uranium specialists.\n\nStill, as far as OTC stocks are concerned, Peninsula could be intriguing because of geopolitical considerations. Basically, it features 100% ownership of the Lance Project, which is one of the largest uranium projects in the U.S.\n\nBetter yet, analysts expect great things, pegging shares a moderate buy with a 17-cent target. That implies almost 85% upside potential, with the high-side target landing at 22 cents.\n\nSaturn Oil & Gas (OILSF) Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buy\n\nSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Saturn Oil & Gas (OTCMKTS:OILSF) is a resource company engaged in the business of acquisition, exploration and development of petroleum and natural gas resource despoits in Western Canada. Further, the company\u2019s current focus is to advance the exploration and development of its oil and gas properties in Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\nAs an upstream player in the hydrocarbon space, Saturn might not seem particularly relevant. Late last year, many oil-producing nations agreed to cut production in a bid to bolster prices. However, that effort did not succeed. Also, Reuters recently reported that rising U.S. oil production has frustrated the aforementioned oil producers. So, it seems OILSF could be one of the losing OTC stocks.\n\nHowever, the blowout January jobs report suggests that we shouldn\u2019t quite give up on black gold just yet. More people with jobs should translate to more resource consumption. And to be blunt, renewable energy just won\u2019t be enough to feed the growing demand profile. Notably, Echelon Wealth Partners believes OILSF could hit $4.22 per share or 137% up.\n\nVivos (RDGL) Doctor or physician calculating a patients medical bills at a desk. Medical bills, health costs, health expenses.\n\nSource: THICHA SATAPITANON / Shutterstock\n\nBefore discussing radiation oncology medical device firm Vivos (OTCMKTS:RDGL), it\u2019s important to disclose that I own RDGL stock. Please make a decision based on your own due diligence and a sober reflection of your risk tolerance. This is a security that has already lost almost 28% YTD and is likely subject to severe market turbulence.\n\nWith the caveats out of the way, Vivos is engaged in the development of its yttrium-90-based brachytherapy device, RadioGel, for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, brachytherapy is a radiation treatment that is given directly into the patient\u2019s body. Typically, the radiation is deployed using tiny devices such as wires, seeds, or rods filled with radioactive materials.\n\nWhere Vivos distinguishes itself is that RadioGel utilizes an injectable particle-gel, which delivers a very high local radiation dose. More broadly, RDGL entices speculators because the underlying industry is still in its early innings, worth $907.76 million in 2022.\n\nAs for a price target, it\u2019s difficult to say as no analyst currently covers RDGL. However, based on my personal research, I believe around 5 cents is the bottom.\n\nPenny Stocks\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That\u2019s because these \u201cpenny stocks\u201d are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u2019s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More:\u00a0Penny Stocks \u2014 How to Profit Without Getting Scammed\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a LONG position in\u00a0RDGL.

        "content": "Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings has acquired a controlling stake in an established local video game studio, a move that fits with the company's revenue diversification strategy.\n\nBy assuming control of Beijing-based Wangyuan Shengtang, a 15-year-old video game developer and publisher known for its Swords of Legends series, Tencent will gain access to the premium franchise and diversify its revenue stream, said Zhang Shule, game sector analyst with consultancy CBJ Think Tank.\n\nTencent, through an investment vehicle Guangxi Tencent Venture Capital, last Friday acquired 100 per cent of Dongtai Yunpeng Culture Co, which owns 43 per cent of Wangyuan, according to business registry service Qichacha. Separately, the investment vehicle also increased its stake in Wangyuan from 23 per cent to 31 per cent.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nTogether with the 20 per cent stake Tencent holds through Linzhi Tencent Technology Co, which first backed the gaming studio in late 2020, the Shenzhen-based video game powerhouse now owns more than 94 per cent of Wangyuan.\n\nAs the controlling stakeholder in the Beijing-based studio, Zhang said Tencent will gain intellectual property, development strength, as well as marketing and distribution channels that will \"enrich Tencent's gaming empire\".\n\nMeng Xianming, 58, who founded Wangyuan in 2009, will retain his chief executive role under Tencent, which has promised to give free rein to the core games development teams at the company, according to a person close to Wangyuan, who requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nTencent increased its stake in Wangyuan because it is one of China's best single-player game developers, with strengths in aesthetics, taste, and game storytelling, the person said. Its business model - selling games upfront - is different to Tencent's focus on online and mobile games, which are downloaded for free but monetised by in-game purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nUp until July 2021, Wangyuan had sold 6 million copies of the Swords of Legends franchise.\n\nTencent and Wangyuan did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.\n\nThe Swords of Legends franchise, which blends Chinese mythology with martial arts elements, is one of the most well-known role-playing games in the country.\n\nSeparately, Tencent and Wangyuan have a partnership in Ash Echoes, a new title developed by a Wangyuan unit and co-published by both firms for domestic and overseas markets.\n\nTencent co-founder, chairman and chief executive Pony Ma Huateng recently told an annual staff gathering that the strategy of the firm's video gaming operation was to continue expanding overseas, which he described as the \"best shot to build the company into an international business\".\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "The eSports gaming stocks have captured the attention of investors, positioning themselves as a significant investment arena. Once considered a niche pastime, eSports has evolved into a global phenomenon with remarkable staying power.\n\nNotably, as per Statista\u2019s projections, the global eSports market is set to reach a revenue of $4.3 billion in 2024. Further, the expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.10% from 2024 to 2028. Additionally, Statista anticipates a substantial increase in user penetration, rising from 11.7% in 2024 to 13.7% by 2028. Clearly, this reflects the growing global interest in eSports.\n\nMoreover, eSports has gained such popularity that Saudi Arabia recently launched the annual eSports World Cup, featuring top games and substantial prize money. As traditional sports grapple with the challenges posed by a global pandemic, online eSports tournaments and streaming services have seized this opportunity. They thrive amidst shifting consumer behavior.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConsequently, these three stocks represent an enticing prospect to capitalize on the rise of competitive gaming.\n\nTake-Two Interactive (TTWO) Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) logo displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nTake-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) stands out as a stellar performer in the gaming and eSports arena this year. The company excels in the gaming and esports space, leveraging its NBA 2K franchise as a pivotal element of its successful esports strategy. Notably, the successful launch of the 2018 NBA 2K League marked its inaugural venture into this realm. It demonstrated Take-Two Interactive\u2019s continued commitment to the growing eSports sector.\n\nMoreover, TTWO\u2019s recent financial results left the market astonished. Earnings per share skyrocketed to $1.42, surpassing forecasts by 38%. Additionally, the company achieved record-breaking revenue of $1.44 billion, surpassing preliminary estimates and underscoring its robust growth trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nTake-Two Interactive\u2019s historic inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index signifies a groundbreaking milestone. It reflects high investor optimism and heightened anticipation for future releases, especially the hotly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI. Concurrently, the release of the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer underscores the company\u2019s market prowess.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has boldly invested a whopping $15 billion in the eSports industry, sending shockwaves through the regional market. TCEHY actively fosters talent, promotes league formation, and creates esports-themed parks within its mainstream gaming strategy, firmly anchoring its commitment.\n\nTo globalize eSports and align it with the stature of the Olympics, Tencent Holdings has forged a strategic partnership with the Global eSports Federation. This collaborative effort not only extends Tencent Holding\u2019s reach on a global scale but also underscores its dedication to elevating eSports to an international level. The company\u2019s participation in events like the League of Legends championship further reinforces its significance in eSports, captivating a vast global audience.\n\nThe company\u2019s eSports strides make headlines, but its expansion into e-commerce, cloud services, and digital content complements its dominant gaming division. This strategic diversification, fueled by robust tech and a massive user base, cements Tencent Holding\u2019s competitive advantage in the technology landscape.\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) A mobile gamer cheering on her smartphone with neon background. MGAM stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nElectronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has admirably outperformed in the esports stocks arena, boasting a remarkable year-over-year (YOY) return of around 17%. The fiscal 2024 third quarter report significantly exceeded expectations, with earnings per share of $1.07. That surpassed consensus estimates by a notable 17 cents and marking a remarkable 47% surge from the previous year\u2019s 73 cents.\n\nMoreover, EA\u2019s triumph stems from its active engagement with the eSports community. Investments in events such as the EA Sports WRC Knockout Trophy \u201923 and the Apex Legends Global Series Year 2 Championship have expanded their reach and visibility among eSports enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of UEFA Euro 2024 into EA sports FC 24 and related digital platforms reinforces EA\u2019s preeminent position.

        "content": "In a surprise move, China's gaming regulator approved a new batch of foreign video games on Friday, including hit title Dungeon & Fighter (DnF) Mobile to be operated in China by Tencent Holdings, as Beijing seeks to reassure the stock market after scrapping a controversial gaming regulation.\n\nThe National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), the agency in charge of licensing video games in China, published a list of 32 newly approved imported games on Thursday, including titles run by major technology firms including Tencent, NetEase and ByteDance.\n\nTencent's stock price in Hong Kong gained 2.9 per cent on Friday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nTencent, the Chinese partner of DnF Mobile developer Nexon, a Japanese-Korean game studio, first planned to launch the title in China in 2020, but was thwarted by Beijing's tightened controls over game licensing and content at the time.\n\nNPPA's approvals were a \"positive surprise\" as DnF Mobile from Tencent is \"highly anticipated by the market\", Jefferies analysts wrote in a research note on Friday.\n\nTwo video games for the Nintendo Switch, Kirby Star Allies and Taiko no Tatsujin, also published by Tencent in China, were among the other titles in the newly approved batch.\n\nMobile games Bleach: Soul Resonance, operated in China by ByteDance-owned game studio Nuverse, and Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, published by gaming giant NetEase in China, were also approved for release.\n\nUnder Beijing's strict censorship system for the country's gaming market, the world's largest-foreign game titles must apply for a licence through a Chinese partner before they can legally generate income in the country.\n\nThe latest approvals come as Chinese authorities try to shore up confidence in the industry, which recently suffered a blow from draft regulation that sought to curb \"excessive\" playing and spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe proposed draft rules triggered a market rout that wiped out tens of billions of dollars of market value from Chinese video gaming firms, prompting concerns of an extended gaming industry crackdown in China.\n\nAuthorities then took steps to contain the damage, initially attempting to justify the proposal as an effort to promote the \"healthy development\" of the gaming sector. But Beijing later removed a key official involved in overseeing the country's gaming market. And in a rare move, NPPA last month retracted its proposed rules, removing the notice of the draft regulation from its website.\n\nLast week, NPPA gave the green light to 115 new domestic video games, the largest batch in 18 months. In December, it approved 105 titles, the first time the number exceeded 100 games in one batch since July 2022.\n\nChina's video game sales increased 14 per cent in 2023 to 303 billion yuan (US$42.7 billion), marking the highest annual total since the data became available in 2003, according to a report published in December by the Game Publishing Committee of the China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association.\n\nChinese video gaming firms' international expansion, however, slowed last year, with overseas sales of China-developed titles down 5.7 per cent year on year to US$163.7 billion.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Tencent axes Square Enix 'Nier' mobile game as it hunts for a new hit -sources",
        "content": "By Josh Ye\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent halted the development of a highly anticipated mobile game based on Square Enix's \"Nier\" franchise in December, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, marking a setback in the Chinese gaming giant's hunt for new hits.\n\nShenzhen-based Tencent cancelled the project that had been in the works for nearly two years in part because it struggled to find a compelling monetisation model given the expensive development costs and franchise rights, according to the people, who were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nTencent and Tokyo-based Square Enix, also the developer of the popular \"Final Fantasy\" franchise, declined to comment.\n\nSquare Enix said last year that \"Nier: Automata\", the latest game in the \"Nier\" franchise where one plays as a humanoid robot battling alien machines, had sold over 7.5 million copies since its 2017 release for computers and consoles.\n\nThe mobile game's cancellation shows cracks in Tencent's decade-long strategy of turning hits on consoles and personal computers into mobile games.\n\nThe world's biggest gaming company had gone on a spending spree signing licensing deals with popular franchises, where in many cases it was willing to pay owners an extra premium in order to outbid rivals like NetEase.\n\nChairman Pony Ma said on Monday that Tencent's gaming business, which accounts for more than 30% of revenue, was under threat because some of its recent games had fallen short of expectations.\n\nThe \"Nier\" mobile game's development had made significant progress before it was axed, including a playable internal demo that showcased its robust designs in both story and combat, one of the people said.\n\nThe cancellation of \"Nier\" has not led to any job losses because employees are allowed to transfer to other Tencent units, the people said.\n\nHIGH ROYALTY FEES\n\nMobile games adapted from famous computer and console games, known as intellectual property (IP) games, often entail hefty fees to IP owners, in this case to Square Enix.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoyalty fees of 15% to 20% of sales are typical, the people said, while Apple's App Store takes a 30% cut and marketing and user acquisition can cost another 30% to 40%, leaving slim profit margins.\n\nAs growth in mobile games slows and development costs rise, Tencent is finding that many IP games are becoming too expensive to pursue, the people said.\n\nOne of the people said that Tencent was only willing to pay royalty fees below 10% in recent negotiations with IP holders.\n\nIn previous years, Tencent had successfully adapted famous games such as South Korean developer Krafton's \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\", also called PUBG, for mobile devices. PUBG Mobile, released in 2018, has been one of Tencent's most profitable games ever.\n\nBut Tencent has struggled to find a new global hit from an IP game since \"League of Legends: Wild Rift\" in 2020. That game's IP was owned by Tencent subsidiary Riot Games.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors such as miHoYo and NetEase have found massive success with hits based on their own IP games such as \"Genshin Impact\" and \"Eggy Party\", putting further pressure on Tencent.\n\nThe Chinese company is hoping to revive its fortunes with a slate of other IP games for smartphones waiting to be launched this year or in 2025, including \"Delta Force\", \"Need for Speed\" and \"Assassin's Creed\".\n\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Brenda Goh and Jamie Freed)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Nexon Co. surged after Chinese regulators approved their Mobile DnF game, green-lighting a long-anticipated marquee title that had failed to pass regulatory muster for years.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier A $560 Billion Property Warning Hits Banks From NY to Tokyo Apple\u2019s China Slump Deepens Even as Total Sales Grow Again QQQ Up in Late Trading as Meta Soars, Apple Falls: Markets Wrap Meta Plans $50 Billion Buyback in Bid to Win Over Investors\n\nInvestors welcomed the approval at a time the world\u2019s largest mobile gaming arena is grappling with a downturn and regulatory uncertainty. Tencent, which developed the title jointly with its Korean partner, gained as much as 5.9% Friday in Hong Kong, its most since July. Nexon traded limit-up in Tokyo, set for a record daily of more than 20%.\n\nThe title\u2019s approval is a big boost for Tencent\u2019s 2024 pipeline, which still relies in part on years-old titles and is hungry for new blockbusters. The Chinese company had counted on the title to bolster its pipeline as far back as 2020, but the game failed to emerge at the height of a Beijing regulatory crackdown. Nexon said at the time it was delaying the title to comply with restrictions aimed at curbing addiction and play time among Chinese minors.\n\nDnF, or Dungeon & Fighter, contributes an estimated quarter of Nexon\u2019s sales, and its launch in China will likely help power up the franchise, Bloomberg Intelligence said.\n\n\u201cWe view this as a positive surprise as this title is highly anticipated by the market,\u201d Jefferies analyst Thomas Chong wrote.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nThe approval of Nexon\u2019s Dungeon & Fighter (DNF) Mobile game for launch in China, the world\u2019s largest mobile gaming market, is set to catalyze sales. The title achieved 60 million preregistrations before its planned August 2020 launch in China, which was delayed indefinitely for regulatory reasons, vs. 2 million downloads achieved by the mobile game in South Korea since launch. DNF, Nexon\u2019s top-selling franchise, has stayed popular among Chinese PC gamers since its 2008 launch.\n\nStory continues\n\n- Nathan Naidu, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nMore broadly, the approvals \u2014 which included several Nintendo Co. Switch titles \u2014 suggest business as usual in the Chinese gaming arena, at a time concerns linger about regulatory intentions.\n\nIn December, the industry watchdog spooked investors by proposing a plethora of regulations that appeared to signal its intention to sharply enhance oversight, in particular a cap on in-game spending that it never specified nor clarified.\n\nThe watchdog has since signaled its intention to hear the industry out and possibly roll back some of the harsher edicts, though officials have made no promises. The feedback period for the draft rules ended Jan. 22 and a final version is expected soon.\n\nRead More: Tencent Recoups Some Losses After China Soothes Crackdown Fears\n\n(Updates with a chart and regulation context in the second paragraph.

Tensions were high as senators entered a back-and-forth with the chief executives, grilling them over inaction to implement safety guidelines to protect younger users.\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), authors of the Kids Online Safety Act of 2023, join Yahoo Finance to discuss the key takeaways from the hearings and the importance of passing their bill.\n\nSenator Blumenthal affirms why his legislation is needed: \"They're making money because more eyeballs, more addictive content mean more advertising and more dollars to them. I think more than ever, I feel we need the Kids Online Safety Act to make sure that these tech executives are held accountable. And I will tell you, that as much as Mark Zuckerberg may have felt good about apologizing, or seeming to apologize, actions speak louder than words. And the actions of these tech companies is essentially to ignore the harm that they're doing and fail to act responsibly.\"\n\nSenator Blackburn comments on the bipartisan sentiments held toward social media platforms: \"One of the things Senator Blumenthal and I have talked about regularly as we have worked on this specific legislation and others of us who have worked on privacy, online privacy, we have talked about how you have the army of lawyers and lobbyists that fight us on putting in place regulation. They're fighting because addiction is their business model. They have to have eyeballs locked on those screens in order to get their way, if you will, and to continue their existing business model.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino",

        "content": "A popular video game developed by a Japanese studio has set off an unexpected cloud-computing race between Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, as the two Chinese tech giants rush to draw players to their respective servers.\n\nPalworld, an open-world survival game developed by Pocketpair that lets players catch and raise creatures known as Pals to build structures and fight, has become a breakout hit since its release on game distribution platform Steam on January 19, selling more than 8 million copies in less than six days.\n\nWith Pocketpair struggling to accommodate the surge of gamers that has overwhelmed its servers, the Tokyo-based company has given players the option to host the game on private servers.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nChinese cloud service providers, including Tencent and Post owner Alibaba, have seized on the opportunity to promote their server packages to mainland gamers.\n\nPalworld, known among gamers as \"Pokemon with guns\", has become in breakout hit around the world, including in China. Photo: Handout alt=Palworld, known among gamers as \"Pokemon with guns\", has become in breakout hit around the world, including in China. Photo: Handout>\n\nAlibaba is offering dedicated server plans for groups of eight or 20 Palworld players, with monthly fees ranging from 26.5 yuan to 271.8 yuan (US$3.71 to US$38.06). Tencent has also introduced similar packages, priced between 26 yuan and 580 yuan per month.\n\n\"In view of the popularity of Palworld ... which led to problems on the official servers, setting up private servers is the most stable and comfortable solution for those who are financially well-off,\" read a post on Tencent Cloud's official WeChat account published on January 25.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba and Tencent have repeatedly engaged in price wars in China's competitive cloud computing market.\n\nAlibaba Cloud announced last April that it was cutting the prices of its core products and services in China by 15 to 50 per cent. Tencent followed suit soon after, pledging to slash the costs of some of its cloud servers by as much as 40 per cent.\n\nAlibaba and Tencent are capitalising on the popularity of Palworld, which is currently the most-played game on Steam despite its hefty price tag of US$29.99. The average price for games sold on Steam, the world's largest digital distribution platform for computer games, is US$15.50.\n\nPlayers are mostly impressed by the game's clever mash-up of elements, including the thrill of monster-catching and the cute animated designs of those creatures, according to Zhang Shule, a game analyst at CBJ Think Tank.\n\nHowever, the game - known among players as \"Pokemon with guns\" - has also run into controversy. The Pokemon Company said last week that it planned to investigate claims that Palworld infringed on the intellectual property rights of its iconic franchise.\n\n\"We have received libellous comments about our artists and some tweets that seem close to death threats,\" Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe wrote last week on X, known formerly as Twitter.\n\nWhile Steam's global platform is inaccessible in mainland China, Palworld has caught on in the country, where players are known to buy and play games on Steam through virtual private networks.\n\nPalworld is also available on Microsoft's Xbox.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "ByteDance\u2019s CEO is mad at his employees for missing the AI wave. He\u2019s the latest Chinese tech executive to fret about being too slow to adapt",
        "content": "China's tech royalty is going through a bit of a shake-up. Upstarts like PDD Holdings, owner of Pinduoduo and Temu, and returning giants like Baidu, are taking advantage of changing e-commerce trends and the rise of AI to challenge firms like Alibaba, Tencent and JD. Even ByteDance, which revolutionized social media with its short-video apps Douyin and TikTok, is feeling the heat.\n\nByteDance CEO Liang Rubo was just the latest to fret about being left behind according to excerpts from his speech posted on the company's WeChat account. Liang complained that employees were \"not sensitive enough to external changes\" and griped that staff only started talking about ChatGPT, the buzzy chatbot developed by OpenAI that sparked the AI boom, in 2023.\n\nLiang warned that inefficiencies and a lack of speed would make ByteDance a \"mediocre organization.\" He cited one instance where a task was initially forecast to take 1,000 man-days to complete, a timeframe that was reduced to just 15 man-days after an in-depth review.\n\nMuch like in the U.S., China's tech sector is in the midst of its own race to adopt generative AI. The most prominent effort is from Baidu and its ERNIE chatbot, which the tech firm claims is as good as OpenAI's GPT-4 model. But Alibaba, Tencent, JD, and an array of Chinese startups are all launching their own AI services.\n\nByteDance launched its own chatbot, Doubao, in August last year. The Vergereported in mid-December that ByteDance was using OpenAI's technology to train its own chatbot, violating OpenAI's terms of service. OpenAI has since suspended ByteDance's account.\n\nLiang is the second Chinese tech CEO to complain about employees this week.\n\nOn Monday, Tencent CEO and co-founder Pony Ma told staff that the company's video game business \"achieved nothing\" last year. He complained that Tencent's new games did not perform as well as expected, reports Reuters. While Tencent's staple hits like Honor of Kings and PUBG Mobile continue to deliver strong revenue, the company's newer games are losing to those from other Chinese developers like NetEase and miHoYo, developer of Genshin Impact.\n\nStory continues\n\nTencent's CEO now wants to juice more growth from WeChat, the company's ubiquitous messaging app. Ma told employees that they should \"find new sprouts from the old tree,\" referring to the now 13-year-old platform and its social media offerings.\n\nYet Ma was hesitant about expanding WeChat's other major offering. The platform also serves as one of China's two major digital payment processors, alongside Ant Group's Alipay. Ma reportedly told staff from the company's digital payments service unit to reduce its share in the market, and that the company should be viewed as \"a partner of banks.\"\n\nRegulators fined Tencent almost 3 billion yuan, or $422 million, last year for violating regulations regarding managing customer data.\n\nAlibaba and JD\n\nChina's e-commerce giants are also criticizing their employees for taking it easy.\n\nRicard Liu, chairman and founder of JD.com, told employees not to \"lie flat,\" referring to the Chinese slang term of doing the bare minimum to get by, in a post on the company's internal discussion board. Liu warned that, without change, there would be \"no way out for the company.\"\n\nLiu's warning followed a similar message from Jack Ma, founder of fellow e-commerce firm Alibaba. Ma took to Alibaba's internal forum in November calling for \"change and reform\" to the company, and praising newcomer PDD Holdings.\n\nPDD Holdings is the owner of the e-commerce platform Pinduoduo and the U.S.-based shopping platform Temu. In China, Pinduoduo tends to offer lower prices and also introduced group buying which allows consumers in community groups to buy items like groceries in bulk for a lower price.\n\nWhile Alibaba and JD.com generate more revenue than PDD, investors seem more bullish about PDD\u2019s prospects. PDD reported 94% year-on-year revenue growth for the quarter ending Sept. 30, and shares of PDD are up more than 20% in the past year contrasted with a drop in over 30% for Alibaba and over 60% for JD.com.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",
