        "title": "Chipotle CEO says \u2018generous portions\u2019 will become standard after people blasted its skimpy serving sizes on social media",
        "content": "Chipotle\u2019s CEO said the chain is making \u201cgenerous portions\u201d the standard after a wave of social-media criticism targeted its supposedly small portion sizes.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO Brian Niccol said during Wednesday\u2019s second-quarter earnings call that about 10% of Chipotle\u2019s 3,500 restaurants are outliers in terms of portion sizes, according to customer surveys, and the chain is on a mission to make bigger portions uniform across all locations.\n\nChipotle execs have previously denied that anything had changed with its portions, and Chipotle founder and former CEO Steve Ells said last month the restaurant is \u201cquite generous\u201d with its portions. Still, the backlash has now spurred the chain to make changes.\n\n\u201cThere was never a directive to provide less to our customers,\u201d Niccol said Wednesday.\n\nTo fix the uneven portions, Chipotle is taking a closer look at the outlier restaurants and doubling down on training and coaching in part to reemphasize larger portion sizes, Niccol said. That means every customer should get two substantial scoops of rice and four ounces of meat, Chipotle chief financial officer Jack Hartung told Bloomberg.\n\nBut the new focus on portions will also come at a cost for the chain, Hartung said. Meeting the new standard could cost the company $50 million, he added. But for Niccol, the efforts are well worth it.\n\n\u201cGenerous portion is a core brand equity of Chipotle. It always has been, and it always will be,\u201d Niccol said on Wednesday\u2019s earnings call.\n\nChipotle\u2019s portion plan comes after a Wells Fargo analyst last month revealed a large disparity in the weights of burrito bowls in New York City. To \u201cput the \u2018weight debate\u2019 to rest,\u201d the analyst, Zachary Fadem, ordered 75 burrito bowls at eight different locations and found the heaviest bowl weighed 47% more than the lightest for in-person orders. For online orders, the heaviest bowl was 87% heavier than the lightest, according to Fadem\u2019s report. Fadem also found that many of the 10 lightest burrito bowls came from the same location. Chart shows the difference in weight of burrito bowls ordered at Chipotle.\n\nChipotle has been lambasted on social media for supposedly skimping on ingredients, with some users saying the restaurant would give bigger portions to people recording while their order is prepared. Chipotle later denied the rumor, but not before droves of users tried it, much to the displeasure of workers.\n\nAlthough Niccol had previously denied that Chipotle\u2019s portions had gotten smaller, he told Fortune that giving employees a pleading look could get customers extra ingredients.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Chipotle's California customers are spending less after the chain upped prices due to wage hike: CFO",
        "content": "Californian burrito lovers are fed up with higher prices.\n\nWhile some thought Chipotle would be able to pass along higher costs to its loyal following once the FAST Act took effect in April, CFO Jack Hartung said customers across the industry pulled back.\n\n\"It's not because the Chipotle burrito costs a little more. There's really a reduced spending across the restaurant industry [in California],\" Hartung told Yahoo Finance, \"When we've looked at it, restaurant companies that took a very high increase had a impact on sales, about the same as what we've seen. Restaurants that have taken no increase had the same kind-of reduction in sales.\"\n\nThe FAST act mandated food chains that have at least 60 locations nationwide to raise their minimum wage for restaurant employees to $20 per hour, up from $16. As a response, Chipotle raised prices in California by 6.5% to 7% in April, Hartung said.\n\nThe \"best offense\" to combat the slowing growth in foot traffic is with \"great operations,\" Hartung said.\n\n\"It's high quality food, it's big portions, it's a fast experience, and it's the food that they crave,\" Hartung said of Chipotle's recipe to success, regardless of the macro environment. SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 01: Workers fill food orders at a Chipotle restaurant on April 01, 2024 in San Rafael, California. A new minimum wage law went into effect in California today that calls for fast food restaurants with at least 60 locations nationwide to pay employees a minimum of $20 per hour at their stores in California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nIn its latest quarter, the company beat Wall Street estimates for revenue, earnings, and same store sales.\n\nFor Q3, the company expects labor cost \"to be in the low 25% range due to seasonally lower sales with wage inflation to remain at about 6%,\" Hartung told investors on the earnings call. California accounts for around 15% of Chipotle locations.\n\n\"About half of the wage inflation is due to the nearly 20% step-up in wages in California as a result of the increase in minimum wage for restaurant companies like ours that took effect in April,\" he added.\n\nFoot traffic jumped 8% in the quarter, more than the 6.3% expected, with growth across all income cohorts. That's compared to a 0.6% decline in the industry, according to a note to clients from Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo.\n\n\"Market share gains despite burger wars reinforce our view of Chipotle\u2019s enduring value superiority,\" Gargiulo wrote. \"Wth the normalization of trends and on the back of the pricing resistance encountered in California,\" Gargiulo expects fiscal year 2024 to end with 7.8% sales growth.\n\nGargiulo said the company will still be able to increase prices, if the fall return of another limited-time offering \u2014 smoked brisket \u2014 surpasses expectations, and the inflationary environment persists.\n\nStory continues\n\nHartung said this limited-time offering will likely bring in more customers, but is more expensive for the company than its current Chicken Al Pastor special.\n\nThe industry at large has been keeping tabs on the impact California's higher wages.\n\n\"We continue to see visitation trends for most QSR and fast-casual restaurant chains in California lag the national average since the implementation of the $20 minimum wage increase in the state (and subsequent menu price increases by many operators),\" R.J. Hottovy, Placer.ai's head of analytical research, told Yahoo Finance in an email.\n\nChipotle's year over year weekly foot traffic growth in California lags behind the company's national average by more than 5% since April 1, according to Placer.ai.\n\nDomino's Pizza CEO Russell Weiner told Yahoo Finance, \"We haven't had closures [in California], we haven't had to lay off our drivers, like some of our competition has, but it's a long haul, and in the short term, you're definitely going to lose orders when you increase prices.\"\n\nThe pizza chain's Q2 results \"benefitted from 1.5%\" of price increases, \"which was inclusive of high single digits [increase] in California,\" CFO Sandeep Reddy said on the earnings call.\n\nMcDonald's is set to report its Q2 earnings on Monday, July 29, but Yahoo Finance previously reported one McDonald's franchise owner that made the decision to close one location.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 25, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla TSLA, CrowdStrike CRWD, Chipotle CMG, Ford F and ServiceNow NOW.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nBig Hump Day Selloff Before Chipotle Beats, Ford Misses\n\nWhat looked like a simple continuation of a market sell-off this morning got worse. I mean, it clearly did. Only the small-cap Russell 2000 spent any time in green at all today \u2014 and that was a mere minute or two early in the session. The Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all closed near session lows. The Dow dropped -504 points, -1.25% \u2014 and it got off easy. The S&P 500 fell -2.31%, the Russell was down -2.13% and the Nasdaq really hit the skids today, -654 points or -3.64%.\n\nWe noted earlier some disappointment from Tesla and other big names reporting yesterday after the bell may have put a damper on today's trading, but there's also the sudden rollback of the so-called \"Trump Trade\" from last week, now that President Joe Biden has retired from his campaign to win a second term. Further, the CrowdStrike glitch from last Friday reportedly cost $5 billion in direct losses and continues to hamper a wide array of companies.\n\nAlso, New Home Sales for June reached their lowest point in seven months. The +617K headline was well off the +640K expected and even the slightly upwardly revised +621K in May. In the four regions, the Northeast was hit hardest, -7.7% year over year, whereas only the South eked out a gain, +0.3%. Supply came in at 9.3 months, with a median sale price of $417,300. These numbers compare to the 3.89 million Existing Home Sales reported yesterday, which was down from 4.11 million the previous month. The slump continues, and is likely to until the Fed cuts interest rates and frees up some cheaper mortgages.\n\nS&P flash PMI for July Services and Manufacturing also came out earlier. Services pulled slightly ahead of expectations to 56.0, and ahead of the 55.3 posted a month ago, while Manufacturing went sub-50 for the first time since December of last year to 49.5 \u2014 two points lower than expected and below the prior month's 51.6. Compare these numbers with the multi-year high in July of three years ago: 63.4. (The 50 mark is the level between gain and loss.)\n\nChipotlebeat earnings estimates for the sixth-straight quarter. Earnings of 33 cents per share outpaced the Zacks consensus by two cents, with revenues of $3.0 billion surpassing the $2.94 billion expected, +18% year over year. Full-year comps grew +11.1% on +17% foot traffic year-over-year. This is the first report since Chipotle did a 50-1 stock split in mid-June. Shares had jumped +10% initially after the report, but have since come back down to earth.\n\nStory continues\n\nFordshares missed bottom-line estimates badly. Earnings of 47 cents per share were well below the 64 cents projected, though revenues swung to a positive +6% year over year to $47.8 billion from $41.50 billion expected. Its Blue hybrid gained +34%, and is now 9% of its global vehicle mix. But the sixth earnings miss in the last 12 quarters have sent shares down -12% in late trading, nearly wiping out the automotive giant's gains year to date.\n\nServiceNow, on the other hand, posted another strong quarter. Earnings of $3.13 per share swept past estimates of $2.85 and the $2.37 per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $2.63 billion amounted to a +2.2% beat, on subscriber growth of +23% year over year. Shares are up more than +6% on this report, basically doubling year-to-date gains for the Silicon Valley-based cloud cybersecurity firm.\n\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "Chipotle (CMG) Q2 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat Estimates, Stock Up",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG released second-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. Following the earnings release, the company\u2019s shares rose 4.3% during the after-hours trading session on Jul 24.\r\n\r\nDuring the second quarter, the company benefited from successful promotions regarding Chicken Al Pastor driving significant engagement and sales. Also, the emphasis on throughput and staff training proved effective in meeting heightened demand and supported transaction growth in the quarter.\r\n\r\nChipotle completed a 50-to-1 stock split on Jun 26, one of the largest in New York Stock Exchange history. This split aims to make shares more accessible to employees and a wider range of investors, allowing them to purchase shares at more affordable prices.\r\n\r\nThe company's financial position remains strong, ending the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments and no debt. During the second quarter, CMG repurchased $151.4 million worth of stock at an average price of $63.52. As of Jun 30, the company had approximately $647.7 million available under the buyback program.\n\nQ2 Earnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Quote\n\nIn the quarter under review, CMG reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 34 cents, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. The bottom line increased 36% from 25 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nQuarterly revenues of $2.97 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $2.94 billion by 1.3%. The top line rose 18.2% on a year-over-year basis. The upside was driven by strong comparable restaurant sales growth backed by increased transactions (8.7%) and average checks (2.4%).\r\n\r\nComparable restaurant sales during the second quarter rose 11.1% year over year compared with 7% growth reported in the previous quarter. Our estimate was pegged at 8.6%. Digital sales contributed 35.3% to total food and beverage revenues.\r\n\r\nStrength in new restaurant openings aided the company\u2019s performance in the second quarter. In the reported quarter, Chipotle opened 52 new restaurants with 46 locations, including a Chipotlane. It also opened an international licensed restaurant. The company reported solid performances of the new restaurant, thereby uplifting sales, margins and returns.\n\nCosts, Operating Highlights & Net Income\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, food, beverage and packaging costs, as a percentage of revenues, came in at 29.4%, flat year over year. During the quarter, the company stated that benefits from menu price increases (implemented last year) were partly negated by rising avocado costs, increased oil usage and high demand for beef (resulting from the Braised Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative). We suggested the metric to be 29.5%.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter under discussion, the restaurant-level operating margin reached 28.9%, up from 27.5% reported in the prior-year period. The benefit of sales leverage drove the uptick. However, this was partially mitigated by wage and ingredient inflation. We predicted the metric to be 28.1%.\r\n\r\nAdjusted net income in the reported quarter amounted to $462.9 million, up 31.9% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $426.9 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAs of Jun 30, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $806.5 million compared with $560.6 million as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nAs of Jun 30, 2024, inventory totaled $35.6 million compared with $39.3 million as of Dec 31, 2023. Goodwill (as a percentage of total assets) reached 0.2% at the end of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, management expects comps growth in the mid to high-single-digit range.\r\n\r\nCMG anticipates to open 285-315 new restaurants in 2024. It suggests a 2024 tax rate in the range of 25-27%.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nChipotle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail \u2013 Restaurants industry include:\r\n\r\nEl Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. LOCO sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). LOCO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 19.4%, on average. The stock has moved up 11% in the past year.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures slipped lower Thursday, with sentiment hit hard by weak earnings from a couple of tech majors.\n\nHere are some of the biggest premarket U.S. stock movers today:\n\nFord (NYSE:F) stock slumped 13% after the auto giant reported a significant profit miss for the second quarter as it continues to battle costly quality issues and an EV business that is weighing on its bottom line.\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) stock rose 3.6% after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, with the fast casual Mexican restaurant chain logging strong comparable restaurant sales in the quarter.\n\nIBM  (NYSE:IBM) stock rose 3.1% after increased interest in artificial intelligence helped the tech consulting firm log stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.\n\nHasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) stock soared 11% after the toymaker posted a smaller-than-expected drop in second-quarter as steady digital gaming demand offset a slump in toy sales, while cost-control strategies helped it beat profit expectations.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock fell 5.8% after the carrier reported a 46% drop in profit and forecast a potential drop in unit revenue for the third quarter as an oversupplied U.S. market has forced airlines to discount tickets during what is usually the most lucrative period of the year.\n\nAmerican Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock fell 7.3% after the carrier cut its annual profit forecast as uneven demand trends and overcapacity in certain markets dampened its pricing power.\n\nRoyal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) stock fell 1.5% despite the cruise operator raising its annual profit forecast for the third time this year on the back of continued demand for cruise vacations and higher ticket pricing.\n\nHarley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) stock rose 1% after the manufacturer of iconic motorcycles reported a 23% rise in quarterly profit, as demand held up for its pricier bikes during the summer riding season.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) stock rose 2.6% after the beverage company\u2019s quarterly earnings and revenue met expectations as higher prices fueled its U.S. soda sales.\n\nUnilever  (LON:ULVR) ADRs rose 6.5% after the consumer goods giant raised its full-year margin guidance and said the spinoff of its Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream business was on track to complete by the end of 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFord, Southwest, America Airlines fall premarket; Hasbro, Chipotle rise\n\nRoyal Caribbean raises annual profit forecast as cruise demand thrives\n\nAstraZeneca shares fall despite guidance raise as drugmaker warns on income\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) said on Wednesday that the fast food chain will commit to keeping portion sizes uniform across all its restaurants, addressing a slew of social media accusations that the firm was shrinking its portions.\n\nThe firm denied that there was ever a directive to provide smaller portions to customers, and said that management had identified about 10% to 15% of its restaurants which were receiving a disproportionate amount of criticism over portion sizes.\n\nThe company will be \u201cdoubling down\u201d on training those restaurants, Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said in a post-earnings call.\n\nHartung\u2019s comments came after Chipotle clocked a stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit and also saw strong growth in comparable restaurant sales.\n\nBut Hartuan also noted that the firm will take a hit from efforts to standardize its portion sizes, and that it was expected to see some margin pressure in the coming quarters.\n\nStill, CEO Brian Niccols noted that the Mexican fast food chain was already seeing improvements in customer feedback.\n\n\u201cWe have also leaned in and reemphasize generous portions across all of our restaurants as it is a core brand equity,\u201d Niccols said in the post-earnings call.\n\nAnalysts at TD welcomed the management\u2019s comments on portion sizes, and that the issue could be resolved in time for Chipotle to meet 7% comparable sales growth for the year.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased management grabbed the bull by the horns and addressed negative\n\npublicity surrounding portion sizing that has been weighing on the investor narrative,\u201d TD analysts wrote in a note.\n\nStill, TD cut Chipotle\u2019s price target to $65.0 from $72.0, while lowering its 2024 EPS outlook by 2 cents.\n\nChipotle had sparked controversy on social media earlier this year after several posters accused the firm of intentionally serving smaller portions.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Beats Q2 Earnings and Revenue Estimates",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.31 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.25 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.68%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this Mexican food chain would post earnings of $0.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.27, delivering a surprise of 17.39%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nChipotle , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, posted revenues of $2.97 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.27%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.51 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nChipotle shares have added about 14.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 16.5%.\n\nWhat's Next for Chipotle?\n\nWhile Chipotle has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Chipotle: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.27 on $2.84 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.10 on $11.34 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Restaurants is currently in the bottom 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Bloomin' Brands (BLMN), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 6.\n\nThis owner of Outback Steakhouse and other casual dining spots is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -23%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nBloomin' Brands' revenues are expected to be $1.13 billion, down 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Chipotle's (NYSE:CMG) Q2 Sales Beat Estimates",
        "content": "Chipotle's (NYSE:CMG) Q2 Sales Beat Estimates\n\nMexican fast-food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) beat analysts' expectations in Q2 CY2024, with revenue up 18.2% year on year to $2.97 billion. It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.34 per share, improving from its profit of $0.25 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Chipotle? Find out in our full research report.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Q2 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $2.97 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.94 billion (1.1% beat) Operating profit: $586.1 million vs analyst estimates of $566.9 million (3.4% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.34 vs analyst estimates of $0.32 (7% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 41.8%, up from 41.4% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $422.1 million, similar to the previous quarter Same-Store Sales rose 11.1% year on year (7.4% in the same quarter last year) (beat vs. expectations of 9.1%) Market Capitalization: $72.17 billion\n\n\"The second quarter was outstanding as successful brand marketing, including the return of Chicken Al Pastor, drove strong demand to our restaurants. Our focus and training around throughput paid off as we were able to meet the stronger demand trends with terrific service and speed driving over 8% transaction growth in the quarter,\" said Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, Chipotle.\n\nBorn from a desire to offer quick meals with fresh, flavorful ingredients, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a fast-food chain known for its healthy, Mexican-inspired cuisine and customizable dishes.\n\nModern Fast Food\n\nModern fast food is a relatively newer category representing a middle ground between traditional fast food and sit-down restaurants. These establishments feature an expanded menu selection priced above traditional fast food options, often incorporating fresher and cleaner ingredients to serve customers prioritizing quality. These eateries are capitalizing on the perception that your drive-through burger and fries joint is detrimental to your health because of inferior ingredients.\n\nSales Growth\n\nChipotle is one of the most widely recognized restaurant chains in the world and benefits from brand equity, giving it customer loyalty and more influence over purchasing decisions.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 15.5% over the last five years was impressive as it added more dining locations and increased sales at existing, established restaurants. Chipotle Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Chipotle reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 18.2%, and its $2.97 billion in revenue exceeded Wall Street's estimates by 1.1%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 13.7% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nSame-store sales growth is a key performance indicator used to measure organic growth and demand for restaurants.\n\nChipotle's demand within its existing restaurants has generally risen over the last two years but lagged behind the broader sector. On average, the company's same-store sales have grown by 7.9% year on year. With positive same-store sales growth amid an increasing number of restaurants, Chipotle is reaching more diners and growing sales. Chipotle Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nIn the latest quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 11.1% year on year. This growth was an acceleration from the 7.4% year-on-year increase it posted 12 months ago, which is always an encouraging sign.\n\nKey Takeaways from Chipotle's Q2 Results\n\nWe were impressed by Chipotle's same-store sales beat vs. expectations this quarter, which drove revenue outperformance. Operating profit was also ahead, showing that the growth was better and it was more efficient growth than expected as well. Zooming out, we think this was a great quarter that shareholders will appreciate. The stock traded up 2.1% to $52.89 immediately after reporting.\n\nChipotle may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly in evening deals on Wednesday, steadying after disappointing earnings from heavyweight technology stocks sparked deep losses on Wall Street.\n\nMajor technology stocks rose in aftermarket trade, seeing a measure of bargain buying after suffering steep losses over the past week. Positive earnings from South Korean memory chip maker SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) also offered some positive signals on artificial intelligence-fueled demand.\n\nBut sentiment remained largely fragile, with uncertainty over the presidential race and an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting also keeping investors cautious.\n\nFocus this week is also on second-quarter gross domestic product data, while the PCE price index- which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge- is due on Friday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,483.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,261.75 points by 20:03 ET (00:03 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 40,188.0 points.\n\nWall St walloped by tech losses after Tesla, Alphabet earnings disappoint\n\nFutures rose marginally after Wall Street clocked deep losses on Wednesday, as underwhelming earnings from heavyweights Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) rattled markets.\n\nTesla steadied in aftermarket trade from a 12.3% slump during the session, as its second-quarter earnings missed estimates. The electric car maker offered middling cues on its plans for full self driving and robotaxis, while investors were unimpressed by CEO Elon Musk flagging progress in developing a humanoid robot, \u201cOptimus.\u201d\n\nAlphabet steadied from a 5% tumble, as signs of slowing advertising revenue and increased expenditure on AI largely offset an earnings beat.\n\nAnalysts were also concerned that the internet giant\u2019s earnings could herald a similar trend in its peers, especially amid fears that the increased spending on AI now appeared to be providing slowing returns.\n\nLosses in the two had spilled over into their peers on Wednesday, dragging Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) down 3.6% and 2.9%, respectively. AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) slumped 6.8%, although all three stocks rose marginally in after-hours trading.\n\nTech was already nursing steep losses over the past weeks, as the sector saw heavy profit-taking after hype over AI drove a major melt-up in valuation over the past year. Expectations of lower interest rates- on which the Fed is set to provide more cues next week- also sparked a rotation into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nThe NASDAQ Composite slumped 3.6% to 17,345.84 points on Wednesday, largely leading losses among its peers. The S&P 500 fell 2.3% to 5,427.13 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3% to 39,853.87 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle, IBM advance on strong Q2; Ford slumps\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) rose 3% after clocking stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter. The fast casual Mexican restaurant chain logged strong comparable restaurant sales in the quarter.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) rose 2.4% after increased interest in AI helped the tech consulting firm log stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.\n\nBut on the other hand, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) slumped over 12% after clocking disappointing earnings, as automobile sales slowed sharply amid decreased consumer spending.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures limp higher after tech rout batters Wall Street\n\nBattery firm LG Energy Solution Q2 profit plunges on weak EV demand\n\nBoeing finalizes 737 MAX guilty plea deal, US outlines reasons\n\nView comments()",

        "content": "Chipotle (CMG) is devouring expectations, even as the restaurant industry struggles with cautious consumers.\n\nOn Wednesday after market close, the burrito chain reported earnings that beat Wall Streets' estimates across the board, including on revenue, earnings, and same-store sales.\n\nRevenue jumped 18.2% year-over-year to $2.97 billion, versus expectations of $2.94 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.34, compared to an estimate of $0.32.\n\nSame-store sales jumped 11.1% year over year, versus the 9.23% Wall Street anticipated. In Q1, same stores sales were up 7%.\n\nCEO Brian Niccol called the quarter \"outstanding,\" thanks to \"successful brand marketing\" alongside the return of the popular Chicken Al Pastor.\n\nFoot traffic jumped 8% in the quarter, more than the 6.3% expected.\n\nPrior to the report, UBS analyst Dennis Geiger called the company \"one of the best positioned concepts to sustain sales momentum in a tough macro given customer brand affinity and a solid value for the money proposition.\"\n\nBut choosier customers and value meals from fast food players like McDonald's (MCD) could pose a threat, wrote Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan in a client note.\n\n\"On the other hand, we'd rather err on the side of caution and view quick-service restaurant's aggressiveness as a near-term (even if on the margin) headwind at Chipotle, Wingstop, and Shake Shack,\" he wrote in a note to clients. SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 01: Workers fill food orders at a Chipotle restaurant on April 01, 2024 in San Rafael, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nBernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo, who has an Outperform rating and price target of $80 on the stock, wrote that there are more levers the fast-casual restaurant could pull to keep the flame burning long-term.\n\nThey include adding late-night or breakfast hours, revamping its loyalty program, and leaning into its Gen Z fans, as the demographic increasingly becomes household decision-makers.\n\nIn June, the company conducted its first 50-for-1 stock split. Shares have since fallen nearly 18% in the last month. Shares jumped roughly 14% in after-hours trading, following the earnings results.\n\nHere's what Chipotle posted in Q2 2024, compared to Bloomberg consensus data:\n\nRevenue: $2.97 billion versus $2.94 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $0.34 versus $0.32 Same-store sales growth: 11.1% versus 9.23%\n\nFor 2024, the company expects sales growth of mid- to high-single digits for the full year, which was up from the previous guidance of mid-single-digit growth set in Q4 of last fiscal year.\n\nChipotle ended Q2 with 3,530 stores, slightly less than the 3,540 locations anticipated. In Q2, Chipotle opened 52 new restaurants, with 46 locations featuring its drive-through Chipotlane. This year, it expects to open 285 to 315 new locations, with more than 80% of them having the drive-through concept. Long term, it plans to operate 7,000 restaurants in North America.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "COMPARABLE SALES INCREASE 11% DRIVEN BY OVER 8% TRANSACTION GROWTH AS MARGINS EXPAND\n\nNEWPORT BEACH, Calif., July 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nSecond quarter highlights, year over year:\n\nTotal revenue increased 18.2% to $3.0 billion Comparable restaurant sales increased 11.1% Operating margin was 19.7%, an increase from 17.2% Restaurant level operating margin was 28.9%1, an increase of 140 basis points Diluted earnings per share was $0.33, a 32.0% increase from $0.25. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excluded a $0.01 after-tax impact from an unrealized loss on a long-term investment and an increase in legal reserves, was $0.341, a 36.0% increase from $0.251 Opened 52 new company-operated restaurants with 46 locations including a Chipotlane, and one international licensed restaurant\n\n\"The second quarter was outstanding as successful brand marketing, including the return of Chicken Al Pastor, drove strong demand to our restaurants. Our focus and training around throughput paid off as we were able to meet the stronger demand trends with terrific service and speed driving over 8% transaction growth in the quarter,\" said Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, Chipotle.\n\nCommon Stock Split Completed\n\nOn June 26, 2024, we executed a 50-for-1 stock split of our common stock with a record date of June 18, 2024, and proportionately increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to reflect the effect of the stock split.\n\nResults for the three months ended June\u00a030, 2024:\n\nTotal revenue in the second quarter was $3.0 billion, an increase of 18.2% compared to the second quarter of 2023. The increase in total revenue was driven by new restaurant openings and an 11.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales due to higher transactions of 8.7% and a 2.4% increase in average check. Digital sales represented 35.3% of total food and beverage revenue.\n\nDuring the second quarter we opened 52 new company-operated restaurants, of which 46 included a Chipotlane, and one international licensed restaurant. These formats continue to perform well and are helping enhance guest access and convenience, as well as increase new restaurant sales, margins, and returns.\n\nFood, beverage and packaging costs in the second quarter of 2024 were 29.4% of total revenue, in line with the second quarter of 2023. The benefit of last year's menu price increase was partially offset by inflation of avocados, and, to a lesser extent, increased oil usage for frying chips and higher incidence of beef as a result of the continued success of our Braised Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative.\n\nStory continues\n\nRestaurant level operating margin in the second quarter was 28.9%1 compared to 27.5%1 in the second quarter of 2023. The improvement was primarily driven by the benefit of sales leverage, partially offset by wage and ingredient inflation.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the second quarter were $175.0 million on a GAAP basis, or $171.3 million1 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding a $3.8 million increase in legal reserves. GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for the second quarter also include $121.9 million of underlying general and administrative expenses, $43.5 million of non-cash stock compensation, and $5.9 million of higher performance-based accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises.\n\nThe effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 25.0% compared to 23.8% in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits related to option exercises and equity vesting, partially offset with a decrease in tax reserves.\n\nNet income for the second quarter was $455.7 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $341.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, excluding the $0.01 after-tax impact from an unrealized loss on a long-term investment and an increase in legal reserves, adjusted net income was $463.0 million1 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.341.\n\nDuring the second quarter we repurchased $151.4 million of stock at an average price per share of $63.52. As of June\u00a030, 2024, $647.7 million remained available under share repurchase authorizations from our Board of Directors, including an additional $400 million in authorized repurchases approved by the Board on June 5, 2024. The repurchase authorization may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.\n\nMore information will be available in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which will be filed with the SEC by the end of July.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, management is anticipating the following:\n\nFull year comparable restaurant sales growth in the mid to high-single digit range 285 to 315 new restaurant openings with over 80% having a Chipotlane An estimated underlying effective full year tax rate between 25% and 27% before discrete items\n\nDefinitions\n\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this release:\n\nComparable restaurant sales, or sales comps, and comparable restaurant transactions, represent the change in period-over-period total revenue or transactions for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months. Average restaurant sales refer to the average trailing 12-month food and beverage revenue for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Restaurant level operating margin represents total revenue less direct restaurant operating costs, expressed as a percent of total revenue. Digital sales represent food and beverage revenue generated through the Chipotle website, Chipotle app or third-party delivery aggregators. Digital sales include revenue deferrals associated with Chipotle Rewards.\n\nConference Call Details\n\nChipotle will host a conference call on Wednesday, July\u00a024, 2024, at 4:30 PM Eastern time to discuss second quarter 2024 financial results as well as provide a business update for the third quarter 2024.\n\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 1-888-317-6003, or for international callers by dialing 1-412-317-6061, and use code: 5419901.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nBelow are definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures in this release. The following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAdjusted net income is net income excluding expenses related to restaurant and corporate asset impairment, corporate restructuring, certain legal proceedings, and loss on investments. Adjusted general and administrative expense is general and administrative expense excluding expenses related to corporate restructuring and certain legal proceedings. The adjusted effective income tax rate is the effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the after tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments. Restaurant Level Operating Margin is equal to the revenues generated by our restaurants less their direct operating costs which consist of food, beverage and packaging, labor, occupancy and other operating costs. This performance measure primarily includes the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other costs that are essential to conduct our business. Management uses restaurant level operating margin as a measure of restaurant performance. Management believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP measures in order to facilitate meaningful evaluation of our operating performance across periods. These adjustments are intended to provide greater transparency of underlying performance and to allow investors to evaluate our business on the same basis as our management, which uses these non-GAAP measures in evaluating the company's performance. Our adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted effective income tax rate and restaurant level operating margin measures may not be comparable to other companies' adjusted measures. These adjustments are not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial performance would have been during the periods presented and should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further details regarding these adjustments are included in the tables below.\n\nCHIPOTLE MEXICAN GRILL, INC.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\n\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\n(unaudited) Three months ended June 30, 2024 2023 Net income $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 455,671 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 341,790 Non-GAAP adjustments: Impairment and exit costs: Restaurant asset impairment and other restaurant exit costs(1) - 4,765 Corporate asset impairment(2) - 3,735 Corporate Restructuring: Employee related and other restructuring costs(3) - 3,495 Legal proceedings(4) 3,775 - Investment(5) 6,016 - Total non-GAAP adjustments 9,791 11,995 Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments above(6) (2,471) (2,891) After tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments 7,320 9,104 Adjusted net income $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 462,991 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 350,894 Diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 1,381,518 1,387,372 Diluted earnings per share $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.33 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.25 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.34 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.25\n\n(1) Operating lease asset and leasehold improvements, property, plant and equipment impairment charges and other expenses for restaurants due to closures, relocations, or underperformance.

        "title": "These Are the 3 Fastest-Growing Stock-Split Stocks on the Planet",
        "content": "Since 2023 began, excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has sent all three of Wall Street's major stock indexes to fresh record-closing highs. But while AI seemingly gets all the credit, companies enacting stock splits have quickly become one of the stock market's hottest trends.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies to cosmetically adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. Splits are purely superficial in the sense that they don't affect a company's market cap or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStocks splits fall into two categories -- forward and reverse -- with investors undeniably favoring the former.\n\nWith a reverse-stock split, a company is increasing its share price, often with the goal of maintaining the minimum continued listing standards of a major stock exchange. In other words, reverse-stock splits are normally conducted from a position of operating weakness.\n\nBy comparison, companies completing forward-stock splits are purposely making their shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors and their employees. Businesses that need to conduct forward splits are usually highly innovative and out-executing their competition.\n\nSince this year began, around a dozen high-profile companies have announced their intent to split. But not all stock-split stocks are created equally.\n\nBased on consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts, three \"Class of 2024\" stock-split stocks are expected to grow their earnings per share (EPS) by at least 151% by 2028. In other words, the following three brand-name businesses are the fastest-growing stock-split stocks on the planet!\n\nNvidia: Forecast EPS growth of 383% by 2028\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that the fastest-growing stock-split stock of them all, based on Wall Street's consensus forecast, is leading AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Between fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), where Nvidia reported $1.30 per share in earnings, and fiscal 2029, Nvidia's EPS is expected to catapult by 383% to $6.28.\n\nThere's absolutely no question that artificial intelligence is the driving force behind this otherworldly earnings growth forecast, as well as Nvidia's much needed 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed in June. In short order, Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) became the most-desired AI-GPUs for enterprise data centers looking to train large language models and run generative AI solutions. An analysis by TechInsights found that Nvidia had a 98% share of all AI-GPUs shipped in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nCEO Jensen Huang is intent on his company maintaining its first-mover and compute advantages in AI-accelerated data centers. While most of its competitors are trying to catch up to the H100, Nvidia is readying for the launch of its next-gen GPU architecture known as Blackwell. The Blackwell platform is expected to accelerate computing in a half-dozen arenas, including quantum computing, generative AI solutions, and data processing.\n\nDemand is another key reason Nvidia's profits and adjusted gross margin have ascended to the heavens. With demand for its hardware easily outstripping supply, Nvidia has had no trouble substantially increasing the selling price of its GPUs.\n\nBut while this forecast looks phenomenal on paper, Wall Street analysts appear to be ignoring the role history has played in next-big-thing innovations. Despite the game-changing potential of artificial intelligence, there hasn't been a single buzzworthy trend for 30 years that's avoided an early innings bubble. Professional and everyday investors have a habit of overestimating the utility of new technologies, and it's unlikely that AI will break this trend.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia's external and internal competition is picking up in a big way. Even if the company's Blackwell platform helps it to maintain its compute advantage, the GPU scarcity that's driven its pricing power into the stratosphere will ebb. Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill: Forecast EPS growth of 151% by 2028\n\nAnother of the fastest-growing stock-split stocks on the planet is fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Chipotle, which completed its historic 50-for-1 forward split following the closing bell on June 25, is expected to see its annual earnings per share catapult from a reported $0.90 in 2023 to an estimated $2.26 by 2028. This would represent a cool 151% EPS growth, for those of you keeping score at home.\n\nOne reason Chipotle Mexican Grill has been able to consistently outpace its fast-casual restaurant competition in terms of organic growth is its pricing power. This pricing power derives from the company's promise to use locally sources vegetables (when cost-effective) and responsibly raised meats that are free of unnecessary antibiotics. Management has understood for a long time that customers will pay more for higher-quality food.\n\nTo build on the above point, Chipotle's success is a reflection of its menu remaining limited in size. By keeping its menu small, the company's staff can prepare food fresh every day, as well as expedite orders in its stores. Having a small menu also gives new food items more pop when they debut.\n\nOut-of-the-box innovation has been vital to Chipotle's success, as well. In 2018, the company began introducing its digital drive-thru lanes, known as \"Chipotlanes.\" These mobile order-dedicated lanes were a big reason for Chipotle's success during the pandemic.\n\nPerhaps the biggest headwind for Chipotle's stock is simply the euphoria of its investors. Although Chipotle's sales jumped by 14.1% during the March-ended quarter from the prior-year period, a little over half of this growth came from new store openings. Organic growth chimed in at 7% for existing locations.\n\nNormally, 7% organic growth for a large fast-casual restaurant chain would be fantastic. But with Chipotle valued at 40 times forward-year earnings, a 7% organic growth rate doesn't cut it. Even with its clear-cut competitive advantages, Chipotle has a lot of work to do to grow into its current valuation.\n\nBroadcom: Forecast EPS growth of 185% by 2028\n\nThe third fastest-growing stock-split stock on the planet is none other than networking solutions specialist Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), which completed its very first split (10-for-1) following the close of business on July 12. After reporting an adjusted $4.23 in EPS in fiscal 2023 (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Wall Street's consensus calls for a whopping $12.06 in EPS in fiscal 2028. This would work out to earnings growth of 185% over five years.\n\nA sizable percentage of Broadcom's recent growth has come from AI -- more specifically, its AI networking ties. Last year, Broadcom introduced its Jericho3-AI fabric, which can connect up to 32,000 GPUs in high-compute data centers. Broadcom's solutions are necessary to reduce tail latency and maximize the compute capacity of the GPUs deployed, which are mostly H100's from Nvidia at the moment.\n\nThere's even been rumored discussions between OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and Broadcom about developing their own data center AI chip. With AI-GPU demand outpacing supply, the market is ripe for competitors to Nvidia's H100.\n\nHowever, Broadcom has more going on than just its AI-focused operations. For instance, it's a major supplier of wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones. The 5G revolution provided the impetus for consumers and businesses to upgrade their wireless devices and take advantage of faster download speeds.\n\nIn November, we also witnessed Broadcom close its $69 billion acquisition of VMware. This deal expands its reach in enterprise software solutions and supports its multi-cloud growth strategy.\n\nBroadcom is, by far, the cheapest of the three fastest-growing stock-split stocks, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26. Thanks to its multitude of sales channels beyond AI, it would be in far better shape than Nvidia if history rhymes and the AI bubble does burst.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Time to Buy Chipotle's Stock as Much Anticipated Q2 Earnings Approach?",
        "content": "In its first earnings report since a historic 50-1 stock split last month, Chipotle Mexican Grill\u00a0 CMG will report Q2 results on Wednesday, July 24.\n\nWall Street and of course retail investors will be scoping the retail restaurant giant\u2019s Q2 report with its stock trading at a much more affordable price tag of $52 compared to over $3,000 pre-split. Seeing as the underlying fundamentals of a company don\u2019t change when its stock splits, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s time to buy CMG as earnings approach.\n\nQ2 Expectations for CMG\n\nAs mentioned, financial figures like Chipotle\u2019s actual operating profit are not affected by a stock split but EPS is adjusted to reflect the increased number of shares. In this regard Chipotle is expected to post Q2 earnings of $0.31 per share which would be a 24% increase from $0.25 a share (EPS of $12.50/50) in the comparative quarter.\n\nQuarterly sales are projected to rise 17% to $2.94 billion versus $2.51 billion a year ago. Notably, Chipotle has exceeded top and bottom line expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports posting an average earnings surprise of 8.33%.\n\nRecent Growth Drivers\n\nDuring Q1 Chipotle highlighted successful marketing campaigns as a key contributor to its sales growth this year, including spotlighting barbacoa and the return of Chicken al Pastor as a limited-time offer. Furthermore, digital sales from online orders have been a further catalyst to Chipotle's growth making up 37% of its revenue during Q1.\n\nMarketing barbacoa, a unique traditional Caribbean-style method of cooking meat also comes at a much-needed time as many consumers are becoming more familiar with Cava Group CAVA, a Mediterranean-style restaurant and growing competitor that offers a build-your-own-bowl model similar to Chipotle.\n\nPost-Split Performance\n\nSince its stock split on June 26, CMG shares have fallen -20% to underperform the S&P 500\u2019\u2019s +1% with it noteworthy that this has also trailed McDonald\u2019s MCD virtually flat performance and Cava Group\u2019s -10%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMonitoring CMG\u2019s Valuation\n\nAt current levels, CMG trades at a 48.4X forward earnings multiple which is still a noticeable premium to the broader market. However, CMG does trade attractively below its decade-long high of 231.1X forward earnings while offering a slight discount to the median of 50.4X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile it may be too soon to say a post-split rebound is in store for Chipotle\u2019s stock, CMG lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Now more than ever, investors will want to see Chipotle\u2019s attractive growth trajectory is still intact when it reports Q2 results. To that point, CMG's stock price is far more reasonable but its valuation is not cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Chipotle expected to post big Q2 earnings as it remains competitive on value",
        "content": "Chipotle (CMG) is expected to maintain its industry-leading position, amid a difficult restaurant landscape with consumers tightening their wallets.\n\nThe California-based burrito chain is set to report earnings Wednesday after market close. Wall Street expects another robust quarter, with $2.94 billion in revenue, up 17% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.32, up 25% year over year.\n\nFoot traffic is expected to be 6.3% higher, but the average check size is only expected to grow 2.63%.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Lauren Silberman expects sales growth this quarter to be the \"highest of the year.\"\n\n\"Though traffic and same-store sales should remain strong in the second half of the year, supported by a strong innovation and marketing pipeline, while throughput remains one of the most meaningful multi-year traffic drivers,\" she wrote in a note to clients.\n\nUBS analyst Dennis Geiger called the company \"one of the best positioned concepts to sustain sales momentum in a tough macro given customer brand affinity and a solid value for the money proposition.\"\n\nBut choosier customers and value meals from fast food players like McDonald's (MCD) could pose a threat, wrote Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan in a client note.\n\n\"On the other hand, we'd rather err on the side of caution and view quick-service restaurant's aggressiveness as a near-term (even if on the margin) headwind at Chipotle, Wingstop, and Shake Shack,\" he wrote in a note to clients. SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 01: Workers fill food orders at a Chipotle restaurant on April 01, 2024 in San Rafael, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nBernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo, who has an Outperform rating and price target of $80 on the stock, wrote that there are more levers the fast-casual restaurant could pull to keep the flame burning long-term.\n\nThey include adding late-night or breakfast hours, revamping its loyalty program, and leaning into its Gen Z fans, as the demographic increasingly becomes household decision-makers.\n\nThis quarter, some on Wall Street had their eyes on portion sizes at Chipotle, like Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem, who tracked the portion size at eight Chipotle locations in New York City and ordered the same burrito bowl 75 times.\n\nOthers think the company will ride out the wave, without a hiccup.\n\n\"I don't think consumers are really going to stop going to Chipotle because they feel like their bowls are a little smaller,\" BTIG's Peter Saleh told Yahoo Finance over the phone. He said customers will likely ask for more if they want it.\n\n\"This is going to be short lived, this issue or this social media, kind-of, pushback,\" Saleh added.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q2, the company conducted its first 50-for-1 stock split. Shares have since fallen nearly 18% in the last month to nearly $53.\n\nHere's what Wall Street expects from Chipotle in Q2 2024, based on Bloomberg consensus data, compared to Q2 2023:\n\nRevenue: $2.94 billion compared to $2.5 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $0.32 compared to $0.25 ($12.32 before stock split) Same-store sales growth: 9.23% compared to 7.4%\n\nAs of Q1, the company expects sales growth of mid- to high-single digits for the full year, which was up from the previous guidance of mid-single-digit growth.\n\nWall Street expects the company to end Q2 with a total of 3,540 locations. In Q1, Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants, with 43 locations featuring its drive-through Chipotlane. This year, it expects to open 285 to 315 new locations, with more than 80% of them having the drive-through concept. Long term, it plans to operate 7,000 restaurants in North America.\n\nFollowing Q1, CEO Brian Niccol told investors the results provide \"confidence that we can achieve our long-term target of more than doubling our business in North America and expanding internationally.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "2 Magnificent S&amp;P 500 Stocks Down 20% to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is one of the most referenced measures in investing. This index includes 500 of the world's largest publicly traded companies and is often used as a proxy for how the overall stock market is performing. The index isn't just 500 random companies, but rather ones that are large enough and have met certain key criteria such as sustained profitability.\n\nWhile companies in the S&P 500 are generally strong businesses, even the best can go through rough stretches. Using the index as a starting point and searching for stocks that have fallen can be an interesting way to look for investment opportunities. Here are two stocks in the S&P 500 that have fallen at least 20% and why they are worth buying now and holding forever.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nMexican fast-casual restaurant Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) has been among the best-performing restaurant stocks ever. A $1,000 investment at its initial public offering (IPO) would be worth $61,000 today. However, over the past month, the stock is down 22%. This quick drop is even more interesting considering there's been no major news or earnings reported.\n\nGiven the business results, today's price could be a compelling buying opportunity. In the most recently reported quarter, the first quarter of 2024, Chipotle's revenue grew 14% year over year while its earnings per share (EPS) increased by 24%. This was a continuation of what has been a multiyear stretch of growth on both the top and bottom lines. CMG Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nWhat's impressive about this is the fact that the revenue growth has come both from new stores and also steadily increasing comparable restaurant sales. In Q1, Chipotle grew its comparable restaurant sales by 7% and its total store count by 8%.\n\nThese results are in line with the last several quarters and demonstrate the strength of the business as well as the room it has to continue to grow. Chipotle has a long-term goal of reaching 7,000 stores, which would be more than double the current store count.\n\nPayPal\n\nWhen it comes to digital payments, PayPal(NASDAQ: PYPL) could be the best-known player in the space. Its namesake product was one of the earliest success stories when it came to online payments as well as peer-to-peer money transfers. Considering the company also owns Venmo, anyone who's sent or received money from a friend has used a PayPal product.\n\nDespite its market share, the company itself has been on a bumpy road for the last several years. Between being acquired and then spun off by eBay and the roller-coaster ride during the pandemic, PayPal has had anything but a smooth path in the public markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut now, the company is under new management that is focused on steadying the ship. PayPal has shifted its focus from acquiring new customers to better engaging its highly engaged users. It's early days of this new strategy, but there are signs it's bearing fruit.\n\nIn Q1 2024, active accounts decreased by 1% year over year, continuing a trend seen over the last few quarters. This sounds bad but was expected as the company acknowledged it would be shedding less-engaged users.\n\nOn the flip side, payment transactions increased by 11% and transactions per active account grew by 13%. This demonstrated that even with a shrinking user base, the remaining accounts are engaged and increasing their use of the platform.\n\nPayPal shares are down 22% from their 2023 high but the company seems to be getting back on track. There's a case to be made for stronger results moving forward and today's price may turn out to be a nice buying opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chipotle (CMG) Reports Earnings Tomorrow: What To Expect\n\nMexican fast-food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) will be reporting earnings tomorrow after the bell. Here's what investors should know.\n\nChipotle beat analysts' revenue expectations by 1.2% last quarter, reporting revenues of $2.70 billion, up 14.1% year on year. It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' gross margin estimates and a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nIs Chipotle a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Chipotle's revenue to grow 17% year on year to $2.94 billion, improving from the 13.6% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.32 per share. Chipotle Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Chipotle has missed Wall Street's revenue estimates five times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Chipotle's peers in the restaurants segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Darden delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 6.8%, meeting analysts' expectations, and Domino's reported revenues up 7.1%, in line with consensus estimates. Darden's stock price was unchanged after the resultswhile Domino's was down 14.6%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Darden's results here and Domino's results here.\n\nGrowth stocks have been quite volatile since the start of 2024, and while some of the restaurants stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share prices down 3.3% on average over the last month. Chipotle is down 16% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $66.4 (compared to the current share price of $53.65).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future.

        "title": "Reinsurance Group and Brown-Forman have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Reinsurance Group of America's RGA as the Bull of the Day and Brown-Forman (BF.B) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Wingstop Inc. WING and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nAs one of the largest global life and health reinsurance companies, Reinsurance Group of America's stock has soared over +30% YTD and the rally could continue as its Q2 results approach on August 1st.\n\nBoasting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), RGA lands the Bull of the Day and has an overall \"A\" VGM Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nGrowth in Asia\n\nNotably, the United States is the world's largest reinsurance market, which fosters RGA's robust top and bottom lines along with its presence as a market leader in the United Kingdom and Canada as well.\n\nHowever, RGA's expansion in Asia has led to a record quantity of new business that should continue fueling the company's growth. Honk Kong, RGA's largest Asian market has seen increased volumes of Mainland Chinese visitors buying life insurance.\n\nOutside of China, RGA secured a $4.7 billion deal in Japan during the first quarter, stating it launched one of its prominent Japanese insurance products to a major insurer in Korea as well.\n\nQ2 Expectations for RGA\n\nFor the second quarter, RGA's sales are thought to have spiked 15% year over year to $4.92 billion with Q2 EPS projected to rise 12% to $4.94. More intriguing, The Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) also indicates RGA could surpass earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS slated at $5.08 and roughly 3% above the Zacks Consensus.\n\nRGA has surpassed earnings expectations for five consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 19.48% in its last four quarterly reports. This comes as RGA posted record quarterly EPS of $6.02 in Q1.\n\nAttractive Growth & Valuation\n\nAs shown in the EPS Before Non-Recurring Items (BNRI) chart below, RGA's profitability has continued to reach new heights following the pandemic.\n\nOverall, RGA's annual earnings are now expected to be up 6% in fiscal 2024 and are forecasted to rise another 4% in FY25 to a whopping $22.02 per share. RGA's top line has been at record levels as well and total sales are expected to expand another 13% this year and projected to be slightly higher in FY25 with projections north of $21 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nMaking RGA's growth more attractive is that its stock trades at 10.1X forward earnings which is a lucrative discount to the S&P 500's 23.2X, despite impressively outperforming the broader market in recent years.\n\nPlus, RGA still trades 65% below its decade-long high of 29.1X forward earnings and offers a slight discount to the median of 11.2X.\n\nBottom Line\n\nReinsurance Group of America's dominance in various global markets has been very impressive and exhilarating to investors. Furthermore, the impeccable rally in RGA shares could very well continue considering its cheap P/E valuation and expansive EPS growth.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nNowadays it seems like every ultra-famous celebrity has their own whisky line, leading to increased competition for Brown-Forman and its iconic Jack Daniel's brand.\n\nWhile Brown-Forman is one of the largest producers in the spirits and wine business, the company has grappled with supply chain disruptions along with the impact of higher inflation and interest rates.\n\nLanding a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day, it may be best to avoid Brown-Forman's stock at the moment.\n\nPoor Price Performance\n\nAttributed to the growing alternatives regarding whiskey brands and its choppy operating environment, Brown-Forman's stock has fallen -23% year to date and plummeted -37% over the last year.\n\nSubpar Outlook\n\nAlthough Brown-Forman believes its turnaround is ahead, the company still expects a volatile operating environment due to global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nTo that point, earnings for Brown-Forman's current fiscal 2025 are expected to decline -13% to $1.85 versus $2.14 per share in FY24. Brown-Forman's bottom line is expected to rebound and rise 5% in FY26 but it's noteworthy that earnings estimate revisions are noticeably lower over the last 60 days.\n\nFurthermore, Brown-Forman's sales growth doesn't necessarily sway investors to think its future earnings potential will be lucrative once its higher operating costs and expenses normalize.\n\nValuation Concerns\n\nConsidering its mediocre top line expansion, Brown-Forman's stock trades at a high price-to-sales valuation of 4.9X compared to the Zacks Beverages-Alcohol Industry average of 1.6X which is closer to the optimum level of less than 1X.\n\nMore concerning is that amid its lowered profitability (and poor stock performance), BF. B still trades at a 23.7X forward earnings multiple which doesn't offer a discount to the S&P 500's 23.2X. Plus, this is a premium to the industry average of 17.3X forward earnings.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBrown-Forman's stock has been on a slippery downward slope and a rebound doesn't look likely at this point, especially as there are competition issues to address on top of broader economic factors.\n\nAdditional content:\n\n3 Restaurant Stocks Set to \"Deliver\" Q2 Earnings Beats\n\nRestaurant companies' second-quarter 2024 results are likely to be bolstered by increased menu prices, higher average check sizes and expansion initiatives. Many restaurant companies benefited from partnerships with delivery services and digital platforms.\n\nRestaurant operators have been focused on digital innovation, sales-building strategies and cost-saving measures. Digital innovation has become crucial, with partnerships with delivery services like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats playing a significant role in boosting sales. The introduction of self-service kiosks and loyalty programs bodes well.\n\nThe industry players are likely to have benefited from the rise in off-premise sales, including delivery, takeout, drive-thru, catering, meal kits, and off-site options like kiosks and food trucks in the second quarter. Many operators also tested ghost or virtual kitchens, which have received positive customer feedback. The combination of off-premise offerings and connected curbside services has further driven customer satisfaction and industry growth.\n\nThe latest Earnings Trend report suggests that the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector's second-quarter earnings are expected to increase 7.3% from the year-ago period's reported figure. The previous quarter recorded a 28.1% increase. The sector's revenues are projected to increase 4.4%, compared with 5% reported in the previous quarter. However, margins are expected to increase 0.2%. Companies from the restaurant industry, like BJ's Restaurants, Inc., Wingstop Inc. and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. are expected to beat estimates in the ongoing reporting cycle.\n\nHowever, high costs are likely to have negatively impacted the companies margin to some extent in second-quarter 2024. Intense competition, high wages and food cost inflation are concerning. The industry continues to bear increased expenses, which have been affecting margins. Higher pre-opening costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives have been exerting pressure on the company's margins.\n\nHow to Make the Right Pick?\n\nGiven the wide range of companies in this space, the task is by no means easy. While it is impossible to be sure of the outperformers, our proprietary methodology \u2014 a positive Earnings ESP along with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) \u2014 makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks with high chances of delivering a surprise in their upcoming earnings announcements. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the abovementioned combination, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.\n\nOur Choices\n\nHere we discuss in detail the three above-mentioned restaurant companies that are likely to beat estimates this time around.\n\nBJ's Restaurants is scheduled to report second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 25. BJRI currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +9.25%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nBJ's Restaurants' second-quarter top line is likely to have been aided by productivity and margin enhancement initiatives and operational excellence across its restaurants. Also, the company's expansion and, remodeling and digital initiatives are encouraging.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at 49 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 2% from 50 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nWingstop is slated to report fiscal second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jul 31. WING currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.03% and a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nThe company's second-quarter results are likely to benefit from delivery channel expansion, menu innovation and digital marketing initiatives. Also, its supply-chain strategy and robust unit economics are adding to the positives.\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings is pegged at 80 cents per share, suggesting growth of 40.4% from 57 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nChipotle is scheduled to report second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 24. CMG currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.72% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nChipotle's second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from its digital efforts, Chipotlane add-ons and marketing initiatives. These, along with strength in digital sales and new restaurant openings, have been driving the company.\n\nWe expect food and beverage revenues to increase 16.2% year over year to $2,901.2 million. Moreover, delivery service revenues are expected to be $19.3 million, up 11.5% year over year.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at 31 cents per share, suggesting growth of 24% from 25 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "Should You Bet on Chipotle (CMG) Stock Ahead of Q2 Earnings?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG is slated to release results for second-quarter 2024 on Jul 24, after the market close.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, the company\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15%. The company\u2019s top and the bottom line increased 14.1% and 27.3% year over year, respectively. Chipotle enhanced throughput and effective marketing initiatives like Braised Beef Barbacoa and Chicken Al Pastor, leading to strong sales and transaction growth.\r\n\r\nCMG has an impressive track record of surpassing earnings expectations, exceeding the consensus mark in each of the last four quarters. The average surprise over this period is 8.3%, as shown in the chart below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTrend in Estimate Revision\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) has remained unchanged at 31 cents in the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 24% increase from the year-ago EPS of 25 cents. Also, the consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $2.93 billion, indicating 16.6% year-over-year growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Chipotle this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Chipotle has an Earnings ESP of +0.83%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors Influencing Q2 Performance\n\nChipotle's second-quarter performance is anticipated to show year-over-year growth, driven by its digital initiatives, the addition of Chipotlane drive-thrus and new restaurant openings. CMG\u2019s focus on advertising effectively boosted brand visibility, relevance and popularity, contributing positively to its performance.\r\n\r\nStrong comparable sales growth, fueled by higher transaction volumes and increased average checks, is another key factor in the company\u2019s success. This, combined with robust digital sales, is bolstering its overall performance. Our model projects an 8.9% year-over-year increase in comparable sales for second-quarter 2024.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of new menu items is likely to have spurred transactions during the second quarter. Our model estimates a 16.2% year-over-year rise in food and beverage revenues, reaching $2.9 billion. Delivery service revenues are projected to increase 11.5% year over year, totaling $19.3 million.\r\n\r\nHowever, rising costs are expected to have impacted the company's margins. Inflation in beef and produce prices, along with challenges in the protein mix due to the Braised Beef Barbacoa promotion, likely increased costs in the second quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nOur model predicts food, beverage, and packaging costs to rise 16.5% year over year to $860.3 million. Labor costs are also expected to increase 17.2% year over year, reaching $716.9 million. Despite these higher costs, we anticipate a restaurant-level margin of 28.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nChipotle has shown resilience despite market volatility, delivering significant returns to investors. The stock has notably outperformed its industry peers and the broader S&P 500 index. Year to date, the stock has increased 17.1% against the industry\u2019s 9.4% decline. The company also outperformed other industry players like Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI, down 13%, Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ, down 2%, and Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR, down 6.9%.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet's assess the value CMG offers to investors at its current levels.\r\n\r\nFrom the valuation point of view, the stock is trading at a premium. Chipotle\u2019s forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio stands at 43.51, significantly higher than the industry\u2019s ratio of 21.76 and the S&P 500's ratio of 21.48. This suggests that investors may be paying a high price relative to the company's expected earnings growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thoughts\n\nCMG is well-positioned for long-term growth, supported by robust digitalization, strategic initiatives and strong financial fundamentals. Recently, the company executed a 50-1 stock split, which, while not affecting its market valuation, made its shares more affordable and accessible to investors who previously found them too expensive.\r\n\r\nDespite the stock split, Chipotle's shares have pulled back in the past month, declining 16.2%. This drop is primarily due to an online customer backlash over claims that the company reduced portion sizes while increasing prices. Although management denies reducing portions, they have acknowledged raising prices to offset inflation and higher input costs.\r\n\r\nCurrent shareholders should hold onto their positions, while prospective investors might consider waiting for a more favorable entry point, given the stock's high valuation. The lack of positive EPS estimate revisions over the past 60 days suggests that analysts are currently not very optimistic about the stock at the moment.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Starbucks (SBUX) shares rallied 6.9% in the last trading session to close at $79.27. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 6.9% loss over the past four weeks.\n\nShares of Starbucks jumped after Elliott Investment Management purchased a sizeable minority stake in the coffee chain. Per the report, the purchase has given a gentle push to the stock price performance, which has been navigating a challenged environment accompanied by pressures including declining sales, wages and promotional activity.\n\nThis coffee chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6%. Revenues are expected to be $9.24 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWhile earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Starbucks, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on SBUX going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nStarbucks is a member of the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry. One other stock in the same industry, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), finished the last trading session 0.3% higher at $53.54. CMG has returned -17% over the past month.\n\nFor Chipotle , the consensus EPS estimate for the upcoming report has changed -0.8% over the past month to $0.31. This represents a change of +24% from what the company reported a year ago. Chipotle currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "U.S. stocks ended Friday trading in the red as Wall Street concluded a week characterized by a shift from this year\u2019s megacap winners to smaller names.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell by 0.71%, closing at 5,505.00. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.81%, ending at 17,726.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 377.49 points, or 0.93%, to 40,287.53.\n\nFriday\u2019s declines were widespread, with the Russell 2000 also down by 0.63%. Despite this, the focus on stocks expected to benefit more from potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, such as small caps, remained prominent throughout the week.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced their largest weekly losses since April, falling by 1.97% and 3.65%, respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also ended a six-week winning streak. On the other hand, the Dow gained 0.72%, and the small-cap index Russell 2000 rose by 1.68%.\n\nThe upcoming week promises to be eventful, with several key economic indicators set to be released. The main focus will likely be on the preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data for the second quarter, scheduled for Thursday, with many economists expecting an uptick.\n\nFurthermore, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, one of the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauges, will be released on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe expect a modest acceleration from the 1.5% growth pace in 1Q to 2.0% last quarter,\u201d JPMorgan economists said in a note.\n\n\u201cFriday\u2019s June core PCE inflation report is expected to show a 0.2%m/m increase in prices last month, leaving the year-ago increase unchanged at 2.6%,\u201d they added.\n\nApart from this, investors will closely monitor the presidential election, especially following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race. His decision opens the possibility of an open convention, although the consensus is that U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is the frontrunner for the nomination.\n\nAlphabet and Tesla to report earnings this week\n\nAs earnings season begins, the tech-focused S&P 500 faces challenges not only from the rotation into small caps but also from potential selling pressure from trend followers.\n\nThis week, several big S&P 500 companies are set to unveil their latest quarterly performance, and with the current high expectations, any misses could prompt trend followers to sell off their stretched long positions accumulated over the past two months, and weigh further on the benchmark index.\n\nTech giants including Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will both report on Tuesday, and will likely capture the majority of the spotlight. In addition, Visa (NYSE:V), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), 3M, and chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) will also report earnings in the coming days.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nJPMorgan: \u201cMag-7 EPS growth projections remain punchy, but are set to decelerate somewhat. SPX ex Mag-7 earnings are projected to be positive at +5% y/y, for the first time in 5 quarters. However, we note that the convergence in the earnings delivery was the expectation in each of the last 5 reporting seasons, but the end result was always a bigger positive surprise for Mag-7 than for the rest of the market. This could be the case in the current reporting season, yet again. Within Tech, we reiterate the call from last month to move away from hardware/semis, and into software, on lower yields, on geopolitical uncertainty and given strong past outperformance of Semis.\n\nUBS: \u201cOur base case that the S&P 500 ends the year around 5,900, modestly higher than the current 5,505, would hold in most political scenarios\u2014 barring a Democratic sweep of power that leads to higher corporate taxes, or a scenario in which former President Trump imposes trade tariffs that are as high as proposed in his campaign speeches. We consider either outcome unlikely at present. In addition, we believe the positive outlook for top US tech companies is likely to more than offset political uncertainty.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo: \u201cPresident Biden has withdrawn from the presidential election following the continued erosion of his support and has endorsed VP Harris as the nominee. Could see modest give-back of \"Trump Trade\" but path likely becomes data-dependent from there.\u201d\n\nLynx Equity Strategies: \u201cWe think the sell-off from last week is likely to reverse somewhat this week. The SOX (vs. SPX outperformance) has cut below a reliable level. The fate of the sector will of course be decided by the earnings reports, the bulk of which arrive only next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cTriggering FDPR is a major change in US trade policy towards nations allied with the US. We think it is unlikely the Biden administration makes major changes to trade policy through the remaining portion of its tenure. As such we think investor fears of draconian changes to US policy towards China exports by US and non-US based companies is likely to ebb. We would be buyers of semis/semicap names.\u201d\n\nYardeni Research: \u201cIt's all quite confusing since investors have been rotating out of Tech and the Magnificent-7 since July 11 when June's lower-than-expect CPI convinced investors to load up on interest-rate sensitive stocks because the Fed is now widely expected to start lowering interest rates in September. We agree, but we also think that could be a one-and-done rate cut for 2024 because the economy remains resilient. For now, we believe that the stock market was overbought and is experiencing a minor selloff.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTSX opens higher after Biden opts out of election race\n\nWall St opens higher as investors assess U.S. election after Biden exit",

        "title": "Joe Biden dropout fallout, inflation data, and the start of tech earnings: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks pulled back from record highs amid pressure across the technology sector after a global tech outage sent shockwaves throughout the market on Friday.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the week down nearly 2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped more than 3.5% on the week. Both indexes had their worst weekly performance since April. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.7%.\n\nThis week, critical readings on economic growth and inflation, as well as the start of Big Tech earnings, will determine if the malaise continues.\n\nInvestors will also be digesting the news that President Joe Biden will no longer be seeking reelection. Biden announced he\u2018s dropping out of the presidental race in a post on X Sunday.\n\nOn the economic data side, the advanced reading of second quarter economic growth is slated for Thursday, followed by the June reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, a slew of S&P 500 companies are expected to report quarterly results in a week headlined by Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), and Chipotle (CMG).\n\nInflation outlook\n\nLast week, new data showing a slowdown in inflation prompted markets to put the chances that the Federal Reserve cuts rates by the end of its September meeting at 100%.\n\nThe week ahead will bring another look at inflation, this time with the Fed's preferred gauge: The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index.\n\nDue out on Friday, economists expect \"core\" PCE increased 2.5% in June from the previous year, down from May's 2.6% annual gain. Over the prior month, economists expect \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%, slightly above May's 0.1% increase.\n\nThe release comes less than a week before the Fed's next monetary policy decision on July 31. Markets are widely expecting the central bank to hold interest rates steady. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies during the House Financial Services Committee hearing titled \"Federal Reserve's Semi-Annual Monetary Policy Report\" in Rayburn building on Wednesday, July 10, 2024. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)\n\nGrowth check\n\nOne key question on investors' minds is whether the economy can remain resilient with rates still at their most restrictive levels in more than two decades.\n\nThursday will bring the first reading of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter. Economists expect the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 1.9% in the second quarter, up from the 1.4% growth rate seen in the first quarter.\n\nBank of America Securities head of economics Michael Gapen summed up expectations for the upcoming week's data release in a weekly note, writing,\" The data should show healthy activity, and that inflation is moving in the right direction.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSigns of a rotation\n\nSince investors have become more optimistic about the likelihood of multiple interest rate cuts this year, a shift has been underway within the stock market.\n\nIn the past 10 days, Real Estate (XLRE) and Financials (XLF) have led individual sector action. Meanwhile the market's biggest winners of the past year, Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) , have recently been the worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500.\n\nAnd the rotation has finally trickled down in cap size too, with small caps joining the 2024 stock market rally.\n\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) is up about 8% over the past month, while the S&P 500 is up less than 1% in the same time period, sparking debate over whether this bout of small-cap outperformance can continue.\n\n\"We think there is room for the rotation into low quality to persist if rate cuts remain priced and the Trump 2.0 trade carries on ahead of US elections,\" UBS Investment Bank US equity derivatives strategist Maxwell Grinacoff wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\nBig Tech earnings on tap\n\nWith Big Tech stumbling amid the market rotation, the fundamental story for some of the stock market's largest names will be in focus in the week ahead.\n\nTesla and Alphabet are slated to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday. Second quarter results from the two Magnificent Seven members will provide an early read on investor appetite for the most popular trade of 2023. Both stocks are up double digits over the past six months despite the recent sell-off.\n\nThe question is whether the AI-fueled trajectory upward can continue.\n\n\"The biggest risk heading into the next six to eight weeks is, are we setting ourselves up for this AI disappointment [in earnings]?\" Ryan Grabinski, Strategas Research Partners managing director of investment strategy, told Yahoo Finance. \"Do all of the trades that were associated with AI ultimately begin to unwind themselves?\"\n\nHow Big Tech companies perform will likely determine the trajectory of earnings growth for the broader S&P 500. Four companies \u2014 Alphabet, Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) \u2014 are expected to grow earnings by 56.4% compared to the same period a year prior, according to FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Chipotle Mexican Grill vs. Cava Group",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) is probably best known for its assembly line-style fresh food preparation. Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) has also built its foundation on the same concept, but with the distinction that Chipotle focuses on Mexican food while Cava specializes in Mediterranean fare. The latter, of course, is a much smaller chain, which makes the comparison with Chipotle extra interesting. Which is a better investment right now?\n\nChipotle is a huge success story\n\nEvery restaurant chain starts from modest beginnings, but not every restaurant chain can grow to have 3,500 locations like Chipotle. Sure, McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) and Yum! Brands'(NYSE: YUM) Taco Bell are both much larger, but they've also been around for a lot longer than Chipotle. Chipotle, in fact, has only been a public company since 2006, when it held its initial public offering. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBy just about any measure, Chipotle is a standout in the restaurant sector today. And the chain continues to execute at a high level, with first-quarter sales rising a huge 14.1% and same-store sales, which looks at sales for locations open for at least a year, up a very impressive 7%. That speaks to a management team that is firing on all cylinders, operating its current fleet at a high level, which is captured in the same-store number, while also adding new locations that boost overall sales.\n\nThere's a reason why Chipotle's price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 60. While that's below the five-year average of around 70, it is still quite high on an absolute basis. Investors are paying up for a fairly large company that they expect to keep growing strongly.\n\nThat's entirely possible, but growth becomes more and more difficult to achieve the larger you get. It's a numbers game. Adding one restaurant when you own only one restaurant is a 100% increase in the store base. But the third location is only a 50% increase. The more restaurants you add, the slower the expansion rate becomes. Still, for more conservative investors looking to invest in growth stocks, Chipotle's proven success will be very compelling. Just go in knowing you are paying a big premium, noting that McDonald's P/E is only 22 and its five-year average P/E is 27.\n\nCava is all about the potential\n\nBy comparison, Cava is a tiny little restaurant chain with just 320 or so locations. But it opened 14 new sites in the first quarter of 2024. All told, the store base grew a huge 22% year over year! That's a number that would be almost unthinkable for Chipotle, which speaks to the opportunity ahead for Cava.\n\nStory continues\n\nCava is coming off of a very strong run. In 2023 its sales increased nearly 60% and its same-store sales rose by almost 18%. Those just aren't sustainable figures and they will probably make 2024 results look a bit less exciting because the company will be comparing against truly astounding growth figures. For example, first-quarter 2024 sales \"only\" rose 30% or so while same-store sales were up just 2.3%. Obviously, 30% sales growth is still very strong, but the 2.3% same-store figure is respectable for a fast-food company, though nowhere near as enticing as 18%.\n\nBut if Cava can keep expanding its store count and just maintain that low-single-digit same-store sales growth, it will still be a very fast-growing restaurant chain. And that, in a nutshell, is the investment thesis. There's one small problem, though. Cava is a very young company, having only held its IPO in mid-2023. Given that the P/E ratio is a massive 225, investors are clearly pricing in a lot of success in the years ahead (and probably looking at Chipotle to gauge its long-term potential). If the company lives up to expectations, it could be well worth the price and risk. If not, well, Wall Street is littered with restaurants that have crashed and burned.\n\nThe bottom line: There's more long-term growth opportunity with Cava than there is with Chipotle. But that opportunity is far from certain, which will make Cava most appropriate for aggressive growth investors.\n\nCava vs. Chipotle: Which one wins?\n\nThere are a few simple answers here and some more complex ones. For example, neither Chipotle nor Cava pay a dividend, so don't buy either if you are an income investor. And given the lofty P/E ratios, value investors may want to pass as well. But if you are a growth investor, you might find each of them of interest.\n\nThe difference is going to be whether you want to pay up in a big way for potential growth from a company with a short operating history or pay up in a more modest way for potential growth from a company with a solid track record of expanding over time. Or, to put it another way, most growth investors will probably find Chipotle more interesting while those looking to swing for the fences will likely be more attracted to Cava.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Restaurant companies' second-quarter 2024 results are likely to be bolstered by increased menu prices, higher average check sizes and expansion initiatives. Many restaurant companies benefited from partnerships with delivery services and digital platforms.\r\n\r\nRestaurant operators have been focused on digital innovation, sales-building strategies and cost-saving measures. Digital innovation has become crucial, with partnerships with delivery services like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats playing a significant role in boosting sales. The introduction of self-service kiosks and loyalty programs bodes well.\r\n\r\nThe industry players are likely to have benefited from the rise in off-premise sales, including delivery, takeout, drive-thru, catering, meal kits, and off-site options like kiosks and food trucks in the second quarter. Many operators also tested ghost or virtual kitchens, which have received positive customer feedback. The combination of off-premise offerings and connected curbside services has further driven customer satisfaction and industry growth.\r\n\r\nThe latest Earnings Trend report suggests that the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s second-quarter earnings are expected to increase 7.3% from the year-ago period\u2019s reported figure. The previous quarter recorded a 28.1% increase. The sector\u2019s revenues are projected to increase 4.4%, compared with 5% reported in the previous quarter. However, margins are expected to increase 0.2%. Companies from the restaurant industry, like BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Wingstop Inc. WING and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG are expected to beat estimates in the ongoing reporting cycle.\r\n\r\nHowever, high costs are likely to have negatively impacted the companies margin to some extent in second-quarter 2024. Intense competition, high wages and food cost inflation are concerning. The industry continues to bear increased expenses, which have been affecting margins. Higher pre-opening costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives have been exerting pressure on the company\u2019s margins.\n\nHow to Make the Right Pick?\n\nGiven the wide range of companies in this space, the task is by no means easy. While it is impossible to be sure of the outperformers, our proprietary methodology \u2014 a positive Earnings ESP along with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) \u2014 makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks with high chances of delivering a surprise in their upcoming earnings announcements. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the abovementioned combination, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nHere we discuss in detail the three abovementioned restaurant companies that are likely to beat estimates this time around.\r\n\r\nBJ's Restaurants is scheduled to report second-quarter 2024 results on Jul 25.

        "title": "Should You Think About Buying Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Now?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$68.55 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$53.38. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Chipotle Mexican Grill's current trading price of US$53.38 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nWhat Is Chipotle Mexican Grill Worth?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill appears to be overvalued by 37% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$53.38 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $38.91. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Chipotle Mexican Grill generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Chipotle Mexican Grill. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in CMG\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe CMG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CMG for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for CMG, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into Chipotle Mexican Grill, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

        "content": "Despite the current rotation into value and small-cap securities, there\u2019s still a place for growth stocks. After all, these have traditionally been the best-performing stocks over the long run. Driven by strong earnings, rapid expansion and swelling market share, the companies behind growth stocks tend to dominate the markets in which they compete.\n\nGrowth stocks remain the best option for long-term investors looking to expand their portfolios. While market cycles come and go, growth stocks\u2019 underlying strength and fundamentals persist and propel them to new heights. In the long run, shareholders benefit from holding growth stocks.\n\nHere are three growth stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK), the company behind Hoka sneakers and Ugg boots, has been a perennial top performer. The stock is up 65% over the last 12 months, including a 34% gain this year. With the share price hovering around $900, Deckers has announced a six-for-one stock split. DECK stock is expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on September 9, following approval by shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting.\n\nIf approved, this will be Deckers Outdoor\u2019s second stock split. The company previously split its stock on a three-for-one basis back in 2010. The latest stock split will lower the share price to about $150 based on where it\u2019s currently trading. DECK stock has gained 418% over the last five years due to strong sales of its footwear products, which also include Teva sandals. Deckers Outdoor is a growth stock worthy of consideration.\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nMediterranean restaurant chain Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) has been a runaway success since its initial public offering (IPO) a year ago. CAVA stock has risen 113% over the last 12 months. Analysts and investors love the company\u2019s rapid growth and its profitability, which is not the case for most new public concerns. The success to date has many analysts referring to Cava as the next Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).\n\nCava\u2019s most recent financial results were certainly encouraging, with the company beating Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines and raising its forward guidance. Cava reported first-quarter EPS of 13 cents, more than double the five cents expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $259 million, ahead of Wall Street expectations for $246 million. Sales were up 30% from a year earlier. Cava opened 14 new restaurant locations during the quarter, bringing its count across the U.S. to 323 outlets.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement raised its forward guidance, saying it expects to add 50 to 54 new restaurant locations in 2024, up from a previous forecast of 48 to 52 outlets. Cava also expects same-store sales to grow between 4.5% and 6.5% this year, from an earlier forecast of 3% to 5% growth. This is a company that\u2019s firing on all cylinders.\n\nCorning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the technology sector, we have specialty glassmaker Corning (NYSE:GLW). The company\u2019s shares have been on fire ever since it raised its forward guidance ahead of its second-quarter earnings report, which is scheduled for July 30. Specifically, Corning said that it expects revenue of $3.6 billion, compared with previous guidance that had called for $3.4 billion in Q2 sales. In terms of profit, Corning is now forecasting EPS at the \u201chigh end\u201d range of 42 cents to 46 cents.\n\nCorning stock has increased 18% since lifting its Q2 outlook, bringing its gain on the year to 50%. Investors have been piling into the stock after management said they are seeing increased sales as demand rises for its optical connectivity products for artificial intelligence (AI). Corning has sold off its consumer product line, including its cookware division, and now focuses exclusively on specialty glass used in optics for technological and scientific applications.\n\nGLW stock pays a quarterly dividend of 28 cents a share, giving it a yield of 2.44%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in DECK and CAVA.

        "content": "While thousands of companies will report second quarter earnings in the next few weeks, there are a handful of companies that are \u201cmust-see\u201d earnings reports. These are some of the best known, and most popular, companies.\n\nAll eyes will be on these five for a variety of reasons. Several are part of the Magnificent 7. Many investors own those 7 large cap stocks. But several others are simply popular growth stocks that have hit new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nQ2\u2019s Must-See Earnings Reports\n\nWhat will they say about the US, and global, economies? Is the recession here or will the Fed achieve a soft landing?\n\nSeveral companies are booming thanks to the AI revolution. Will AI still be a driver of earnings and sales in Q2?\n\nWhile there are a lot of companies that people will be tuning into during this earnings season, these 5 are the most important of all. You won\u2019t want to miss them.\n\nThe 5 Most Important Stocks to Watch During Q2 Earnings Season\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surprised on earnings 5 quarters in a row. In fact, it has a great earnings surprise track record with just 1 miss in the last 5 years and that was in early 2023.\n\nApple shares are up 19% year-to-date and are hitting all-time highs. Yet Apple trades at 35x forward earnings. Is Apple too hot to handle?\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) has beat 4 quarters in a row. That is a turnaround from a string of misses in 2021 and 2022.\n\nEli Lilly has been one of the hottest stocks on the Street. It is up 55.4% year-to-date. Eli Lilly is trading with a high valuation, as it has a forward P/E of 70. Will Eli Lilly continue to execute?\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) has beat 5 quarters in a row. It also has a solid 5-year earnings surprise track record, with just 3 misses during that time. That is impressive given the pandemic.\n\nShares of Chipotle are up 21% year-to-date and hit new all-time highs. However, Chipotle isn\u2019t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 51. Can Chipotle continue with the 20%+ earnings growth this quarter?\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has a great earnings surprise record. Microsoft has beat 7 quarters in a row. It has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2022.\n\nMicrosoft shares hit new all-time highs in 2024. It is up 18% year-to-date. Microsoft isn\u2019t cheap, however. It trades at 34x forward earnings. Will AI prove to be another catalyst for Microsoft in Q2?\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) has an excellent earnings surprise track record. It\u2019s beat 4 quarters in a row. Super Micro Computer has only missed once since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer have been red-hot in 2024, gaining 187% year-to-date on the AI trade. It reports earnings in Aug 2024. Super Micro is trading at 26x. Is Super Micro Computer a good bellwether of what\u2019s to come with the other AI stocks this earnings season?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis restaurant chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $350.32 million, up 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for BJ's Restaurants?\n\nFor BJ's Restaurants, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +9.25%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that BJ's Restaurants will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that BJ's Restaurants would post earnings of $0.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.32, delivering a surprise of +113.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nBJ's Restaurants appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.31 per share for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +24%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.93 billion, up 16.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Chipotle has been revised 0.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.72%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Chipotle will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Under Brian Niccol, its CEO since 2018, it has accelerated its growth, improved operations and efficiency, and set its sights on higher goals in bringing its casual healthy Mexican cuisine to all of North America and increasingly, the world.\n\nWe first bought the stock in client portfolios in March 2020 on the thesis that there was substantial growth runway and margin leverage in the business as it scaled. The initial reaction of the COVID pandemic shutdowns on the stock was severe, with a nearly 50% drawdown, which provided the opportunity to start buying at prices that we believed offered good future returns.

        "title": "After Chipotle's Stock Split, Should You Buy Before July 24?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) finally executed its much-anticipated 50-for-1 stock split last month. The fast-casual pioneer saw its stock price rise to well over $3,000 before the split, ultimately deciding that reducing the stock price was necessary.\n\nChipotle joins a growing list of companies deciding to split, and splits have become popular again after years of falling out of favor. Why?\n\nThere are a few factors that go into a decision like this (including some involving how stock options are awarded to employees and how they exercise those options). I think the rise of the retail trader probably has some influence in the decision. Retail traders have become a substantial part of the market that companies can't ignore. A record was set back in February when the average retail volume per day hit $1.5 billion. A split allows for more access to a wider range of this growing segment.\n\nWith the split executed, what's next for Chipotle? Investors are looking to the company's next earnings report, eagerly awaiting numbers for Q2. Let's take a look at what to pay attention to before their release on July 24.\n\nLook beyond revenue to comparable sales\n\nThe burrito maker's strong revenue growth is impressive, no doubt. Sure, it's not as mind-blowing as some tech stocks can deliver, but double-digit growth sustained over years in the quick service restaurant (QSR) industry isn't easy to achieve. Look at the chart showing Chipotle's compared to McDonald's over the past three years. MCD Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAnd it's been able to deliver this while becoming more efficient, raising its margins significantly each year. MCD Profit Margin Chart\n\nBut the number I'm most interested in is its comparable sales growth. This is the growth in sales within a single store year after year, instead of the entire company's bottom line.\n\nWhy is this different? Chipotle is opening stores left and right, driving new revenue growth from an increase in physical locations. Could consumers be turned off by Chipotle's premium price tag? That would more readily show itself in poor comparable sales while remaining masked in overall revenue growth.\n\nQ1 revealed 7% comparable sales growth year over year. This is respectable and in line with past quarters. A sharp drop held over multiple quarters could spell trouble for the company, however, so pay attention to the upcoming report.\n\nRestaurant openings keep marching on, and it looks like the company will too\n\nIn looking at comparable sales, I don't mean to imply that top-line revenue growth isn't important or that opening locations isn't a perfectly legitimate way to grow your business -- far from it. It's the primary way for many businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle is opening stores rapidly, with 47 additions last quarter, and has plans to continue at this rate for some time. I think Chipotle still has a long way to grow through location expansion before it reaches saturation, even here in North America, where most of its stores are located. There is a massive untapped global market waiting for it after North America sees its fill. That's a lot of opportunity for revenue growth.\n\nIn addition to opening new stores, the company has been innovating store design. Most new restaurants include a \"Chipotlane\" now. In fact, 45 of the 47 it opened last quarter included one.\n\nIntroduced in 2018, this is a simple but effective upgrade that moves all digital order pickups outside through a drive-thru window. Whether through Chipotle's own or a third-party app like DoorDash, mobile orders are a major way consumers purchase fast food now. By separating pickups from in-store orders, the location is more efficient and can serve more customers.\n\nChipotle is trading at quite a premium compared to others in its industry. It's in the realm of growth tech stocks. This does make me pause, but ultimately, I think the company can continue growing revenue by double digits well into the future. Therefore, it's mostly justified.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high of 40,720.64 on July 15. Despite the new record, the 30 blue-chip stocks that make up the index are only up 8% in 2024, less than half the S&P 500.\n\nGone are the days when investors considered these 30 Dow stocks the best investments you could own for the long haul. Technology certainly has had something to do with the changing of the guard. The same could be said for consumer discretionary stocks.\n\nToday\u2019s blue chips are not necessarily the Dow 30. They\u2019re stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with growth potential for years, if not decades, to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, if you buy blue-chip stocks in July, it should be one of these three alternatives to Dow 30 stocks. Each operates in the same sector as the three Dow 30 stocks, with better prospective returns over the long haul.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market\u2019s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinviz.com considers Costco (NASDAQ:COST) part of the consumer defensive sector. Others would say \u201cconsumer staples.\u201d That\u2019s neither here nor there. It is my blue-chip stock to buy as an alternative to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nJames Quincey became the CEO of Coca-Cola in January 2017 after 11 years at the company. In the past 7.5 years, he\u2019s been the beverage company\u2019s top leader, and its shares have appreciated by 54%. COST stock returned 427% in the same period, nearly eight times Coca-Cola\u2019s performance.\n\nI\u2019m a long-time Costco shopper. Its recent announcement that it would raise the annual membership fee Sept. 1 to $65 for its individual Gold Star and business members in the U.S. and Canada. Its premium memberships in the U.S. and Canada will rise to $130.\n\nThe stock fell on the news.\n\nHowever, considering it hasn\u2019t raised the membership fee since 2017 and is about two years past the five-year historical average, I\u2019m not sure how members or investors can be negative about the action taken.\n\nCostco has always been about providing consumers with the lowest prices possible, generating most of its profits from membership fees. Compared to beverage companies Coke and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), which have gone hog wild on price increases over the past two years, Costco has held its prices steady.\n\nIt\u2019s a much better blue-chip stock.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J.

Others would say \u201cconsumer discretionary.\u201d It is one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy as an alternative to McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD).\n\nFirst, if you want to own a restaurant stock, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NASDAQ:CMG) would be a better choice given its pricing power, but I digress.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn May, the company reported Q1 2024 results that included earnings per share of 93 cents, 22.4% higher than a year ago and five cents better than analyst expectations. Revenue increased by 5.9% year-over-year to $12.48 billion. However, some investors focused on the 3.0% same-store sales growth in the quarter, 70 basis points less than the Wall Street consensus.\n\nFor the second quarter, it sees an EPS of 89 cents at the midpoint of guidance, five cents shy of analyst expectations. One analyst, Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe, sees this as a case of \u201cunderpromise and overdeliver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe guidance remains conservative, and continue to see a favorable buying environment for [TJX\u2019s stock],\u201d MarketWatch reported Tarlowe\u2019s comments to clients.\n\nAs McDonald\u2019s prices have risen, the restaurant chain has struggled to keep low-income customers buying its products. TJX is the better blue-chip stock to buy.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) is part of the communication services sector. I\u2019m making a controversial call by selecting it as a better blue-chip stock to buy than Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS).\n\nThat\u2019s especially true since the social media platform\u2019s stock struggled in the past month, down over 7%. However, over the past five years, despite underperforming relative to the index, PINS stock gained 59%, 89 percentage points better than Disney.\n\nFurther, with the country divided, it\u2019s about the only social media platform whose user interactions aren\u2019t completely unhealthy and uncalled for. It\u2019s very good for the future. Here\u2019s why.\n\nIn Q1 2024, its earnings jumped 150%. FactSet estimates suggest that they\u2019ll rise 32% YOY in Q2, 23% in Q3 and 19% for Q4, with revenue growth over this period of 19.5% per quarter.\n\n\u201c\u2018Thanks to our investments in AI (artificial intelligence) and shopability, we\u2019re driving even greater returns for advertisers and gaining access to performance budgets,\u2019 said Bill Ready, Pinterest CEO, in its earnings recent report. The company generates revenue from online ads,\u201d Investor\u2019s Business Daily reported.\n\nI might be an outlier, but I believe its stock will outperform Disney over the next five years like it did the past five. That makes it a top blue-chip stock to buy in July.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Making Dollars and Sense of Chipotle's New Price Targets",
        "content": "A stock split doesn't just adjust a publicly traded company's price and how many shares its investors own. Analysts also need to revise their profit targets to keep up with the new math.\n\nIt's been three weeks since Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) executed its 50-for-1 stock split. The seamless transaction replaced every single share at the old price with 50 new shares at 2% of the former price. It's a zero-sum game, but many analysts didn't make the same tweak on their end.\n\nA splitting headache\n\nJeffrey Bernstein at Barclays became the latest Wall Street pro to update his price goal after the split. His note on Wednesday morning replaces the earlier target of $2,865 with $58. If this was an actual 50-for-1 revision, the new price would've been $57.30. It's natural to avoid going right of the decimal, but it's telling that Bernstein chose to round up to $58 instead of taking the shorter path down to $57.\n\nThe analyst isn't bullish on the chain. He's sticking to his neutral equal weight rating on the shares. His new target is roughly a quarter from where the shares closed on Tuesday. He sees store-level comps easing across the restaurant industry.\n\nMany quick-service concepts are responding to the potential economic softening by taking advantage of easing inflation to introduce value-priced offerings. Chipotle isn't tossing its hat into this ring, but traditional fast-food chains going this route could disrupt the value proposition that the \"food with integrity\" chain of 3,479 eateries offers to consumers. Bulls can at least take heart in noting that Bernstein rounded up instead of down following the split. Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill.\n\nRolling along like a burrito\n\nBernstein at Barclays isn't the only one who waited weeks after the split to update a firm's position. Earlier this week, the market saw Brian Mullan at Piper Sandler go the other way. He's recalibrating what would've been a $61.40 target down to $61 on the split adjustment. He sees comps rising roughly 10% for Chipotle for the second quarter that the chain will report next week, ahead of the analyst consensus. However, he's taking a cautious stance on industry concerns about how recent trends could weigh on sales in the new quarter.\n\nEvercore ISI was the other major firm to update its target. It went for a more precise slice, going from $3,600 to $72 for a perfect 50-for-1 execution. At least Evercore is bullish. The split-adjusted price implies 25% of upside for the shares from current levels.\n\nThe revisions were more encouraging late last week. Analysts at Citi and Stephens boosted their price targets by 5% on Friday. Is favorable sentiment stabilizing this quickly?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe wave of updates a couple of weeks after the split itself isn't surprising. The split itself didn't require a rush to put out new research notes. With Chipotle eyeing a telltale financial update in the middle of next week, it makes sense to draw lines in the sand now. This will be an important report for the fast-growing chain that put \"fast casual\" on the map. The second quarter itself should be solid, but the market will be hanging on what Chipotle offers in terms of how recent trends are affecting the chain heading into the second half of this year.\n\nThree months ago, Chipotle was looking for comps to climb in the mid- to high-single-digit range for all of 2024. Plans to expand by another 285 to 315 new units this year would push performance to another year of double-digit growth on the top line. Keep an eye out next week to see if any of this changes in its outlook.\n\nAnalysts earlier this year were expecting earnings to outpace revenue growth for the fourth year in a row, but that's not a given if price wars continue to break out on the low end of the restaurant stock landscape. Draw a circle around July 24 on your calendar if you're a Chipotle investor. Things are heating up in the kitchen, and volatility will be on the menu by the time the market opens on Thursday of next week.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis Mexican food chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +24%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.93 billion, up 16.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.91% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chipotle?\n\nFor Chipotle, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.60%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Chipotle will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Chipotle would post earnings of $0.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.27, delivering a surprise of +17.39%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nChipotle appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Premier Stock-Split Stocks I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole in the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "Although the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has captivated Wall Street, don't overlook just how much of a catalyst companies enacting stock splits have been since the year began.\n\nA stock split provides a path for a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count. Splits are superficial in the sense that they have no effect on a company's market cap or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock splits come in two forms, forward and reverse, with investors undeniably favoring the former. With a forward-stock split, a public company is angling to make its shares more nominally affordable for retail investors. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is designed to increase a company's share price, which is usually done to ensure it meets the minimum listing standards of a major stock exchange. Since reverse splits are usually enacted in a position of weakness, investors typically flock to companies conducting forward-stock splits.\n\nSince 2024 began, around a dozen high-profile, time-tested businesses have announced and/or completed respective stock splits. While many of these stock-split stocks are well-positioned to deliver for their long-term shareholders, this isn't the case across the board.\n\nA combination of mounting headwinds and otherworldly valuation make the following three premier stock-split stocks wholly avoidable in the second half of 2024.\n\nNvidia\n\nThe first stock-split stock that I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole for the remainder of the year, and perhaps well beyond, is the hardware kingpin of the AI revolution, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia's board announced a 10-for-1 forward split on May 22, which went into effect following the close of businesses on June 7.\n\nDespite being no fan of Nvidia's stock at its current valuation, I'll absolutely give credit where credit is due. The company's operating ramp has been virtually textbook and will likely be discussed in classrooms and on Wall Street for decades to come.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) also have a practical monopoly in AI-accelerated data centers. The analysts at TechInsights pegged Nvidia's share of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped in 2023 at (drumroll)... 98%!\n\nThe problems I have with Nvidia boil down to history, competition, and valuation.\n\nWith regard to the former, there hasn't been a game-changing innovation, technology, or trend for three decades that didn't endure an early innings bubble. While predicting when the euphoria will end is impossible, history is undefeated when it comes to investors overestimating the adoption and utility of new innovations.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecondly, Nvidia is contending with its first real bouts of AI-data center competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Further, its four biggest customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs for use in their data centers. Even if Nvidia's hardware remains superior to its competition, the presence of these externally and internally developed chips all but ensures less space in enterprise data centers for Nvidia's GPUs. It also likely marks an end to Nvidia's otherworldly pricing power for its AI-GPUs.\n\nLastly, Nvidia's trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is the stuff horror movies are made of. As of the closing bell on July 12, Nvidia was valued at 40 times TTM P/S, which is more or less in line with the peak TTM P/S ratios for Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Though it's impossible to pinpoint when a bubble will burst, all signs continue to point to Nvidia's stock being in one. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nA second high-flying stock-split stock that I'd suggest avoiding like the plague for the second half of 2024 is AI-driven enterprise analytics software company MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR). MicroStrategy's board declared a 10-for-1 forward split on July 11, with an effective date of August 7, following the close of trading.\n\nWhile MicroStrategy has had a software division for decades, it's best-known as the company that holds the most Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), the world largest cryptocurrency by market value. A June 20 update from the company showed that it held 226,331 Bitcoin, or 11,931 more tokens than it previously held as of the end of April. This represents more than 1% of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be mined.\n\nWhile investors -- and MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor -- are clearly excited about Bitcoin's future, there are some key reasons why this stock-split stock is worth avoiding.\n\nTo begin with, Bitcoin has lost the first-mover luster that once made it desirable. It's nowhere close to being the fastest or cheapest way to make digital payments; nor is it particularly scarce, with lines of computer code and community consensus being the only things standing in the way of a higher token count.\n\nBitcoin's real-world use case is lacking, too. Despite the repeated efforts of El Salvador's government to encourage the use of Bitcoin as legal tender, 88% of residents didn't use it as a form of payment in 2023.\n\nBut the biggest issue with MicroStrategy might just be the premium investors have attached to its stock. As of this writing on July 12, Bitcoin was trading at $57,853 per token. This works out to about $13.1 billion in market value for MicroStrategy's Bitcoin assets. However, investors have placed in the neighborhood of a $10 billion premium on the company's assets. Put another way, instead of buying Bitcoin for $57,853 per token on a crypto exchange, investors in MicroStrategy are paying close to $100,000 per Bitcoin, based on its assets.\n\nThe nail in the coffin is that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings have been financed by multiple convertible-debt offerings. If Bitcoin enters another steep bear market, there are no assurances the company will be able to meet its hefty debt obligations.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe third premier stock-split stock I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pile in the second half of 2024 is high-flying fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board approved a historic 50-for-1 stock split on March 19, which went into effect after the close of trading on June 25.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, I'm not oblivious to the variety of ways Chipotle has out-innovated and out-executed its competition. Chipotle's promise to use responsibly raised meats and (when possible) locally sourced vegetables has led to a loyal customer base that's willing to pay a premium price for its food.\n\nFurthermore, Chipotle's addition of mobile order drive-thru lanes, known as \"Chipotlanes,\" has been a game-changer. These digital order lanes, coupled with the company purposely keeping its menu small, have improved internal operating efficiency in its restaurants.\n\nThe concerns I have with Chipotle primarily revolve around its valuation.\n\nAlthough I just talked up how the company's Chipotlanes have lifted its organic growth prospects, there's only so much innovation that can be expected from restaurant chains. While sales jumped 14.1% for the company during the first quarter, roughly half of this gain was the result of opening new restaurants.\n\nDigging into the proverbial burrito reveals comparable-restaurant sales growth of \"only\" 7%, of which 1.6% was the result of an increase in average check size. Though pricing power is an important aspect of any solid business, inflationary price hikes aren't worth a significant premium. As of the closing bell on July 12, investors were paying 43 times forward-year earnings for this 7% organic growth rate.\n\nTo add to this point, the stock market as a whole is at one of its priciest valuations when looking back more than a century. The S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings ratio is north of 36, which has historically been a signal that a bear market is coming. When the next sizable stock market correction does arrive, companies with premium valuations, like Chipotle, MicroStrategy, and Nvidia, are liable to be hit the hardest.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investors interested in stocks from the Retail - Restaurants sector have probably already heard of BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nRight now, BJ's Restaurants is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Chipotle Mexican Grill has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that BJRI has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nBJRI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 26.88, while CMG has a forward P/E of 51.13. We also note that BJRI has a PEG ratio of 1.92. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. CMG currently has a PEG ratio of 2.25.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for BJRI is its P/B ratio of 2.28. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CMG has a P/B of 23.13.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to BJRI's Value grade of B and CMG's Value grade of F.\n\nBJRI stands above CMG thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that BJRI is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The S&P 500 is the hallmark of portfolio diversification. When most investors aim to \u201cbeat the market,\u201d they are talking about this index. It contains 500 profitable publicly traded corporations, with allocations weighted by market cap. For instance, investors will have the most exposure to the largest publicly traded corporation and the least exposure to the 500th largest company on the list.\n\nThis index routinely adds and removes stocks based on financial performance and other factors. Furthermore, it\u2019s not easy to get into the S&P 500. A company must fulfill several requirements, such as having a sufficient market cap and reporting a profitable year.\n\nAlthough many investors use index investing to match the market, it\u2019s possible to outperform the S&P 500. These growth stocks have lived up to the premise and have outpaced the S&P 500 so far. Investors may want to take a closer look at these growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a haven for consumers who want to protect their wallets and buy affordable products. The company can deliver solid earnings during the good times and remain resilient during economic downturns. Walmart has delivered a 30% year-to-date gain, which outpaces the S&P 500\u2019s 18% year-to-date gain.\n\nWalmart also offers a 1.20% yield for its investors. While dividend growth has been an issue in previous years, the company recently announced a 9% dividend hike \u2014 the highest dividend increase in more than a decade.\n\nQ1 FY25 financial results suggest that Walmart can continue the rally. Revenue increased by 6.0% year-over-year in that quarter, while adjusted EPS was up by 22.4% year-over-year. Global e-commerce sales were a major highlight, increasing by 21% year-over-year. Store-fulfilled pickups and deliveries continue to pick up momentum. Investors should also monitor the small but growing advertising segment, which reported 24% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about outperforming the S&P 500 without mentioning at least one of the Magnificent Seven stocks. These stocks have carried the index to new heights for several years and heavily influence the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks, delivering a 30% year-to-date return. Online marketplace sales continue to grow and achieve double-digit revenue growth in domestic and international markets. That wasn\u2019t the only highlight from Q1 2024 results. While overall revenue increased by 13% year-over-year, the company also reported 17% revenue growth for Amazon Web Services. That part of Amazon\u2019s business generated $25.0 billion in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile e-commerce and cloud computing are Amazon\u2019s core specialties, the company is making strides in the advertising market. The tech giant reported $11.8 billion in ad revenue this quarter, a 24% year-over-year increase. Amazon thrives in multiple industries, which should lead to long-term gains for patient investors.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Graphic of yellow money bag next to green arrow and coins floating in air, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Monster Ztudio\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is a Brazilian digital bank that offers a wide range of financial products and services to the Latin American community. Shares have logged a 65% year-to-date return. It helps that the company recently surpassed 100 million users, most of whom are active.\n\nThe digital bank reported an 83% activity rate at the end of the first quarter. This rate demonstrates that 83% of the company\u2019s 100 million customers are active monthly. The bank has more than 83 million monthly active users, and they use multiple financial products. Nu Holdings reported 69% year-over-year revenue growth as customers used the bank\u2019s personal loans, credit cards, bank accounts, brokerage accounts and other resources.\n\nWall Street analysts still believe that the stock can rise. Seven analysts rate it a Strong Buy, with a projected 5% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $15.20 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 13%.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been outperforming the stock market for several years. It has almost quadrupled over the past five years and is up 28% year-to-date. The Mexican Grill chain recently completed a 50-for-1 stock split and has been under a correction ever since. This correction presents an opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nThe company continues to grow at a robust pace. Revenue increased by 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion in the first quarter, and net income rose by 23.2% year-over-year to reach $259.3 million. Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants this quarter and remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants throughout the year.\n\nRestaurant expansion isn\u2019t the only reason Chipotle\u2019s revenue is still rising. The company reported 7.0% year-over-year growth in comparable restaurant sales. Wall Street analysts are on board and have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The average price target suggests a 16% upside, while the highest price target of $80 per share indicates that a 38% gain is possible.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another member of the Magnificent Seven that has outperformed the S&P 500 over a lengthy amount of time, including this year. Facebook\u2019s parent company has logged a 44% year-to-date gain and comes with a 0.40% yield. The stock trades at a 29 P/E ratio and trades at a $1.26 trillion valuation.\n\nThe social media giant closed out the first quarter with 3.24 billion daily active users, 7% higher than the same time last year. Meta Platforms\u2019 large user base allows it to experiment with new products and AI offerings. As it works on new initiatives, the company performs well with its current business model. Revenue increased by 27% year over year, while net income surged by 117% year over year.\n\nMeta Platforms remain a big hit on Wall Street. The stock is rated a Strong Buy with a projected 6% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $625 per share suggests the company can rally by an additional 25%.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) isn\u2019t as big as Chipotle, but the steakhouse chain has momentum and a more reasonable valuation. The stock trades at a 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.44% yield. Shares are up by 42% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nThe steakhouse chain reported 12.5% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. Net income jumped by 31.9% year-over-year, which should help the company maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate. Texas Roadhouse opened 12 restaurants in the quarter, including three franchises. The steakhouse chain\u2019s comparable sales increased by 8.4% year-over-year at company-owned restaurants. The growth rate came in at 7.7% for franchise restaurants. Both growth rates are respectable and demonstrate that Texas Roadhouse is becoming a fixture in numerous communities.\n\nWall Street analysts have rated the stock as a Moderate Buy. The average price target only implies a 3% upside, but the highest price target of $191 per share suggests a potential 13% gain.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

The cybersecurity firm is a recent addition to the S&P 500, delivering a 50% year-to-date gain.

Cybersecurity is projected to maintain a compounded annual growth rate of 13.8% until 2030. Many companies will benefit from the industry\u2019s success, but few are as well-positioned as Crowdstrike.\n\nWhile other cybersecurity companies have reported decelerating revenue growth, Crowdstrike continues to charge ahead. The company reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Crowdstrike operates on a subscription business model and currently has $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue.

The restaurant chain\u2019s shares jumped more than 38% last year and are up 26% year-to-date (YTD).

The move effectively renders the stock more accessible and appealing to retail investors, proving to be a great decision overall.\n\nOn the financial front, Chipotle continues to deliver goods to its shareholders. It reported a healthy 14.1% year-over-year (YOY) revenue increase and a 23.2% jump in net income for Q1. Moreover, the firm also launched 47 new locations, staying on track to open 285-315 restaurants this year. Furthermore, comparable restaurant sales grew by 7% on a YOY basis, highlighting Chipotle\u2019s enduring appeal.\n\nHilton Worldwide (HLT) the sign in front of a Hilton (HLT) hotel\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT) is a bellwether in the hotel industry, efficiently blending comfort with upscale locations to cater to its massive customer base. Like CMG, HLT stock remains a cornerstone in Ackman\u2019s portfolio, accounting for 26.9% of Pershing\u2019s portfolio. Additionally, HLT stock surged over 45% last year, underscoring the robust investor confidence in its stock.\n\nFurthermore, Hilton has consistently posted double-digit top-line growth across multiple quarters post-pandemic. The latest chapter in its ongoing growth saga is shown in its impressive Q1 results, where it blew past analyst earnings expectations while boosting its full-year outlook. Revenue surged 12.2% YOY to $2.57 billion, while its EPS climbed to $1.53, beating estimates by 11 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese superb results are linked to Hilton\u2019s adept management, which has fine-tuned its operations to adapt to evolving market trends. Moreover, its robust business model and ability to attract and retain guests underscores its leadership position in its niche.\n\nCanadian Pacific Kansas City (CP) A photo of train tracks leading toward a sunset.\n\nSource: Liz Kcer/ShutterStock.com\n\nCanadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE:CP) is a stalwart in the railroad industry, which makes up approximately 16.7% of Ackman\u2019s portfolio. Rail transport remains one of the most cost-effective methods for bulk transportation, and its extensive railway infrastructure is tough to replicate due to multiple barriers to entry.\n\nFurthermore, CP boasts an impressive economic moat, solidifying its position as a leading contender in the North American region. It struts an expansive network spanning roughly 20,000 route miles across Canada and the United States, fortifying its enviable positioning.\n\nRecently, the company has capitalized on the nearshoring trend as businesses strategically bolster their supply chains closer to their operations. This strategic shift has led to significant contract wins for CP, leading to double-digit revenue growth in recent quarters.\u00a0 Moreover, this superb trajectory underscores the company\u2019s critical role in redefining supply chain dynamics with significant potential for sustained long-term growth.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Retail - Restaurants stocks have likely encountered both Compass Group PLC (CMPGY) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Compass Group PLC has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Chipotle Mexican Grill has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that CMPGY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nCMPGY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 24.03, while CMG has a forward P/E of 52.08. We also note that CMPGY has a PEG ratio of 1.96. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CMG currently has a PEG ratio of 2.30.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for CMPGY is its P/B ratio of 7.75. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CMG has a P/B of 23.56.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to CMPGY's Value grade of B and CMG's Value grade of F.\n\nCMPGY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than CMG, so it seems like value investors will conclude that CMPGY is the superior option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 High-Priced Stocks Ripe for a Split and Surge",
        "content": "Stock splits are all the rage this year. In the last month alone, there\u2019s been a 10-for-1 stock split by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and a 50-for-1 split by Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), one of the biggest events in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier this year, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) split its stock 3-for-1. And chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) executed a 1o-for-1 split on July 15.\n\nWhile it is true that stock splits don\u2019t change the underlying fundamentals or valuation of a stock, they do make the shares more affordable, especially to retail investors. Broadcom\u2019s stock traded on July 12 at $1,700 a share. Now it\u2019s priced at $170. The lower price helps to explain why most stocks get a boost immediately after their shares split. Companies realize this, which is why they continue to split their stocks.\n\nHere are three high-priced stocks ripe for a split and surge.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) In this photo illustration, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) Incorporated logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) announced a 10-for-1 stock split on July 11. Sure enough, the company\u2019s share price surged, up 7% on the news. The company, which is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in the world, said the shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis August 8. The split comes as MicroStrategy\u2019s stock has risen more than 230% over the last 12 months to trade at $1,500 per share.\n\nOnce completed, the split will lower MicroStrategy\u2019s share price to about $150 a share based on the current price. While technically a provider of enterprise software, MicroStrategy has switched its focus in recent years and adopted an aggressive Bitcoin-buying strategy. At the end of June this year, MicroStrategy owned 226,331 Bitcoin worth $13.30 billion based on the current price of the largest cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nAnalysts at Bernstein recently wrote in a note to clients that MicroStrategy is \u201cbuilding the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin company\u201d and that the stock has an additional 80% upside.\n\nFair Isaac Corp. (FICO) a pile of credit cards, credit card interest rates\n\nSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.com\n\nFair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO), the credit scoring agency behind everyone\u2019s FICO score, looks like a good candidate for a stock split with its share price currently at $1,550 and trading near a 52-week high. The company\u2019s share price has nearly doubled in the last year, including a 37% year-to-date gain. At more than $1,500 each, the shares are out of reach for many retail investors who might like to get their hands on them.\n\nFair Isaac has previously split its stock on four occasions. However, the last split occurred 20 years ago. Given the length of time since the last split, now would seem like a good time for Fair Isaac to make its stock more accessible to individual investors. The company\u2019s share price has marched steadily higher on the back of strong financial results. Fair Isaac enjoys a near-monopoly over credit scoring in the U.S. These facts have made Fair Isaac one of the best-performing stocks of the last 10 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVR (NVR) The logo for NVR is seen on the top of an office building.\n\nSource: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a company that has never split its stock, though it probably should. Home builder and mortgage bank NVR (NYSE:NVR) has been publicly traded since 1993, yet never split its stock. The result is that the company\u2019s shares now trade at $8,000 each, putting them far out of reach for most investors. A split of the company\u2019s stock would be a massive undertaking at this point, but would likely give the share price a boost.\n\nInterestingly, NVR stock has continued to rise despite the sticker shock involved with its share price. Over the last 12 months, the stock has gained nearly 30%, including a 15% gain this year. And the stock is currently trading at a reasonable price-earnings ratio of 16 times future earnings estimates. The stock\u2019s valuation is not out of whack despite the $8,000 price tag.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that NVR is one of the few stocks that Warren Buffett bought over the last year. Buffett, of course, is famous for having never split the Class A shares of his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) holding company. Those Class A shares of Berkshire now trade at an astounding $639,000 each.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA and FICO.

        "title": "How to Find Strong Retail-Wholesale Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises",
        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Home Depot (HD) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.61 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on August 13, 2024.\n\nHome Depot's Earnings ESP sits at 0.44%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.61 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.59.\n\nHD is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) as well.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 24, 2024. CMG's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.31 a share nine days from its next earnings release.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chipotle Mexican Grill is $0.31, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.33%.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, HD and CMG could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Chipotle Stock Alert: Why Investors Should Buy the Dip In CMG Shares",
        "content": "Investors should view the recent decline in Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) as an opportunity to buy Chipotle stock hand over fist. The stock has declined nearly 10% since the June 26 split.\n\nThe 50-for-1 stock split was the first ever for Chipotle and one of the largest such transactions in the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s history. This (almost certainly temporary) pullback only made the stock cheaper and more attractive, given the strong underlying fundamentals of the company.\n\nA Huge Split for Chipotle Stock\n\nChipotle\u2019s first ever stock split took the company\u2019s share price down from $3,210 to $64.20. The stock is now trading at $57.55 per share, having fallen 17% from a 52-week high reached right before the split happened.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the stock split hasn\u2019t changed the fundamentals or valuation of Chipotle\u2019s stock, it has made the shares more accessible to investors who previously couldn\u2019t afford them.\n\nPeople today can literally buy CMG stock at its lowest price since the company held its initial public offering back in 2006.\n\nShrewd investors should keep in mind that Chipotle has been a long-term winner for stockholders, posting gains that are better than many high-flying technology stocks.\n\nDespite the post-split drawdown, Chipotle stock is still up 40% over the last 12 months. In the past five years, the shares have gained 283%.\n\nContinued Growth\n\nChipotle stock has been propelled higher by a sterling record of earnings outperformance. Most recently, Chipotle posted better-than-expected financial results for this year\u2019s first quarter and raised its forward guidance.\n\nFor Q1, Chipotle reported EPS of $13.37 compared to $11.68 that was forecast on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $2.70 billion versus $2.68 billion that was the consensus expectation of analysts. Sales rose 14% from a year earlier.\n\nChipotle said that its same-store sales rose 7% in Q1, beating estimates of 5.2% growth. The restaurant chain added 47 new locations during the quarter, moving closer to its goal of doubling its total number of restaurants to 7,000 outlets.\n\nAs for guidance, Chipotle said it anticipates same-store sales growth in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage, up from its prior range of a mid-single-digit increase. The company also reiterated its forecast of 285 to 315 new store openings this year.\n\nChipotle is scheduled to report its second-quarter financial results on July 24.\n\nMinor Controversy\n\nDespite all its success, Chipotle has found itself embroiled in a minor controversy.\n\nA customer backlash has developed online over complaints that the company has shrunk its portion sizes at the same time that it has raised prices. Management has disputed claims that portions have decreased, though they have acknowledged raising prices to keep pace with inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle most recently raised prices across its entire network last October, citing persistent inflation and higher input costs. More recently, Chipotle raised prices in California by 7% in April of this year to offset the state\u2019s higher minimum wage for fast-food workers.\n\nWhile the controversy could be a factor in the recent slide of CMG stock, any impacts are likely to be short lived, especially as inflation continues to decline and interest rates move lower in coming months.\n\nSome analysts have also raised concerns about the valuation of Chipotle stock, noting that the shares trade at 60 times future earnings estimates. While high, the multiple on the stock is a reflection of the sustained growth at the company and demand for its shares.\n\nBuy Chipotle Stock\n\nChipotle looks like a good bet after its recent 50-for-1 stock split. The split and pullback in the share price have put CMG stock at its most affordable level in more than 10 years.\n\nThe company continues to grow at a strong and steady rate. There is every reason to believe that the growth trajectory can continue.\n\nComplaints about portion sizes and higher prices will fade in time and should not be a major long-term factor. For these reasons, Chipotle stock is a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE:CMG) earnings growth rate lags the 31% CAGR delivered to shareholders",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) shareholders have seen the share price descend 12% over the month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been very strong. In fact, the share price is 286% higher today. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. The more important question is whether the stock is too cheap or too expensive today.\n\nAlthough Chipotle Mexican Grill has shed US$7.0b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Chipotle Mexican Grill achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 45% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 31% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 61.09, the market remains optimistic.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Chipotle Mexican Grill's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Chipotle Mexican Grill shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 40% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 31%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified  1 warning sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill that you should be aware of.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find lesser know companies this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Chipotle Stock Is Up 26% so far in 2024. How High Can It Go in the Second Half?",
        "content": "Investors are consistently bullish on Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) stock, but it picked up some extra hype recently with its attention-grabbing 50-for-1 stock split on June 26.\n\nSince then, the hype has calmed down, and shares have pulled back from their year-to-date highs. But even so, Chipotle stock is up a market-beating 26% so far this year. Can it go even higher before the end of 2024?\n\nWhy Chipotle stock is surging\n\nThe stock-split hype certainly had a lot to do with Chipotle stock's popularity this year. Management first announced the transaction in mid-March, becoming another high-profile stock split for 2024. Shares gained 17% between the announcement and the split.\n\nStock splits can only happen with years of share-price growth and a bullish outlook, and there's a lot to be bullish about here. Chipotle is already the leader in the fast-casual dining category. Its fresh and healthy concept at an affordable price attracts a loyal crowd. It boasts strong, consistent comparable-sales growth at a time when many competing restaurant chains are struggling. It's also highly profitable with expanding margins despite rising food and labor expenses.\n\nThe company continues to expand at a rapid pace too; it's already opened 47 stores in the first quarter, and it plans to open about 300 total in 2024 (up from 271 last year). Management has set a long-term goal of expanding its store count from about 3,500 to over 7,000.\n\nIs Chipotle too expensive?\n\nA common concern from investors, however, is Chipotle's valuation. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 62 as of this writing. That's a premium valuation, but believe it or not, it's trading at a discount to its five-year average multiple of 76.\n\nChipotle commands a premium valuation because of its reliable track record, but it's still a high premium for a company reporting low double-digit revenue growth. Nvidia, by comparison, trades at a P/E ratio of 75 while reporting triple-digit growth.\n\nChipotle has fallen 12% since its stock split. Much of restaurant sector has retreated in reaction to analysts' calls for a slow summer season, but investors need to keep track of long-term developments, not short-term volatility. A great business will bounce back from temporary headwinds.\n\nEven trading below its historical average, Chipotle stock isn't a bargain, so the question is: Can Chipotle sustain this valuation?\n\nCurrent momentum suggests the stock can end the year with market-beating gains. But that's a short-term outlook. Looking further out, Chipotle has an ambitious expansion plan, and long-term investors will likely thank themselves for buying Chipotle stock today.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Cava vs. Chipotle: Which Is the Better Restaurant Stock?",
        "content": "Fast casual dining has become one of the most popular options for diners over the last several years.\n\nTwo leading fast casual restaurant chains are Mediterranean-inspired CAVA Group(NYSE: CAVA) and burrito specialist Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG).\n\nSo far in 2024, Cava stock is up 98% while shares of Chipotle have gained 25% -- each handily topping the S&P 500.\n\nLet's dive into the business results of Cava and Chipotle and assess which stock might be the better buy for long-term investors.\n\nAnalyzing Cava\n\nWhen analyzing restaurant businesses, metrics such as new store openings and same-store sales can be useful.\n\nDuring Cava's first fiscal quarter of 2024 (ended April 21), the company opened 14 net new restaurants. This represented 23% growth year over year, and brought Cava's total restaurant count to 323.\n\nThe company's revenue soared 30% year over year during Q1 to $256.3 million, while same-store sales rose by 2.3%.\n\nDespite a macroeconomic environment battling stubborn inflation, Cava has also showcased a commitment to strong unit economics. For the period ended April 21, Cava reported net income of $14 million, compared to a loss of $2.1 million last year.\n\nMoreover, the company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) essentially doubled year over year during Q1, while free cash flow swung to $4.7 million compared to cash burn of $13.4 million last year.\n\nAll things considered, Cava's financial profile is quite impressive. However, with the stock surging 98% so far in 2024, investors need to assess the company's valuation. CAVA PS Ratio Chart\n\nAs seen in the chart above, Cava's price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 11.7 is considerably above Chipotle's. In a way, this could make some sense. Chipotle is a much more mature business compared to Cava. However, the valuation disparity between the two restaurant stocks is hard to overlook.\n\nLet's dig into Chipotle's business and see whether Cava's premium valuation is deserved. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAnalyzing Chipotle\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, Chipotle reported revenue of $2.7 billion -- an increase of 14.1% year over year. While this level of revenue growth is only about half as much as Cava's during the first quarter, Chipotle is clearly a much larger business, considering that its revenue is more than 10-fold that of Cava's.\n\nWhere Chipotle really sets itself apart from the competition is same-store sales and profit margins.\n\nDuring Q1, Chipotle's comparable restaurant sales rose 7% -- more than triple Cava's sales. The company's restaurant level operating margin was 27.5%. In comparison, Cava's restaurant level profit margin was 25.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the end of Q1, Chipotle boasted nearly 3,500 locations -- roughly 10 times Cava's number. The company's average restaurant sales of $3.1 million were notably higher than Cava's $2.6 million.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe trends explored above suggest that Chipotle has superior unit economics to Cava. It's a much bigger company and outperforms Cava in just about every important financial and operating metric.\n\nMy suspicion is that a lot of capital has poured into Cava stock with the underlying thesis that the company might be the next Chipotle. While this has some merit, it is going to take many years to determine if Cava will eventually reach the size and scale of Chipotle.\n\nAll the while, Chipotle isn't exactly giving investors reasons to think its own growth could begin decelerating or plateauing. While money can be made owning both Cava and Chipotle stock, I see one clear winner here: Chipotle.\n\nI think Chipotle represents a best-in-class brand among restaurant stocks, and the company's impressive financial profile and key performance indications suggest that the growth narrative should stay intact for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle's Stock Split Is Complete. Here's What to Expect for the Rest of 2024.",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) has been an investor favorite for years, but it received special attention this year after announcing a 50-for-1 stock split. That's one of the biggest splits ever, and with the shares' four-figure price tag prior to the split, it made a lot of sense.\n\nIt went through in June, and Chipotle stock dropped slightly afterward. It trades at $57.50 per share as of this writing, but that's still a 26% gain year to date. What else can investors expect after the split?\n\nHigher sales\n\nChipotle reliably reports double-digit sales growth quarterly, and it's usually driven by new stores and growth in comparable-store sales (comps). Revenue increased 14% year over year in the 2024 first quarter with a 7% increase in comps. Management is guiding for similar results for the full year.\n\nIt has standard tactics that it usually employs to drive revenue at various times, including menu innovation and marketing campaigns for specific food items. It also regularly offers limited-time options and specials to generate interest and engagement.\n\nHigher profits\n\nExpenses as a percentage of sales decreased year over year in the first quarter, mostly as a result of price increases. The company has its finger on the pulse of what its customers like and what they're willing to pay for. Management has successfully raised prices to counter the impact of rising costs without curbing demand.\n\nThe Wall Street analyst consensus for full-year earnings per share (EPS) is $1.12, up from a split-adjusted $0.90 in 2023.\n\nMore stores\n\nManagement thinks that it can double its current store count (about 3,500) in North America alone, with plenty of potential to expand internationally. It opened 47 stores in the 2024 first quarter, including 43 with a Chipotlane, or drive-thru.\n\nThat's important because Chipotlanes address consumer pain points. As the digital world has become a more present part of our lives, the ability to order and pick up with a drive-thru powers trust, engagement, and ultimately sales.\n\nFor all of 2024, the company expects to open between 285 and 315 stores -- more than the 271 it opened last year -- with 80% having a Chipotlane.\n\nManagement has said it will focus on suburban areas and international locations. It recently announced its first-ever franchise agreement for stores in the Middle East, and it opened a Kuwait location in April. It plans to open in Dubai later this year and have a total of four regional restaurants by the end of 2024.\n\nThese won't necessarily add tons of revenue to the total, but it's an experiment that could lead to further international openings. There are advantages to keeping all of the stores company owned, such as more control over the food, but there are advantages to expanding the franchise business, such as widening margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nHappy investors\n\nNothing has changed in Chipotle's performance or potential since the split, but some of its year-to-date gains were based on stock-split hype. The price is slightly down since, and its valuation is more in line with recent levels.\n\nThat means it's in a good position to start climbing again. There are no guarantees, but there's no reason to think anything should change in the back half of the year.\n\nChipotle runs an excellent business and has excellent prospects. In any case, investors should focus on the long term, and the company has plenty of room to run over many years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: MicroStrategy Is Next",
        "content": "The stock market has seen plenty of stock splits in 2024. Driven higher chiefly by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and slower inflation trends, several high-priced stocks have been sliced into a larger number of smaller shares.\n\nExamples of big-name announcements so far include a 10-for-1 split of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares in early June, a 50-for-1 split in Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) two weeks later, and Broadcom's (NASDAQ: AVGO) 10-for-1 split over this very weekend. This was Nvidia's second split since 2006. In contrast, the other two industry titans had never resliced their shares before.\n\nNone of these stock splits added or burned any real value for shareholders. The splits merely rearranged the same total market value into a larger number of shares, reducing the price per share and making the stock more accessible.\n\nNext in line: MicroStrategy\n\nSo who's next in line for a stock split? As it turns out, the winning name is business intelligence specialist MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR). The board of directors decided on a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this week, to be executed after the closing bell on Thursday, Aug. 1.\r\n\r\nThe company hadn't executed a split since a 1-for-10 reverse split to prop up a fading stock price in 2002. Founder and chairman Michael Saylor's all-in bet on Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) as an alternative to cash reserves has worked wonders so far. The stock is up more than 225% over the last 52 weeks and 1,060% in four years, driven by smaller gains in Bitcoin's price per coin. These days, MicroStrategy stock is changing hands for the princely sum of $1,310 per share.\n\nAnd MicroStrategy has evolved into a pretty direct bet on Bitcoin in recent years. Is it time to slice MicroStrategy's stock differently? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicroStrategy's recent financial maneuvers\n\nMicroStrategy's stock chart and financial activities in 2024 sent strong hints of a possible stock split.\n\nFor example, MicroStrategy recently completed an $800 million offering of 2.25% convertible senior notes due in 2032. The notes are convertible into cash, shares of MicroStrategy's class A common stock, or a combination of both. Notably, the initial conversion price is approximately $2,043.32 per share, a 35% premium over the stock's average price on June 13. This premium indicates strong investor confidence in MicroStrategy's stock performance.\n\nAdditionally, the stock has been floating higher on Saylor's Bitcoin strategy. At the end of March, the company held approximately 214,300 Bitcoins with a market value of $15.2 billion. The company has consistently added to its Bitcoin holdings, financed by cash flows from the software business, stock sales, and fresh debt papers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMichael Saylor's company raised over $1.5 billion in the first quarter alone through convertible debt offerings, using that cash to acquire 25,250 additional Bitcoins. MicroStrategy also raised $800 million in new debt on June 18, aiming to purchase some more Bitcoin with the proceeds.\n\nAmid this bustling Bitcoin-buying action, the cryptocurrency's price has increased more than 90% over the last year. Most market watchers (myself included) expect the Bitcoin gains to continue in the second half of 2024 and next year, powered by the predictable patterns of Bitcoin's halving cycles and the recent addition of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on real-time Bitcoin prices. If that theory plays out as expected, MicroStrategy's stock should also see even higher stock prices over the same period.\n\nWhy a stock split makes sense for MicroStrategy\n\nGiven MicroStrategy's soaring stock price and Saylor's daring financial strategies, the announced 10-for-1 stock split makes MicroStrategy shares more accessible to a broader range of investors. Currently trading just over $1,300 per share, the stock's high price can be a barrier of entry for smaller investors -- especially if they are unaware of or uncomfortable with buying fractional shares of high-priced stocks. Low-budget investors will find it easier to reach for a stock priced around $130 per share.\n\nSo MicroStrategy's strategic financial maneuvers, strong Bitcoin holdings, and high stock price create an ideal environment for a stock split. Now that the split is coming soon, investors should still keep a close watch on this tech veteran and crypto maven. Only time will tell how the Bitcoin-centric strategy will work out in the long run, but it's certainly off to a good start.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MicroStrategy wasn\u2019t one of them.

There are two ways for a restaurant chain to do that, and the leadership team is focused on both of them. Here's what you need to watch at Chipotle over the next three years to make sure that the company is living up to its own plans.\n\nChipotle has five goals, but really only two\n\nIn Chipotle Mexican Grill's 10-K, there is a section titled \"Business Strategy,\" in which it explains that it has five fundamental goals:\n\nSustaining world class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level;\n\nRunning successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences;\n\nMaking the brand visible, relevant, and loved to improve overall guest engagement;\n\nAmplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain; and\n\nExpanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally.\n\nThose are all important, but they really can be distilled down into just two main objectives: run the existing restaurant fleet at a high level and open new locations. The first quarter of 2024 showed that Chipotle is capable of doing both quite well.\n\nWith regard to existing restaurants, same-store sales, which measures sales at locations open for at least a year, expanded at a roughly 7% clip. Half that level would be considered a pretty good result in the restaurant business, so whatever Chipotle's is doing with its brand concept is clearly resonating with customers.\n\nMeanwhile, overall sales rose a touch over 14% to $2.7 billion. The only way that number gets significantly larger than same-store sales is by adding new locations. So, based on the numbers, Chipotle is firing on all cylinders today.\n\nWhat about the future for Chipotle?\n\nChipotle currently operates around 3,500 restaurants globally. That's a pretty big number, but it is nowhere near as large as other brands with which it competes. For example, McDonald's has more than 41,000 locations around the world. To be fair, McDonald's is one of the largest restaurant companies on Earth, but it still suggests there's a huge runway for growth ahead. A more comparable brand might be Taco Bell, owned by Yum! Brands, which has around 8,500 locations and sales of nearly $16 billion.\n\nSo it looks like Chipotle could add another 5,000 stores at the low end. Its revenue, annualizing the first-quarter tally, would be somewhere near $11 billion today. That's about $5 billion lower than Yum! Brands' Taco Bell. Even if Chipotle never reaches the scale of McDonald's, the next three, five, and even 10 years are likely to be filled with growth. It's worth noting the company only opened 47 new locations in the first quarter. That's a pace of roughly 200 a year, which means that it would require well more than a decade to get to Taco Bell's scale.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's no way for Chipotle to instantly reach the size of Taco Bell or McDonald's. It has to build that growth from the ground up while still executing well at its existing restaurants. That's not an easy task, and there are going to be bumps in the road along the way. Put another way, don't expect every quarter to be as good as Q1 2024.\n\nBut the next three years will still likely produce a lot of growth in the business. Perhaps the company \"only\" gets to 4,100 locations in that time, but that's still going to have a meaningful impact on the top and bottom lines. If you are considering investing in Chipotle today, well, very little has changed about its long-term growth story.\n\nPaying up for growth at Chipotle\n\nThe problem with Chipotle is that Wall Street is well aware of its strong growth story. Looking at the most commonly used valuation metric, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 63.5 versus a five-year average of 69.5. You can argue that P/E being below the long-term average suggests shares are cheap, but it is hard to call 63.5 a low number.\n\nYou are paying a premium for growth at Chipotle, which means this stock is most appropriate for more aggressive investors. Still, if history is any guide, Chipotle knows how to deliver what investors are expecting.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle Rout Amid Portion Debate Is Chance to Buy, Analysts Say",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A hubbub on social media over Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.\u2019s portion sizes has sent the burrito chain\u2019s shares into their worst tailspin in nearly a year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Vows to Stay in 2024 Race Even as NATO Gaffes Risk His Campaign Biden\u2019s Putin-Zelenskiy Gaffe Deals Fresh Blow to Campaign JPMorgan Notches Record Profit on Visa Gain, Dealmaking Jump Tesla Delays Robotaxi Event in Blow to Musk\u2019s Autonomy Drive FCC Says It\u2019s Investigating Massive Breach of AT&T Customer Data\n\nFor Wall Street bulls, the rout that has wiped out almost $7 billion in market value presents a buying opportunity. They argue that the backlash won\u2019t last long enough to justify the extent of the selloff, even as consumers continue to scrutinize price increases and perceived \u2018shrinkflation\u2019 at dining establishments.\n\n\u201cClearly, consumers are disgruntled by the value proposition across the industry and are pushing back,\u201d BTIG analyst Peter Saleh wrote in a note to clients. \u201cAny pullback in shares on this dynamic will be short-lived and represents a buying opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe stock plunged 8% in the past five days and is now down 16% from a record set last month. Chipotle\u2019s 50-for-1 stock split in late June added to volatility in recent weeks.\n\nSaleh said that Chipotle is just the latest restaurant chain to face criticism on social media. He noted that Starbucks Corp. has faced backlash over its perceived stance on the Israel-Hamas war, which the company has sought to counter. And, in a case more similar to Chipotle\u2019s, consumers took to social media to complain about price increases at McDonald\u2019s Corp. earlier this year.\n\nChipotle\u2019s criticism online comes from diners who say its serving sizes have shrunk, though Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol has denied the claims. The complaints got some validity from a Wells Fargo note in late June that said its analysts\u2019 research found that Chipotle\u2019s portions varied widely.\n\nEric Clark, a portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors, said he would be a buyer of recent weakness, touting the company\u2019s appeal to a younger demographic with more discretionary income, its higher quality of food and potential to open more locations. He already owns the stock.\n\n\u201cChipotle is an expensive stock and it\u2019s always been, but it has great growth characteristics,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Stifel, analyst Chris O\u2019Cull said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was some \u201cshort-term disruption\u201d from customers\u2019 claims about small portions, but he views any pullbacks related to this concern as a chance to buy Chipotle shares. O\u2019Cull also boosted his comparable sales estimate for the second quarter after mobile location data suggested that Chipotle\u2019s traffic was strong.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts tracked by Bloomberg expect Chipotle\u2019s comparable sales rose about 9% in the second quarter, faster than the year-ago period. They anticipate the chain\u2019s profit jumped 24% in the period, representing a deceleration from the previous year.\n\nAn additional watch point came with the announcement this week that long-standing Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung will retire, and Vice President of Finance Adam Rymer will take over on Jan. 1. Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro acknowledged that Rymer \u201chas big shoes to fill,\u201d but he ultimately expects a smooth transition.\n\nTo be sure, Chipotle isn\u2019t the only restaurant stock that\u2019s retreated recently. The S&P Composite 1500 Restaurants Index is set to drop for a third straight week in the longest losing streak since March. The group has come under pressure amid increasing worries about how consumers are holding up given persistent inflation and elevated borrowing costs.\n\nSaleh at BTIG said sentiment for restaurant stocks into second-quarter earnings season is the poorest it\u2019s been since concerns around the impact of appetite-suppressing medications hit the industry late last summer. He called the recent weakness \u201cwarranted,\u201d especially for fast-food chains as price wars intensify. Saleh favors restaurants like Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc., which he said has several company-specific sales drivers.\n\nChipotle, Domino\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s are among restaurant operators expected to report results later this month, with earnings from others including Wendy\u2019s Co. and YUM! Brands Inc. anticipated to follow in August.\n\n--With assistance from Janet Freund.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel He\u2019s Starting an Olympics Rival Where the Athletes Are on Steroids\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "One of the most important factors for investors to consider is growth. But how does one easily identify which companies are doing the best job growing? My solution is to look to the Portfolio Grader for A-rated growth stocks.\n\nWhile it\u2019s great that a stock is seeing gains over the last few weeks or months, growth is the name of the game, a fundamental aspect of success and sustainability. Companies that are seeing growth are more likely to remain strong and be long-term investments.\n\nCompanies need growth to scale and improve efficiency. If you\u2019re a car manufacturer and selling 30 cars per month, you\u2019re absorbing a lot of overhead to make those vehicles \u2013 and you\u2019re likely not turning a profit. But if you\u2019re making 3,000 vehicles, your per-unit costs go way down. That\u2019s how companies become profitable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGrowth enables a company to expand its market share. By increasing sales and acquiring new customers, companies become stronger and eventually, with enough growth, becomes a leader in their industries.\n\nI\u2019ve selected several A-rated growth stocks to review, based on their outstanding overall grades in the Portfolio Grader. The Portfolio Grader considers a variety of factors, including growth, earnings performance, analyst sentiment and momentum. So, A-rated stocks are the strongest overall companies in the market.\n\nBut what makes these A-rated growth stocks stand out today is that all the companies we\u2019re going to consider also get either an \u201cA\u201d or a \u201cB\u201d grade in the Portfolio Grader for growth.\n\nYou can expect each of these A-rated growth stocks to continue to perform, because the companies they represent are successfully expanding \u2013 and you can see it in the bottom line.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) may be the most compelling stock in the market. As the maker of powerful graphics processing units that are used to power top-line artificial intelligence programs, Nvidia stock soared to previously unimaginable heights. The stock is up 220% over the last 12 months and 170% so far this year.\n\nBut interestingly, Nvidia seems to be on a bit of a break. Since June 18, the stock is up only 3%, raising concerns from some nervous investors that we may finally be nearing a top.\n\nNonsense.\n\nI think it\u2019s more likely that this is just part of the Wall Street summer doldrums \u2013 when the market sees less activity from Memorial Day to Labor day. But remember that Nvidia\u2019s next earnings release is scheduled for Aug. 21, so this hiatus will surely come to an end sooner rather than later.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdjusted earnings for Nvidia were up 461% in the most recently reported quarter. And since earnings are far outpacing the stock\u2019s growth, Nvidia stock is getting cheaper every day on a valuation basis, which makes it among the A-rated growth stocks you need in your portfolio.\n\nNVDA stock gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for both growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo. It\u2019s responsible for the Chome search engine and Android smartphones. Alphabet is a powerhouse that\u2019s taken its rightful place, as has Nvidia, as a Magnificent 7 stock.\n\nSo then, why is the CEO selling shares?\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly sold\u00a022,500 Alphabet shares\u00a0on June 20, raising some investor eyebrows. I wrote about it recently for InvestorPlace, and as I said then, Pichai still has 227,000 shares of GOOG stock, so I\u2019m not concerned at all. In fact, this is more of a position-trimming move than anything else.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be bullish about Alphabet, including its massive position in internet search and the dominance of the Chrome browser. Alphabet brought in $80.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 15% from a year ago. Its operating income was up 32% to $25.4 billion.\n\nGOOG stock is up 36% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and an \u201cA\u201d overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is the third and last Magnificent 7 stock we\u2019ll talk about today. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the operator of the powerful social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Reels.\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerburg and friends at Harvard University, Meta is powerful because it encourages users to connect with friends and family and make new connections.\n\nPeople who use Facebook and Instagram willingly share their likes and dislikes, where they\u2019ve been and what they plan to do \u2013 and that\u2019s all information that Meta can use to sell to advertisers.\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 advertising platforms are powerful, there\u2019s no doubt. With all the personal information in Meta\u2019s databases, advertisers can make extremely targeted advertising campaigns.\n\nThat\u2019s why Meta brought in $36.4 billion in advertising revenue in the first quarter, making up roughly 98% of its total revenue. Advertising dollars were up 23% from a year ago, making this one of the A-rated growth stocks to keep your eyes on.\n\nI\u2019m expecting that trend to continue and META stock to pop again when the company reports earnings on July 31. For now, Meta stock is up 51% in 2024, and its gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not too often you see a company with a 50-to-1 stock split, as Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) executed this summer. But I like it because it\u2019s a sign of management that is very deliberate in its actions.\n\nChipotle stock topped $3,200 per share \u2013 an enormous number \u2013 before its June 25 split, making it one of the biggest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe split makes the stock more accessible and attractive to retail investors as well as employees who want to participate in the company\u2019s stock purchase plan \u2013 it was a good move all around.\n\nI also see the move as part of the company\u2019s culture. Remember, this is a restaurant stock with more than 3,400 locations, but no franchises. Chipotle maintains ownership of every location because it\u2019s the only way it can ensure company quality and standards.\n\nChipotle also famously doesn\u2019t have any freezers in its locations, which means that the ingredients for its burritos, salads and burrito bowls must always be made fresh.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up 14.1% from a year ago. Comparable restaurant sales were up 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%. The company is reporting second-quarter earnings on July 24.\n\nCMG stock is up 27% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and an \u201cA\u201d overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) isn\u2019t part of the Magnificent 7. But if the list ever expands to eight or 10 stocks, it might be difficult to keep Supermicro off the list.\n\nSupermicro makes the server infrastructure that is needed by companies that are buying up all the Nvidia GPUs to build large language models and other generative AI products. Supermicro can provide custom server architecture solutions to bundle those GPUs and allow them to work together.\n\nSupermicro is reportedly providing and assembling half of the racks AI-supercomputer racks that xAI, the artificial intelligence startup operated by Elon Musk, is creating to develop an AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\n\nThe company is seeing massive growth, with sales of $3.85 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $1.28 billion a year ago. Net income of $402 million was up from $86 million a year ago.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s another SMCI catalyst next week. Typically, Supermicro pre-announces between 18 and 24 days after the end of the quarter, so that could be as early as next week. Should the company provide evidence of another blowout quarter and/or dazzling guidance, SMCI stock will surely jump.\n\nSMCI stock is up 216% in 2024. It gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a computer security company that uses AI and machine learning to stop threats in real time. Its cloud-native platform that provides endpoint protection, cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform is its primary product, but CrowdStrike also offers modules that companies can use to customize their products.\n\nThe modules, which include things like endpoint security, data security, IT operations, threat intelligence and more, serves as a successful business plan because customers can always start small and add on as they go.\n\nCrowdStrike says 65% of its customers purchase and use at least five modules. Revenue for the company\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $921 million, up 33% from a year ago. Subscription revenue was $872.2 million, up 34% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nIt also got a boost last month when CWRD stock was added to the S&P 500, which means that exchange-traded funds and other products that track the index are buying CRWD stock.\n\nCrowdStrike stock is up 47% this year. It gets \u201cA\u201d rating for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was famously one of the original FAANG stocks that were considered market darlings before the rise of AI and the Magnificent 7. But Netflix, which is the premiere streaming service, hasn\u2019t really gone away.\n\nIn fact, the stock has only gotten better.\n\nNetflix management made a huge decision when it ended its free password sharing program. Before, the company all but encouraged the practice and password sharing was common between friends, family and partners was common.\n\nBut the company finally acknowledged that it was leaving a lot of money on the table, so the program came to an end. Netflix instituted an $8 monthly charge to any account that was sharing a password with someone outside the physical household. And now paid memberships are up from 232.6 million a year ago to 269.6 million in the last quarter.\n\nRevenue also grew \u2013 up 14.8% to $9.3 billion, and the stock returned to levels not seen since 2015.\n\nNFLX stock is up 39% this year, and gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had LONG position(s) in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.\u00a0Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had LONG positions in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) closed the most recent trading day at $57.55, moving -1.29% from the previous trading session. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.88% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.08%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.95%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the Mexican food chain had lost 8.07% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 1.55%, while the S&P 500 gained 5.11%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Chipotle Mexican Grill will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on July 24, 2024. In that report, analysts expect Chipotle Mexican Grill to post earnings of $0.31 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 24%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $2.93 billion, reflecting a 16.48% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $1.11 per share and a revenue of $11.35 billion, representing changes of +23.33% and +15%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Chipotle Mexican Grill. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.12% higher. At present, Chipotle Mexican Grill boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nWith respect to valuation, Chipotle Mexican Grill is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 52.65. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 18.8 for its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, CMG's PEG ratio is currently 2.32. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. CMG's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.73 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 87, positioning it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow CMG in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this Mexican food chain have returned -8.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, which Chipotle falls in, has lost 6.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Chipotle is expected to post earnings of $0.31 per share, indicating a change of +24% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.11 points to a change of +23.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.33 indicates a change of +20.2% from what Chipotle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Chipotle is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMG _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Chipotle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.93 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +16.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.35 billion and $12.84 billion estimates indicate +15% and +13.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nChipotle reported revenues of $2.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.1%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.01%. The EPS surprise was +14.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nChipotle is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Chipotle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Soaring Stocks I'd Buy Now With No Hesitation",
        "content": "One of the more difficult tasks in investing can be convincing yourself to buy a stock that has already been on a big run. Buying a stock when it's near an all-time high, or even a 52-week high, requires investors to clear a psychological hurdle. This makes intuitive sense, at least at first. If a stock is already up by a lot, it's easy to imagine that we've missed all the gains.\n\nFortunately, this is not always the case. The best companies in the world set new all-time highs frequently on their way to market-crushing long-term returns. Sure, buying into these companies earlier leads to better results, but in many cases, an investor can do just fine by picking up shares several years into a great stock run-up.\n\nHere are two stocks that have been soaring over the last year and a half, but that I'd buy right now anyway.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nOver the past year, fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) is up 51%, well outpacing the S&P 500's 27% gain. The stock's performance has been propelled by several quarters of impressive and consistent growth. For example, in Q1, revenue increased by 14% year over year while earnings per share grew by 24%. The company also generated $437 million in free cash flow.\n\nImportantly, this growth has been generated by both an increase in the number of Chipotle restaurants and by existing restaurants continuing to sell more. The company grew its total restaurant count by 8% year over year in the quarter while comparable restaurant sales were up 7%.\n\nThese metrics tell investors that Chipotle is still delighting its customers and that there is still plenty of growth to be found from adding new restaurants. This combination could mean further strong returns for shareholders.\n\nThat said, it is reasonable to ask if the stock might have already gotten too expensive. Chipotle is trading at 67 times its trailing earnings. That isn't cheap, but it is within the historical range of the stock. Premium companies are rarely cheap and Chipotle is no exception.\n\nAmazon\n\nIt's hard to believe that at the beginning of 2023, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was trading at its lowest price since 2019. However, since that point, the stock has rallied and is up 138%. Many investors counted Amazon out during its 2022 plunge, but those who hung on have been handsomely rewarded, as the stock has been setting new highs this summer.\n\nBoth the fall and the rebound make sense in context. After doubling its distribution footprint to meet pandemic-fueled demand, Amazon was left with a business that needed to be right-sized as most consumers were able to resume in-person shopping and their e-commerce usage reverted to levels closer to their pre-COVID norms. Amazon's operating income fell significantly from early 2021 through the end of 2022, spooking investors.\n\nStory continues AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIn hindsight, it is clear that Amazon just needed time to adjust to that shift, and throughout 2023, its operating income improved dramatically. The turnaround was driven specifically by the e-commerce part of the business, where it was able to get expenses under control. The results over the past year and a half have been impressive. AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAmazon trades at 56 times trailing earnings. However, unlike Chipotle, this valuation for Amazon is below its historical levels. Put another way, even after a triple-digit percentage return for the stock over the past year, an argument could be made that Amazon is still inexpensive, historically speaking.\n\nThe bottom line for investors\n\nChipotle and Amazon are fantastic businesses with long track records of success, and neither is showing any signs of slowing down. Their recent stock price appreciation shouldn't be a reason for investors to stay away from either company. Both look to me like compelling stocks to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "5 Reasons Broadcom Is a Better Stock-Split Stock to Buy Than Chipotle",
        "content": "The bigger the stock split, the better the stock? If that were the case, Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) would beat Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) like a drum. Chipotle conducted a 50-for-1 stock split on June 25. Broadcom will split its shares 10-for-1 following the market close on July 12.\n\nBut the size of the stock split has no bearing on the quality of the stock. If you're thinking about whether or not to buy Chipotle or Broadcom, the decision should be an easy one. Here are five reasons Broadcom is a better stock-split stock to buy than Chipotle.\n\n1. Better growth prospects\n\nChipotle's revenue rose 14% year over year in the first quarter of 2024. Its adjusted earnings per share jumped 27%. Unsurprisingly, its Chipotle stock has also performed quite well, vaulting nearly 30% higher so far this year.\n\nBroadcom's revenue soared 43% year over year in its fiscal second quarter thanks in large part to the acquisition of VMware. The company's adjusted earnings per share increased 6%. What's more important, though, are Broadcom's growth prospects going forward.\n\nVMware's contribution to Broadcom's total revenue should increase. Broadcom also has a huge growth opportunity with its artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators. The company looks for its networking revenue to increase 40% in 2024 primarily because of higher demand for AI systems.\n\nBroadcom stock has skyrocketed more than 50% year to date. I think the semiconductor and software maker's growth prospects are a bigger factor behind this impressive return than its quarterly results.\n\n2. More attractive valuation\n\nYou might think Broadcom's valuation would be less attractive than Chipotle's after its greater gains. Instead, the opposite is true.\n\nChipotle's shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 54.6. That's much higher than Broadcom's forward earnings multiple of nearly 29.2. Including expected growth makes Broadcom's valuation even more attractive. Chipotle's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 2.7 is more than twice Broadcom's PEG ratio of 1.3.\n\n3. More profitable\n\nLet's suppose that Broadcom and Chipotle had similar growth prospects and valuations. I'd still prefer Broadcom for one simple reason: It's more profitable than Chipotle.\n\nIn Chipotle's latest quarter, its net profit margin (using adjusted net income) was around 14%. That pales in comparison to Broadcom's fiscal Q2 adjusted net profit margin of more than 43%.\n\n4. Stronger free cash flow\n\nWhat's more important than profits? My answer is free cash flow. Profits can be manipulated relatively easily, but it's harder to finagle with free cash flow.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle generated free cash flow of nearly $995 million over the last 12 months. Broadcom's free cash flow during the same period topped $20 billion. Enough said.\n\n5. The dividend\n\nIf all of the above isn't enough to convince you of Broadcom's superiority versus Chipotle, look at the two stocks' dividends (or lack thereof). Broadcom's forward dividend yield of 1.2% isn't all that juicy. However, Chipotle doesn't offer a dividend at all. Over time, even a relatively small dividend can boost total returns considerably.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you\u2019d have $22,451!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $43,210!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $369,814!*\n\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 \u201cDouble Down\u201d stocks \u00bb\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of July 8, 2024\n\nKeith Speights has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "content": "Is Now A Good Time To Buy Regency Centers?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWhen investors consider acquiring a stock, they must uncover numerous variables to make an informed decision. They should assess the fundamentals of a stock, as well as its historical performance, dividend growth, and recent events.\n\nHowever, investors must also ask, \"Is this really an opportune moment to acquire this stock?\" \u00a0 How do analysts perceive the company\u2019s prospects? Does it have a unique niche? What was the most recent earnings report? What do technical indicators suggest about the risk of a purchase now?\n\nCan you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors.\n\nTake a look at one real estate investment trust (REIT) that has been checking many of the boxes lately after a few years of underperformance.\n\nRegency Centers Corp\n\nRegency Centers Corp (NASDAQ:REG) is a Jacksonville, FL-based retail REIT, founded in 1963 that owns and operates 482 open-air shopping center properties, totaling more than 61 million square feet in higher-income areas. Its portfolio, located largely on the East Coast of the U.S. with over 9,000 tenants, includes 80% grocery-anchored properties, restaurants, service providers, medical spaces, and higher-class retailers. As of June 2024, Regency had a 95.8% lease rate. Regency Centers is a member of the S&P 500.\n\nRecent news on this REIT has been quite positive. On May 2, Regency Centers reported its first quarter 2024 operating results. Funds From Operations (FFO) of $1.08 beat the consensus estimate of $1.03 and was equal to Regency's FFO of $1.08 in Q1 2023. Revenue of $357.46 million beat the consensus estimate of $346.96 million and easily topped Q1 2023 revenue of $311.94.\n\nOn May 9, Regency Centers announced the acquisition of the two Compo Shopping Centers in Westport, CT. Regency already owns an adjacent center called Compo Acres. With the acquisition of the new centers, the combined operation will be known as the Compo Acres Shopping Center and will comprise almost 120,000 square feet of high-quality retail space.\n\nOn June 26, Regency Centers announced a new Fast Charging Station for electric vehicles in partnership with EVgo Inc. (NASDAQ:EVGO) at Blakeney Town Center in Charlotte, N.C. Regency has developed approximately 40 of Evgo's 120+ charging stations across 10 states, and more are expected next year.\n\nOne analyst has recently lifted Regency's price target twice. On May 23, Mizuho analyst Haendel St. Juste maintained Regency Centers with a Neutral rating and bumped the price target from $60 to $61. Again, on July 9, Mizuho analyst Haendel St. Juste upgraded Regency Centers from Neutral to Outperform and raised the price target by 9.8% from $61 to $67.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately, Regency has not performed very well over the past 2.5 years. Its total return since Jan. 1, 2022, is -10.37%. Rising interest rates have hurt the share price despite steady earnings and increasing revenue. However, since April 15 of this year, Regency's total return has been 7.75%, so it's clearly on the upswing.\n\nRegency Centers pays a quarterly dividend of $0.67 per share. The annualized $2.68 dividend yields 4.34%. The dividend is well covered with a payout ratio of 63.9% on a forward annual FFO of $4.19. The P/FFO of 14.75 is above the Retail REIT sector median of 12.54, however, its recent close at $61.74 is still well below its 2022 high of $70.90.\n\nTrending: Mark Cuban believes \u201cthe next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment\u201d \u2014 this new real estate fund allows you to get started with just $100.\n\nRegency Centers has many notable strengths, and there are several reasons why now could be a good time to purchase shares:\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Having 80% of its strip malls grocery-anchored by leading supermarkets provides stability conducive to keeping present tenants and attracting new prospects should a tenant leave upon lease expiration. Its largest grocery store tenants include Publix, Safeway, Kroger, and Whole Foods Market.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Non-grocery tenants include publicly traded companies such as JP Morgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG).\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In its Q1 2024 operating results, Regency beat the analyst consensus estimates for FFO and revenue and topped its revenue from the same quarter a year ago.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Regency had a recent analyst upgrade and two price target hikes since late May.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It's expanding its partnership with EVgo to generate additional sources of revenue.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Regency's recent purchase of the Compo Shopping Centers will give it a tremendous presence in a well-to-do area of Connecticut.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Regency has increased its dividend four times over the past five years, with no cuts or suspensions. The payout ratio is moderate, so there is a minimal chance of a dividend cut in the immediate future.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In the last few days, Regency has formed the \"Golden Cross\" pattern on its chart, in which the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) has crossed above the 200-day SMA.\n\nSo, despite its lackluster performance since 2022, Regency Centers now appears to be a good stock for a long-term purchase. If the FED were to cut interest rates, that would certainly help lift the share price back to its pre-2022 price.\n\nOne caveat is that with the P/FFO at 14.75, the stock may be slightly overvalued until the FFO increases, and that could take a few quarters until the new Compo acquisitions and enhanced Evgo partnership become accretive to earnings.\n\nCheck Out Some of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "title": "Will Chipotle (CMG) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this Mexican food chain has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 13.96%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Chipotle came out with earnings of $0.27 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.23 per share, representing a surprise of 17.39%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.19 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.21 per share, delivering a surprise of 10.53%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Chipotle lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nChipotle has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on July 24, 2024.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The metaverse is still very much alive and well, creating opportunities for some of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nAt the moment, we\u2019re seeing metaverse growth in gaming and e-commerce. We\u2019re also seeing it in retail with IKEA and Nike (NYSE:NKE), for example. We\u2019re seeing it with McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) latest jump into the metaverse. Plus, we\u2019re seeing it in advertising, health and wellness, education and live entertainment.\n\nAccording to CoinTrust.com, the global metaverse market could grow 575% to nearly $500 billion by 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more.\n\nAs noted by TynMagazine.com, \u201cAccording to Statista\u2019s forecast, the total number of users in the metaverse landscape is projected to hit almost 2.6 billion by the end of the decade, four times more than the earlier forecast and three times more than this year.\u00a0The total addressable market or the revenue opportunity for metaverse products and services in the conservative scenario, where 15% of the digital economy shifts to the metaverse, is expected to hit $1.9 trillion in this period.\u201d\n\nThat said, I\u2019d use every dip in metaverse stocks as a buying opportunity.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to top metaverse stocks, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) will always be a top pick.\n\nFor one, multiple companies are working with Roblox to jump into the metaverse. That includes Nike, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Gucci, McDonald\u2019s and Forever 21 \u2014 to name a few. Two,\u00a0Roblox is the closest thing to a mainstream metaverse. It builds out a human co-experience platform that enables billions of users to come together to play, learn, communicate and explore.\n\nThree,\u00a0recent earnings negativity appears to have been priced into the rebounding stock.\u00a0Plus, analysts are bullish. Macquarie initiated coverage of RBLX with an Outperform rating, noting it\u2019s one of the main \u201cbuilding blox\u201d of the metaverse.\n\nMoffettNathanson also upgraded the stock with a $26 target after the sell-off in the stock.\u00a0Better, as RBLX continues to pivot higher with the metaverse story, it\u2019s a strong buy.\n\nLast trading at $39.82, the company just refilled its earnings gap in early May. From this price, I\u2019d like to see RBLX run back to $47 a share initially.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecent weakness in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also a strong buy opportunity. Currently trading at $128.20, I\u2019d like to see NVDA trade closer to $150 in the near term.\n\nWhile it\u2019s been driven by artificial intelligence, demand for its chips and strong earnings growth, it\u2019s also exposed to the metaverse with its Omniverse software.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith it, companies can create and test virtual environments all in real-time. Foxconn, for example, is using the Omniverse to create a digital twin of its\u00a0new factory in Guadalajara to train robots in a virtual environment.\n\nHelping, analysts at UBS (NYSE:UBS) say NVDA could earn $5 a share in 2025 as budgets for hyper-scalers begin to firm up. The firm also has a $150 price target.\n\nWolfe Research also raised its price target to $150, \u201cnoting that recent checks indicate a path to 50% or more content growth for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in 2025, with incremental upside coming from unit growth and better networking attach rates,\u201d as reported by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Metaverse stock. gaming cryptos\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you\u2019d rather diversify with an exchange-traded fund (ETF), there\u2019s also the\u00a0Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 40 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse\u2019s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030.\u00a0Some of its top holdings include\u00a0Nvidia, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Roblox, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nFueling upside, \u201cThe Metaverse\u2019s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033, signaling an era of unprecedented expansion,\u201d said RoundHill Investments.\n\nTwo, \u201cVR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026, indicating steady industry growth and market traction.\u201d\n\nBoth could help fuel a significant upside for METV.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Stocks to Buy: 3 Hidden Multibaggers Ready to Double Your Money",
        "content": "Multibagger stocks can help you reach your financial goals sooner. And, many growth stocks have enjoyed incredible rallies. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the multibagger on everyone\u2019s mind. While the artificial intelligence (AI) leader can still generate higher returns for long-term investors, it\u2019s been thrown into the open.\n\nFinding hidden multibaggers can lead to higher long-term gains. Although Nvidia has gained more than 3,000% over the past five years, it\u2019s unlikely to repeat that growth over the next five years. While it\u2019s difficult for any stock to achieve those returns, it\u2019s possible to find stocks that more than double within a few years.\n\nTherefore, investors should set their horizons on companies that have rising revenue and profit margin growth. And these corporations with long-term catalysts can spark further stock gains. These three stocks fulfill those parameters, but they aren\u2019t as well-known. None of these stocks are currently in the S&P 500 and remain hidden. Let\u2019s uncover them now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an educational tech company that makes it easier for people to learn new languages. The company offers verbal and written activities to assist people on the language learning journey. The gamified experience keeps people coming back, based on Duolingo\u2019s 31.4 million daily active users. That\u2019s a 54% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Additionally, the number of monthly active users jumped by 35% YOY to reach 97.6 million.\n\nMoreover, revenue and earnings growth rates remained elevated as more people flocked to the Duolingo app. Revenue increased by 45% YOY while net income reached $27.0 million. That\u2019s a big turnaround from the company\u2019s $2.6 million net loss in the same quarter last year.\n\nNotably, Duolingo is quickly gaining momentum and is up by 37% over the past year. The stock has a high P/E ratio, but net profit margins have been soaring. Hence, higher profits and continued revenue growth can make the $8 billion corporation attractive for long-term investors.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurant stocks have taken off in recent years. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been\u00a0 capturing plenty of attention as it\u2019s more than quadrupled over the past five years. A recent 50-for-1 stock split has made Chipotle more affordable on a price-per-share perspective, further bringing more attention to the stock.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t about Chipotle. It\u2019s about Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH). The steakhouse chain has also benefitted from the growing demand for restaurant stocks. Shares are up by 40% year-to-date (YTD), more than tripling over the past five years. Yet, Texas Roadhouse still has a reasonable 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.46% yield. Very few high-growth restaurant stocks offer a decent P/E ratio and a dividend. Most of them offer neither.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the company reported 12.5% YOY revenue growth and 31.0% YOY net income growth in the first quarter. Comparable restaurant sales jumped by 8.4% YOY, demonstrating plenty of demand for the company\u2019s restaurants. Texas Roadhouse has 753 restaurants. The company owns 644 of those restaurants, and the remaining 109 restaurants are franchises.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is closing in on S&P 500 eligibility. The cosmetics firm has gained more than 1,300% over the past five years. Shares are up by 45% YTD amid strong financials. Elf Beauty reported 71% YOY revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. The company has now reported 21 consecutive quarters of net sales and market growth. Also, Elf Beauty gained market share for the 5th consecutive year while other beauty firms like Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) are reporting decelerating sales growth.\n\nIn addition, Elf Beauty caters to Gen Z and other generations for using cruelty-free ingredients in its beauty products. The efforts have paid off based on recent financial results. Elf Beauty\u2019s fiscal 2025 outlook suggests the stock can gain more ground. Commentary from Tarang Amin, Elf Beauty Chief Executive Officer (CEO), suggests additional catalysts.\n\n\u201cAs we look ahead, we believe we are still in the early innings of unlocking the full potential we see for e.l.f. Beauty across cosmetics, skin care and international markets,\u201d Amin stated.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA, TXRH, and ELF.

Before the split, one share of CMG stock cost more than $3,200. Now, investors can buy shares for $59 each.\n\nIn a hit to the share price, Wedbush recently downgraded the stock to \"neutral\" with a new price target of $3,200, while TD Cowen and Baird maintained their positive ratings with targets of $3,600 and $3,500, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nChipotle and other companies have lately been accused of \u201cshrinkflation\u201d \u2014 the idea of getting less for the same price.\n\nA study by Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem brought to light substantial inconsistencies in Chipotle\u2019s portion sizes. Fadem\u2019s team ordered the same burrito bowl 75 times from various locations in New York City, revealing significant variation in weights, with some bowls weighing under 15 ounces and others over 21 ounces.\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nBP expects to book an impairment of up to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) for the second quarter, and warned that its oil-trading earnings will take a hit of up to $700m from lower refining margins.\n\nIn a trading statement, the oil giant said its second quarter results would show \u201cpost-tax adverse reporting items\u201d relating to its ageing refining operations in Germany.\n\n\u201cThe second quarter results are expected to include post tax adverse adjusting items relating to asset impairments and associated onerous contract provisions in the range of $1bn to $2bn.\n\n\u201cThis includes charges relating to the ongoing review of our Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany,\u201d BP said.\n\nRead more: Top five pensions priorities for the new Labour government\n\nThe company said it anticipates weak refining margins and oil trading performance will weigh on its second-quarter results, due out on 30 July.

Another 35 planes will be grounded next summer.\n\n\"We are making assumptions that Airbus will have delivery delays, but they already have six-month delivery delays,\" he told Reuters. \"The real impact will be fairly limited,\" Varadi added.\n\nThe European plane maker cut its targets last month as it faces ongoing supply disruptions.\n\nVaradi said the airline is still expecting continuous deliveries of about three aircraft a month, with 20% growth in capacity next year and 20% to 25% the following year.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Investing in the right stocks can lead to life-changing returns, especially if you have a lengthy time horizon. Compounding does its magic when you don\u2019t touch your investment for many years. If you get an 8% return on your $10,000 investment, it becomes $10,800 at the end of the year.\n\nHowever, an investor who gets an annualized 8% return over the next 30 years will turn their $10,000 into $100,626.57. That also includes the investor isn\u2019t making any additional contributions to their portfolio. That\u2019s why Charlie Munger said the first $100,000 is the hardest. Once you reach that level, it becomes easier to make the next $100,000 because of compounding.\n\nSome growth stocks grow at a faster rate than 8% per year. It\u2019s possible to find stocks maintaining annualized double-digit growth rates for over a decade. Investors looking for promising long-term opportunities may consider these enticing growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been delivering explosive returns for several years. The stock is up by 34% year-to-date and has tripled over the past five years. Online advertising continues to attract millions of businesses and generate more revenue for Alphabet.\n\nThe advertising segment was a major reason the company reported 15% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. Net income growth outpaced revenue growth, which resulted in a 29.4% net profit margin. Alphabet is trimming its workforce while delivering higher revenue growth.\n\nGoogle Cloud is growing faster than the company\u2019s advertising services. As AI tailwinds manifest themselves, the company\u2019s cloud platform should experience elevated growth in the upcoming quarters.\n\nWall Street believes that AI tailwinds and other factors will result in solutions for long-term investors. Alphabet is rated as a Strong Buy with a projected 7% upside. The highest price target of $225 per share suggests that Alphabet can gain an additional 21%.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also delivered impressive long-term returns for investors. The stock is up 24% year-to-date and has gained 236% over the past five years. The tech giant also offers a 0.65% yield and has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nAlthough Microsoft has numerous business segments, Microsoft Cloud is the most important one. Cloud revenue reached $35.1 billion in Q3 FY 24, 23% higher than last year\u2019s revenue. That\u2019s more than half of the company\u2019s $61.9 billion in revenue for the quarter. Overall revenue increased by 17 years over year, while net income was up by 20 years over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft also has exposure to social media, gaming, advertising, business software and other verticals. Copilot makes it easier for the company to expand into additional industries and gain market share in its existing verticals. Copilot for Security has helped Microsoft strengthen its presence in the cybersecurity industry.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) An image of the Caterpillar tractor brand logo.\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has been a construction leader for almost 100 years. The firm provides essential equipment that helps contractors and construction businesses fulfill projects.\u00a0The company\u00a0raised its dividend by 8% earlier this year\u00a0but\u00a0already offers a 1.72%\u00a0yield. It\u2019s rare to see a company with a high growth rate and\u00a0yield, but Caterpillar delivers.\n\nYou\u2019ll also\u00a0see plenty of growth in\u00a0the stock price.\u00a0The firm trades at a P/E of 15x and is up\u00a0by\u00a0142% over the past five years. Caterpillar reported 47% year-over-year net income growth in the\u00a0first quarter\u00a0and deployed $5.1 billion toward share repurchases and dividend distributions.\n\n16 Wall Street analysts rate Caterpillar stock as a moderate buy. The average price target suggests a 13% upside from current levels. Some analysts are even more bullish. The highest price target of $440 per share indicates that Caterpillar can rally by an additional 34%.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery. Growth stocks\n\nSource: C H A L N / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is a search engine marketing tool that generates $354.2 million in annual recurring revenue. This Q1 figure represents a 21% year-over-year improvement. A yearly recurring revenue model makes it easier for Semrush to scale its finances over time. The company can increase its revenue by attracting more customers, raising prices and incentivizing existing customers to upgrade their accounts. Semrush has been able to do just that.\n\n\u201cWe continue to succeed in executing on our core growth pillars by onboarding more customers, cross-selling and up-selling to existing customers and leveraging AI in our platform to ensure businesses of any size have the most valuable digital marketing software suite,\u201d Semrush CEO and co-founder Oleg Shchegolev explained in the Q1 press release.\n\nSemrush closed the first quarter with nearly 112,000 paying customers, which is a 10% year-over-year improvement. The company also generated $2.1 million in net income and offered encouraging guidance. These signs point to a growth stock that can deliver long-term gains.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) has been in the rumor mill for several months. Tech giants are looking at the company as an acquisition target, which can lead to a big payday for investors. The speculation has helped this year, as the stock is only up 8% year-to-date. However, shares have more than tripled over the past five years, giving a better idea of what can happen when momentum accumulates.\n\nThe customer relationship management software continues to deliver impressive results. Revenue increased by 23% year-over-year in the first quarter to $617.4 million. Net income came to $5.9 million, compared to a net loss of $36.6 million in the same quarter last year. HubSpot also has a healthy balance sheet, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments.\n\nHubSpot\u2019s customer base grew by 22% year over year to reach 216,840 customers. That\u2019s plenty of recurring revenue for the company, and the average customer has an annual subscription of $11,447. It\u2019s no wonder big tech is circling HubSpot.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle Mexican fast food chain restaurant at night. CMG stock\n\nSource: Hrach Hovhannisyan / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been cooking up tasty returns for several years. The stock is up by 39% year-to-date and has more than quadrupled over the past five years. Shares are fresh from a stock split and have attracted plenty of Wall Street bulls. Chipotle is currently rated as a Moderate Buy with a projected 7% upside. The highest price target of $80 per share suggests that Chipotle can gain an additional 29% from current levels.\n\nRecent financial results warrant optimism. In the first quarter, Chipotle reported 14.1% year-over-year revenue growth, while diluted earnings per share increased by 23.9% year-over-year. Chipotle closed out the quarter with a 13.3% net profit margin.\n\nThe fast-food restaurant chain remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants this year. Chipotle opened an additional 47 restaurants in the first quarter, 43 of which were Chipotlanes. Chipotle has delivered impressive financials while raising prices and demanding strong customer loyalty.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) offers a suite of financial products and innovates in the industry. Some of the company\u2019s Gold perks are hard to beat, such as a credit card with unlimited 3% cashback, a 1% boost on all qualifying deposits and 3% contribution matches for IRAs.\n\nThe brokerage firm has been a rough hold for several years, but the stock has flipped the script. Shares have surged by an astonishing 81% year-to-date as the company delivers high profits. Robinhood reported 40% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, generating $157 million in net income.

        "content": "Investing requires patience and a long time horizon to generate sizable profits. It\u2019s no secret that the most successful investors are people such as Warren Buffett, who are infinitely patient and hold stocks in their portfolios for decades. Buffett famously said, \u201cThe stock market is a device to transfer money from the \u2018impatient\u2019 to the \u2018patient.'\u201d\n\nWhile patience is certainly a virtue when it comes to investing, it also helps to identify strong companies when they first come to market and take a position early in their life as a publicly traded concern. This is when companies are experiencing rapid growth and have a long runway ahead of them. Spotting winning overlooked growth stocks, taking a position early and holding on for the long-term is a recipe for success as an investor.\n\nHere are three overlooked growth stocks for patient investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nMediterranean restaurant chain Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) has only been publicly traded for a year but has enjoyed an incredible run. Since its initial public offering (IPO) in June 2023, CAVA stock has increased 150%. The company is also profitable and has reported financial results that consistently top Wall Street forecasts. This makes Cava Group one of the most successful IPOs of the last five years.\n\nThe company\u2019s strong financial results are driven by huge growth, which continues to create an enormous market opportunity. For this year\u2019s first quarter, Cava reported EPS of 13 cents, more than double the 5 cents expected among analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $259 million, ahead of Wall Street expectations for $246 million. Sales were up 30% from a year earlier.\n\nMuch of the growth came from Cava\u2019s rapid expansion as the company opened 14 new\r\nrestaurant locations during the quarter, bringing its national count to 323 outlets. According to management, Cava is now forecasting full-year earnings of $100 million to $105 million. That\u2019s an increase from an earlier forecast of $86 million to $92 million. Many analysts compare Cava to Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo on the paper document and large microchips placed around.

Since going public in September 2023, ARM stock has risen 200%. And more gains appear likely. The growth trajectory of ARM stock has been so strong that the company was just added to the Nasdaq 100 index, replacing satellite radio provider Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI).\n\nStory continues\n\nArm Holdings was added to the Nasdaq 100 due to its explosive market capitalization approaching $200 billion. Like Cava, Arm is already profitable and growing at a brisk clip. The company most recently reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $928 million, a 47% increase from a year ago. Demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips is powering its sales growth. In terms of profit, Arm earned 36 cents per share, beating forecasts of 31 cents a share.\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX) Light blue pills on white background.

Schmidt / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorried that you\u2019ve missed out on the boom in weight loss drugs with pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). Not to worry. You can still gain exposure to the weight loss drug trade with Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX), the newest and potentially most explosive entrant in the weight loss drug market. VKTX stock is up 180% this year on reports that its weight loss candidate has shown extremely good results.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another reason to consider Viking Therapeutics stock. Rumors that a larger pharmaceutical company such as\u00a0Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) might acquire Viking Therapeutics to gain access to its weight loss drugs acting as a catalyst for the stock too. Whether Viking remains independent and brings its weight loss drug to market or is acquired by a larger company at a premium price, investors don\u2019t look likely to lose with VKTX stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in LLY.

        "title": "Wall Street's Next Stock Split -- a 27,000%-Gainer Since Its IPO -- Is Imminent, and I'm Not Talking About Broadcom",
        "content": "At the moment, there's probably not a hotter trend on Wall Street than artificial intelligence (AI). But companies enacting stock splits comes in a very close second.\n\nA stock split is a mechanism that allows publicly traded companies to superficially alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's cosmetic in the sense that a stock split doesn't change a company's market cap, and it has no impact on its operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock-split stocks come in two varieties: forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, a public company is making its shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases through their broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase a company's share price, usually with the purpose of ensuring that it meets the minimum continued listing standards for a major stock exchange.\n\nAlthough both categories can produce long-term winners, most investors tend to gravitate to companies conducting forward-stock splits. High-flying stocks that need to make their share price more nominally affordable for retail investors are typically companies that have out-innovated and out-executed their peers. In other words, the type of business we'd expect to continue rising in value.\n\nFurthermore, companies undertaking forward-stock splits have outperformed the broader market for more than four decades. According to a study from Bank of America Global Research, companies announcing forward splits have generated an average return of 25.4% (since 1980) in the 12 months following their initial split announcement. This compares to an average return of 11.9% for the benchmark S&P 500 over the same timeline.\n\nPiling into stock-split stocks has been a winning strategy, and there's another premier name on deck to join this exclusive club of outperformers.\n\nNearly a dozen high-profile businesses have announced stock splits in 2024\n\nBefore diving into Wall Street's next stock-split stock, it's worth recognizing that nearly a dozen time-tested businesses have announced stock splits in 2024.\n\nPerhaps the best example of a stock-split stock that investors flocked to in droves is the company propelling the AI revolution, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Following a nearly $3 trillion increase in market cap since the start of 2023, Nvidia's board approved a 10-for-1 forward stock split on May 22, which became effective following the closing bell on June 7.\n\nIn a very short time span, Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) became the preferred choice of pretty much every business looking to train large language models and run generative AI solutions in their high-compute data centers. With demand for Nvidia's chips handily outweighing their supply, the company has enjoyed exceptional pricing power and operational scaling that will be written about in textbooks for decades to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nFast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) also joined the club this year. With its stock trading at roughly $3,000 per share, the company's board announced a 50-for-1 split on March 19, which went into effect after the closing bell on June 25. The magnitude of this split (50-for-1) is one of the largest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nChipotle's claim to success has always been its transparent food preparation, which involves the use of responsibly raised meats and locally sourced vegetables (when possible), as well as its limited menu. Keeping its menu relatively small helps its employees quickly prepare meals, and ensures that lines in its stores keep moving.\n\nThe other big-time stock split that investors are eagerly awaiting is networking solutions specialist Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). The company's board approved a 10-for-1 forward split on June 12, with this share price adjustment scheduled to take place following the close of business on July 12.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, Broadcom has taken the bull the by the proverbial horns and ridden its first-mover advantages in the AI networking space to sizable gains. It introduced its Jericho3-AI chip last year, which can connect up to 32,000 GPUs in high-compute data centers. Broadcom's AI solutions are designed to reduce tail latency and help maximize the computational potential of AI-GPUs. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWall Street's newest stock-split stock has gained 27,000% since its IPO\n\nWhile most investors are probably eyeing Broadcom like a hawk for its upcoming stock split at the end of this week, there's another highflier with an even more impressive long-term track record that's imminently splitting its stock.\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in July 1983, home furnishings retailer Williams-Sonoma(NYSE: WSM) has seen its stock climb by roughly 27,000%, or more than 41,100% if you add in dividend payments.\n\nSince its IPO, the company behind such brands as Pottery Barn, West Elm, Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham, and its namesake Williams-Sonoma, has completed seven forward-stock splits:\n\nJune 1986: 3-for-2 split June 1989: 3-for-2 July 1990: 3-for-2 February 1994: 3-for-2 September 1994: 3-for-2 May 1998: 2-for-1 May 2002: 2-for-1\n\nFollowing a 22-year gap since its last stock split, Williams-Sonoma's board approved a 2-for-1 split via stock dividend on June 13. This split will take effect after the close of business on... drumroll... Monday, July 8. This means when Williams-Sonoma opens for trading tomorrow morning, it'll be trading at closer to $140 per share.\n\nSimilar to what Walmart and Chipotle have echoed when announcing their stock splits in 2024, Williams-Sonoma is angling to \"make its stock more accessible to investors and employees.\" For companies with employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), it's often a lot easier to encourage employees to invest when the share price is lower. This seems to be the motivation to carry out the company's eighth split since going public.\n\nOne of the key reasons Williams-Sonoma has seen its margins improve is the company's decisive emphasis on e-commerce. While it continues to have a brick-and-mortar presence, two-thirds of the company's sales can be traced to its digital channels. The company's 11.1% compound annual growth rate from e-commerce since 2019 has helped to keep overhead costs under control.\n\nAnother reason for Williams-Sonoma's ongoing success is its focus on middle-to-upper-income consumers. People with higher incomes are less likely to alter their spending habits during minor economic disruptions or periods of above-average inflation.\n\nTo add to this point, Williams-Sonoma probably couldn't be in better position to benefit from the current economic climate. With mortgage rates soaring over the last two years, existing homeowners have very little incentive to move. This plays right into the company's hands, with homeowners choosing to remodel or freshen up the look of their home.\n\nBut whether or not Williams-Sonoma stock is still worth buying is up for debate. While it's been cruising past Wall Street's consensus profit expectations for as far back as the eye can see, sales growth has stalled in recent years. Though higher margins and a hearty share repurchase program have given the company's bottom line a nice boost, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17 is about 34% above its trailing-five-year average.\n\nUnless Williams-Sonoma returns to meaningful sales growth relatively soon, squeezing more out of the proverbial orange, even with a stock split on deck, could prove challenging.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Williams-Sonoma right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Williams-Sonoma, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Williams-Sonoma wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Chipotle Stock a Buy After Its Historic Stock Split?",
        "content": "Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) capped an amazing run up in its share price this year with a 50-for-1 stock split in June. It was one of the largest stock splits in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nExplaining why the company did it, CFO Jack Hartung said, \"We believe the stock split will make our stock more accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors.\"\n\nWith its historic stock split complete, is now the time to invest in Chipotle? Here's a look into the company to answer that question.\n\nChipotle's sales success\n\nChipotle's share price has already increased substantially over the past several months, nearly doubling from a 52-week low of $35.37 last October to a high of $69.26 in June. This is a testament to the company's outstanding financial performance.\n\nIn 2023, Chipotle generated $9.9 billion in revenue, a 14% jump from 2022's $8.6 billion. In addition, its net income increased a whopping 37% year over year to $1.2 billion. These results propelled Chipotle's 2023 diluted earnings per share (EPS) to $44.34, a 38% increase from the prior-year's $32.04.\n\nLast year's success continued into 2024. Its first-quarter revenue reached $2.7 billion, representing 14% year-over-year growth, while net income rose 23% to $359.3 million from 2023's $291.6 million. Chipotle's Q1 EPS rose 24% year over year to $13.01.\n\nTo put this performance into context, competitor Yum! Brands, owner of multiple restaurant chains including Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, posted $1.6 billion in sales, $314 million in net income, and an EPS of $1.10 in Q1. Yum! Brands is an interesting rival to compare to because Chipotle's CEO, Brian Niccol, was once the CEO of Taco Bell.\n\nChipotle's sales strategy\n\nNiccol, who took over the CEO spot in 2018, summarized the strategy used to produce Chipotle's excellent financial results when he said, \"Our strong sales trends were fueled by our focus on improving throughput in our restaurants.\"\n\nThis strategy helped Chipotle's Q1 sales in its existing stores achieve a 7% year-over-year increase. Growth in same-store sales is critical to the company's ability to boost revenue, hence the importance in strengthening customer throughput.\n\nChipotle uses various tactics to increase the number of customers it can drive through each location. For example, the restaurant chain makes it easy for customers to place orders online via its website or mobile app. Digital sales accounted for 37% of the company's Q1 food and beverage revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother tactic is Chipotle's coupling of online orders with a new store format called a Chipotlane. A Chipotlane is a drive-through dedicated specifically for customers to pick up online orders.\n\nThis evolution of the traditional drive-through concept makes it quick and easy for customers to get their food, further increasing throughput per location. The Chipotlane was introduced in 2018 under Niccol's tenure.\n\nThe company described the Chipotlane format's success, stating, \"New restaurant openings that feature this digital order pick-up lane have demonstrated higher volumes and greater returns than a traditional Chipotle restaurant format.\" The company expects at least 80% of new stores in 2024 to include a Chipotlane.\n\nDeciding on Chipotle stock\n\nNew store openings is another factor in Chipotle's revenue growth. In Q1, the company opened 47 locations and is targeting a total of at least 285 new restaurants in 2024. Last year, it added 271 stores.\n\nChipotle's goal is to reach 7,000 locations in North America. At the end of Q1, it was about halfway to this goal with nearly 3,500 restaurants.\n\nThanks to the opening of new locations and rising same-store sales, Chipotle's revenue has grown substantially with Niccol at the helm, more than doubling since the start of his tenure. CMG Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nNiccol's leadership, Chipotle's success increasing customer throughput, and its store-expansion plans position the company for sustained revenue growth, which can boost its stock's potential to increase in value. In fact, the current consensus among Wall Street analysts is an overweight rating with a median share price of $67.69 for Chipotle stock.\n\nWith shares down from June's 52-week high after the historic stock split, now is a good time to buy shares in Chipotle.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Here's the Best-Performing Stock-Split Stock of 2024 So Far -- and It Isn't Even Close",
        "content": "According to the Chinese calendar, 2024 is the \"year of the wood dragon.\" For investors, though, this might be the \"year of the stock splits.\" Several major companies have either already conducted stock splits or plan to do so over the next few weeks and months.\n\nHistorically, stocks tend to perform well after announcing stock splits. That's been generally true this year, with one stock delivering especially big gains. Here's the best stock-split stock of 2024 so far -- and it isn't even close.\n\nThe top contenders\n\nWalmart(NYSE: WMT) kicked off the \"year of stock splits\" in January with its announcement of a 3-for-1 split. CEO Doug McMillon said the giant retailer decided to split its shares for the first time since March 1999 to make its stock more affordable for its associates. Walmart conducted the stock split after the market close on Feb. 22, 2024.\n\nIn March, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) announced that its board of directors approved a huge 50-for-1 stock split. A few months later, after winning shareholder approval a few months later, Chipotle conducted its stock split following the market close on June 25.\n\nAmphenol (NYSE: APH) didn't announce its plans to conduct a 2-for-1 stock split until May. However, the electronic components maker beat Chipotle to the punch, conducting its stock split after the market close on June 11.\n\nSeveral other companies intend to split their shares soon. Williams-Sonoma's (NYSE: WSM) 2-for-1 stock split is scheduled for July 8. Chipmaker Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split on July 12. Sony's (NYSE: SONY) 5-for-1 stock split should occur after the market close on Sept. 30. Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX),\u00a0which makes equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors, plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split on Oct. 2.\n\nAll three stocks that have already conducted stock splits have performed well so far this year. Walmart's shares are up nearly 30%. Chipotle and Amphenol stocks have both soared close to 36%.\n\nNearly all the stocks with splits on the way have delivered strong gains as well. Broadcom is the best performer of the group, with its shares vaulting more than 50% higher year to date. Williams-Sonoma stock is up close to 40%. Lam Research isn't far behind, with a year-to-date gain of around 38%. The only lower among these stock-split stocks is Sony, whose shares have fallen close to 10% this year.\n\nThe hands-down winner\n\nHowever, another stock-split stock is the hands-down winner. In its first-quarter update on May 22, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) announced plans for a 10-for-1 stock split. The graphics processing unit (GPU) maker conducted this split after the market close on June 7.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's shares have skyrocketed more than 150% year to date, eclipsing all the other top stocks announcing splits this year. This huge gain comes on top of a 239% gain in 2023.\n\nAlthough Nvidia's share price rose by a double-digit percentage in the days following its stock split, it has retreated since then. The real engine behind Nvidia's spectacular performance this year is the continued strong demand for its GPUs, thanks to a massive generative artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind.\n\nWhich is the best stock-split stock to buy now?\n\nThe old saying that there are \"different strokes for different folks\" applies to which stock-split stock is the best to buy right now. Different investors will likely prefer different stocks based on their investing styles.\n\nIf you're concerned about an economic downturn, Walmart is probably the best pick. The discount retailer is one of the top recession-resistant stocks around.\n\nIncome investors don't have great options with these stock-split stocks. However, Williams-Sonoma offers a forward dividend yield of 1.6% -- the highest yield in the group. It's also neck-and-neck with Sony as the most attractively valued of these stocks.\n\nWhat about growth investors? I think Nvidia and Broadcom are good choices. Broadcom trades at a lower forward earnings multiple, but Nvidia's growth prospects remain exceptionally bright. It's arguably still the best stock-split stock for growth investors to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Everyone needs to eat, but not everyone wants to cook their own food. Even though people can save money by cooking instead of going out to eat, many people regularly visit restaurants. These establishments can offer a sense of community, and they also make food prep less stressful.\n\nA U.S. Foods survey revealed that 76% of people order takeout or delivery because\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s\u00a0more enjoyable to eat at home\u201d\u00a0with takeout. Almost half of people mentioned they prefer to avoid cooking, and many people also cited convenience and socializing.\n\nWhile the restaurant industry can be challenging due to relatively\u00a0low profit\u00a0margins and turnover, the top restaurants can make it big. Some restaurant stocks have comfortably outperformed big tech companies over several years, and they can cook up some serious returns for your portfolio. Wondering which restaurant stocks are worth monitoring? Let\u2019s take a bite out of some of the top restaurant stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecently, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) completed its stock split and is now valued at approximately $61.58 per share. This fast food restaurant chain has comfortably outperformed the stock market with a 39% year-to-date (YTD) gain and a 326% surge over the past five years.\n\nWhile many restaurants have been hit by inflation, Chipotle continues to march ahead despite raising prices for its food multiple times over the past two years. The Mexican Grill chain reported 14.1% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth and 23.2% YOY net income growth in the\u00a0first quarter. Chipotle remains on target for opening 285-315 restaurants this year and wrapped up the first quarter by opening an additional 47 restaurants.\n\nThe restaurant has plenty of staying power and more pricing flexibility than most fast food restaurants due to its emphasis on health. CMG offers some of the healthiest food choices among fast food restaurant chains, and that comes with a premium. So far, the business model has worked out well for long-term investors.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) offers growth at a reasonable price. The steakhouse chain trades at a 35 P/E ratio and offers a 1.40% yield for investors. Shares are up by 46% YTD and have gained 224% over the past five years.\n\nThe company had a strong\u00a0first quarter\u00a0that helped to justify recent gains. Revenue increased by 12.5% YOY\u00a0while\u00a0net income jumped by 31.0% YOY. Comparable sales remained elevated and were 8.4% higher than the same quarter last year. Nine company-owned locations and three franchise restaurants opened in the quarter. Texas Roadhouse has 753 total restaurants (644 company-owned and 109 franchises).\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Texas Roadhouse has plenty of momentum behind it. However, its valuation leaves it less vulnerable to sharp pullbacks than other restaurant stocks that have soared this year.\u00a0The restaurant chain offers affordable meat which\u00a0has attracted many customers.\u00a0High comparable sales growth suggests many customers regularly dine at the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0steakhouse chains.\n\nWingstop (WING) A Wingstop (WING) restaurant storefront in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nWingstop (NASDAQ:WING) has enjoyed a 69% ascent over the past year and is up by 350% over the past five years. The restaurant chain prioritizes buffalo wings and uses decor with a 1930s and 1940s aviation theme across its locations.\n\nFirst quarter results indicate that the company is still growing at a fast rate. Revenue grew by 34.1% YOY\u00a0while net income jumped by 83.5% YOY. Wingstop closed the quarter with a 19.7% net profit margin and opened 65 new restaurants in the quarter.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0even more than Chipotle.\n\nMaking things even better, Wingstop reported 21.6% domestic same stores sales growth. That means many people are visiting Wingstop, becoming returning customers and bringing their friends. It bodes well for long-term investors and makes up for the relatively low 0.21% yield. Granted, Wingstop has a\u00a0double-digit dividend growth rate and has occasionally given out special dividends to its long-term investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in TXRH.

        "content": "This may feel like the dog days of summer, but it also marks a significant event on the investing calendar \u2013 the beginning of the third quarter. Yes, 2024 is halfway done, and if you\u2019re still trying to outperform the market this year, you should look at adding A-rated stocks to your portfolio.\n\nThe ratings come from the Portfolio Grader, a free tool ideal for sorting and screening stocks. To get an \u201cA\u201d rating, a stock must have high grades in factors such as growth, earnings performance, momentum, and analyst sentiment.\n\nAs companies begin the year\u2019s second half, many are reassessing their strategies and goals to hit their full-year numbers. As an investor, you should do the same thing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis has been a good year, so far, for the market, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite showing a 21% gain. The S&P 500 is close behind at 16%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is only showing a 4.3% gain.\n\nSo, as you look at your portfolio for the year\u2019s second half, you should put heavy consideration into tech stocks. You\u2019ll see today\u2019s list of A-rated stocks with a heavy emphasis on tech \u2013 none of which are represented on the Dow 30 list of Dow Jones stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia Corporation logo on smartphone screen. Against stock prices, stock chart. Investments in securities.. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.com\n\nAny company changing life as we know it will get the No. 1 spot on my list of top stocks to buy \u2013 and for several months now, that\u2019s been Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe semiconductor company makes most \u2013 nearly all \u2013 of the high-powered chips needed for complex operations that power machine learning, the Internet of Things, and generative artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia saw revenue in its most recent quarter jump 262% from a year ago to $26 billion, and earnings per share of $6.12 up 629% from last year.\n\nAnd even though logic dictates that this massive growth can\u2019t continue forever \u2013 after all the company is facing some more difficult comparable numbers \u2013 Nvidia continues to roll.\n\nIts H100 processors have led the charge, but Nvidia\u2019s H200 processors work even faster. And the Blackwell platform lets any organization operate large language models with 25 times less cost and energy.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m betting on Nvidia to continue to perform. The stock is up 159% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe home of Facebook, Instagram, Reels, WhatsApp and Messenger, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has a massive audience of users who use the social media platforms to connect with friends, family and to make new connections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s a winning formula for Meta, because all that sharing gives Meta an enormous amount of information about its customers likes, dislikes, hobbies, political affiliations and spending habits \u2013 all information that advertisers can use to directly target customers with ads.\n\nMeta got 98% of its revenue in the first quarter from advertising. Bringing in $36.4 billion, up 23% from a year ago. Earnings per share was $4.71, up from $2.20 per share in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nMeta is also deeply involved with artificial intelligence with Meta AI, a large language model that can do everything from creating images and animated custom GIFs to suggest a dinner menu based on what ingredients you have on hand.\n\nMeta\u2019s Q2 earnings report is slated for July 31. If it continues to grow revenue and daily average users, the stock will have a massive summer.\n\nMETA stock is up 44% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is an amazing fast-casual restaurant stock. The company perfectly positioned itself as an alternative to a slew of burger joints by offering custom-made burritos and burrito bowls consisting of fresh ingredients \u2013 nothing is ever frozen.\n\nThat\u2019s why Chipotle grew to over 3,400 locations. And unlike many other chains, Chipotle doesn\u2019t sell franchises. All of its locations are owned and operated by the company, so Chipotle can do a better job in maintaining quality and standards.\n\nAnd if you thought Chipotle stock was too expensive to buy without fractional shares, think again. The company in late June executed a 50-for-1 stock split so shares of CMG stock are just over $60.\n\nThat makes them far more accessible to retail investors and it\u2019s much easier to make options trades with CMG stock as well.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up 14.1% from a year ago. Comparable restaurant sales were up 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%.\n\nChipotle stock is up 34% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe massive advances in generative AI and large language models has been a tailwind for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), also known as Supermicro.\n\nThe company provides the custom server infrastructure that allows customers to bundle their GPUs and perform AI functions.\n\nThe company has a close relationship with Nvidia as its preferred server partner. And it also has a customer-friendly business model because its servers are like building blocks \u2013 parts can be easily swapped out and upgraded rather than a customer replacing the entire thing.\n\nEarnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 included sales of $3.85 billion, up from $1.28 billion a year ago. Income was $402 million and $6.56 per share versus $86 million and $1.53 per share last year.\n\nSMCI stock is down from all-time highs hit in March, but the stock still gained 197% in 2024 and maintains its \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith more of our business, banking and personal information on computers these days, there\u2019s much more of a need for companies like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD).\n\nCrowdStrike is a computer security company that operates a cloud-native platform that provides endpoint protection, cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform is powered by AI and machine learning to respond to and stop threats in real time. The company also sells modules, which are extensions that customers can add to customize their platforms and increase protection.\n\nModules include endpoint security, data security, IT operations, threat intelligence and more.\n\nCrowdStrike says 65% of its customers purchase and use at least five modules, making it a lucrative business model.\n\nRevenue for the company\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $921 million, up 33% from a year ago. Subscription revenue was $872.2 million, up 34% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nCRWD stock is up 51% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the king of streaming services, ranking No. 1 as the biggest paid-for streaming company on the planet (it trails only YouTube, which is free to watch and ad-free with a premium subscription).\n\nNetflix currently has 269.6 million paid subscribers \u2013 a number that increased dramatically last year when the company dumped its longtime password-sharing program and began charging customers an $8 surcharge to grant access to an account outside of the household.\n\nThe decision was controversial with customers, but wildly effective. Paid memberships are up from 232.6 million a year ago because people find value in Netflix\u2019s content.\n\nRevenue of $9.3 billion in the first quarter was up 14.8% from a year ago, and Netflix forecast additional growth to $9.49 billion when it reports Q2 earnings in mid-July.\n\nNFLX stock is up 40% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) proves that you don\u2019t have to be a tech company to be an A-rated stock.\n\nThe California-based company sells kitchenware and home furnishings, operating under the brands that include Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm.\n\nIn addition to retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K., Williams-Sonoma franchises brands to third parties that operate in the Middle East, Mexico and the Philippines.\n\nThe company is also in the process of a 2-for-1 stock split. Shareholders as of June 27 will receive the split through a stock dividend that will be issued on July 8; shares will then start trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 9.\n\nBut if you missed the split, there\u2019s still plenty of reasons to have WSM stock. The company saw revenues drop in the first quarter to $1.66 billion from $1.75 billion a year ago.\n\nBut it was also more efficient, with profits of $802 million up from $675 million; net earnings of $265.6 million versus $156.5 million a year ago, and earnings per share of $4.07 versus $2.35 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nWSM stock is up 39% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had LONG position(s) in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.\u00a0Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had a LONG position in NVDA.

        "title": "The Three Best Consumer Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Consumer-centric companies are generally volatile buys for the long term. While consumer spending is a big focus in the U.S. because it is a great macroeconomic indicator, several factors impact it. These factors include job stability, inflation, income, interest rates and taxes. The state of the economy, as well as the confidence people have in it, are big factors as well.\n\nAlthough real wages have been reduced recently, with inflation coming off of all-time highs, consumer spending is expected to increase. Additionally, with summer on the way, spending in home improvement stores will increase, because consumers try to take on home-improvement passion projects when the weather\u2019s nice.\n\nRegardless, the three companies selected today have great financials, as well as great growth potential regardless of the time of year. As I said, with consumer spending forecast to increase, now is the perfect time to invest in these three consumer stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is an internationally known wholesale-style superstore. It provides consumers the option to purchase goods in higher quantities than regular stores, thereby increasing the money they save. It also has Costco Business Centers, which are stores that cater to businesses. However, their main focus is consumer sales.\n\nCOST\u2019s financials are great. While its profit and operating margins are low (2.83% and 3.76%, respectively), this isn\u2019t a matter of concern. The bulk of its profits come from the sales of memberships, as it is a member-only chain. This is somewhat reflected in year-on-year quarterly revenue and earnings growth. COST revenue grew by 9.1%, while earnings grew by 29.1% in the same period. Additionally, a beta of 0.77 indicates that this company is a stable pick.\n\nThe company is well-known for the use of loss leaders, such as the $5 rotisserie chicken and $1.50 hot dog-and-soda combo meal. These deals get consumers in the door after which they are more likely to spend more than planned. This has played a part in its growth with same-store sales up 7% this quarter. This has become a popular meme on social media, with multiple accounts making fun of this. Yet COST also has a loyal fanbase, and at the moment, has no serious risks, making it a buy.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is among the best-known Mexican fast-casual chains in the U.S. It also operates internationally, with stores in Canada and Europe. The U.S., though remains its largest market. After its 50-to-1 stock split, the stock corrected by 10%, making it the perfect time to jump in.\n\nStory continues\n\nCMG stock is trading at $61.58 with a market valuation of $84.57 billion. The company\u2019s financials and growth are solid with revenue and earnings increasing by considerable amounts. CMG has a profit margin of 12.70% with an operating margin of 16.54%. It also has a return on equity of 44.37%, indicating management\u2019s effectiveness. While quarterly revenue and earnings are up 14.1% and 23.2% year-over-year, the company has come under fire recently. Reduced portion sizes have led to customers boycotting the brand or simply walking out mid-order. This represents a serious risk for the chain, especially as this reputation becomes more well-known but management is taking steps to counter this development.\n\nRegardless, analysts are predicting stock price growth of 7.5% for the rest of this year, indicating its shares are likely to continue growing, making it a buy.\n\nHome Depot (HD) a Home Depot store is seen from the outside\n\nSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) provides consumers access to home-improvement goods. While its main market is the U.S., it also operates internationally. The range of products offered is vast, from garage doors to toilets. It also serves construction workers, carpenters or any other professional engaged in building and home improvement services.\n\nThe company has a solid profit and operating margin sitting at 9.79% and 13.95%, respectively. This is likely due to its bare-bones design. Like Costco, the store is the warehouse itself. Management effectiveness is off the charts with Yahoo Finance reporting a return on equity of 1,362.97%. While revenue and earnings have fallen slightly this quarter, this dip isn\u2019t indicative of a long-term trend.\n\nA hike in its dividend by management puts focus on the company\u2019s cash flow and is indicative of a bullish future. Analysts are predicting share price growth of 14.88% through the remainder of this year. While the company does have competition from stores like Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW), recent moves such as the acquisition of SRS Distribution make the stock a worthy buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG): Why Are Analysts Bullish On This Restaurant Stock Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) stands against the other restaurant stocks.\n\nCurrently, quite a bit of anxiety is struck by restaurant stocks in the market, as the Russell index that tracks restaurants experienced a 6% fall since March 2024. Other sectors, like industrials, and materials, to name a few, are experiencing a similar struggle as restaurants. This situation, as a whole, is indicative of potential late-cycle market issues marked by the market\u2019s slow growth in general, which is driven by consumer distress in the U.S. in a larger sense.\n\nMoreover, amidst this inflation-stricken market, restaurants in the U.S. are in quite a bit of a meal deal war, hoping to fulfill the customers\u2019 need for affordability. As such, Sonic, a drive-in fast-food chain headquartered in Oklahoma, U.S., is the newest member to join the war, as it has introduced a $1.99 value menu, boasting a selection of various food items.\n\nPreviously, Taco Bell and Burger King have already introduced their discounted meal deals, showcasing various brands\u2019 dire attempts to attract customers in the given circumstances. Moreover, this is also driven by increased food and wage costs in the market, pushing down the margins of various restaurant brands, according to analysts. The Consumer Price Index has risen at a cumulative rate of 20.8% since February 2020, as reported by Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Thus, this explains why restaurant ETFs and stocks have started off the third quarter on a lower note.\n\nNevertheless, there\u2019s bright hope as the global fast food, which goes hand-in-hand with the restaurant industry, is set to grow at a CAGR of 3.7% from 2023 to 2032, expected to reach $1 trillion by then. Furthermore, one can keep their hopes high, as it is reported that a staggering 37% of the U.S. population is a consumer of fast food. For the fast-food market, the millennial segment is one that it must rely on the most, as 54% of this segment steps toward fast-food chains once or twice every week. You can check out our article about the 20 Fast Food Chains with Most Locations in the World.\n\nOn the other hand, according to the National Restaurant Association, the U.S. restaurant industry is forecasted to result in $1.1 trillion worth of sales in the year 2024. This will translate into the employment of 15.7 million Americans. However, amidst the supply chain inefficiencies and rising costs, it would be challenging for restaurant operators to make profits, and technology is expected to play a decisive role in determining the winners and losers of the market in the coming time, according to market analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, it\u2019s essential to know where to put your money, when it comes to the restaurant market. Hence, now we will take you to our list of 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Today.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Today, we gathered a list of all companies with a significant presence in the restaurant industry. We then further narrowed down the list based on the companies\u2019 respective upside potential and ranked the finest remaining companies by their number of hedge fund holders as of Q1, 2024, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database that tracks the activity of 920 hedge funds. For stocks with an equal number of hedge fund holders, we used their upside as the tiebreaker. Plus, note that all the stock prices quoted are as of writing this article unless otherwise stated.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA chef plating up a wide variety of dishes for a restaurant chain.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nServing mouth-watering tacos and burritos, along with many other food items, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is an operator of 3,200 fast-casual restaurants.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:CMG) stock has gained popularity in the investors\u2019 eyes, as the number of hedge fund holdings increased from 56 in Q4 2023 to 60 in Q1 2024, taking the total invested value to a massive $5.13 billion! This is on the back of an upside potential that the stock is carrying, which equals a decent 8.74%.\n\nMoreover, the analysts expected the company\u2019s EPS for Q1 2024 to be $11.68, whereas it recorded an EPS of $13.37! Moreover, 47 new brand outlets opened up during the quarter, resulting in a traffic increase of 5.4%. This helped the company bag a net income of $359.3 million, which was an increase as compared to $291.6, a year ago. Moreover, around 300 new locations are planned to open up in the whole year 2024, which will improve the profitability of the company over the coming quarters. Having said this, we think TXRH is more attractively priced than CMG because Chipotle increased its revenues by only 60% since 2020 as opposed to more than 100% for TXRH and trade at a forward P/E of 56 vs. half of that amount for TXRH.\n\nOverall CMG ranks 3rd on our list of the best restaurant stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Restaurant Stocks to Buy Todayto see the other restaurant stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of CMG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG has demonstrated resilience amid market volatility, providing substantial returns to investors. The stock has notably outperformed its industry peers and the broader S&P 500 index.\r\n\r\nThis success is driven by robust same-store sales growth, digitalization efforts, expansion initiatives and effective advertising strategies. Additionally, the company has been benefiting from increased transaction growth.\r\n\r\nChipotle\u2019s stock has surged 34.6% year to date, in stark contrast to the industry's 7.4% decline. As of Jul 3, the stock closed at $61.58, which is below its 52-week high of $69.26 but significantly higher than its 52-week low of $35.37.\n\nStock Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nChipotle\u2019s Growth Drivers\n\nRobust Comps\n\nImpressive comps performance continues to drive growth. During the first quarter of 2024, comparable restaurant sales increased 7% year over year, following growth of 8.4% (in fourth quarter 2023), 5% (in third-quarter 2023), 7.4% (in second-quarter 2023) and 10.9% (in first-quarter 2023). The consistent performance can be largely attributed to increased transactions and higher average checks. These, along with robust digital sales and a strong recovery in in-store sales, bolstered the company\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nFor the second quarter of 2024, the company anticipates comparable sales to benefit from an extra day due to Easter. For 2024, Chipotle anticipates comps growth in the mid to high single-digit range, driven by its transaction growth and strong comps growth trends.\n\nStrengthening Digital Capabilities\n\nChipotle is intensifying its efforts to expand its digital initiatives as a cornerstone of its growth strategy. The company is enhancing the appeal and efficiency of digital ordering for customers and restaurants alike. This includes redesigning and streamlining its online ordering platform, introducing online payment options for catering and customizable meals, and partnering with established third-party providers for delivery services.\u00a0 Also, there has been a significant increase in digital orders and guest satisfaction since the rollout of its \u201cSmarter Pickup Times\u201d technology.\r\n\r\nThe resultant improvement in guest access and convenience, as well as the contribution from Chipotlanes, increased digital sales contribution in the first quarter to 36.5%. The company focuses on improving order accuracy and timing for its digital business.\n\nProduct Branding\n\nChipotle's emphasis on advertising initiatives is proving successful. The marketing team has effectively increased the brand's visibility, relevance and popularity. In the first quarter of 2024, the company launched promotions to bring barbacoa under the spotlight, following consumer insights that revealed a lack of awareness about it. Thus, it rebranded it as Braised Beef Barbacoa, highlighting its slow-cooked, responsibly prepared beef seasoned with garlic and cumin and hand-shredded. The campaign yielded positive results, driving increased transactions and spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong Liquidity\n\nChipotle's robust balance sheet positions the company well to navigate the current economic environment.\u00a0 As of Mar 31, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $727.4 million compared with $560.6 million as of Dec 31, 2023. At the end of the first quarter of 2024, the company stated that it had no debt, which reflected its strong financial position.\n\nCMG Estimate Movement\n\nEstimates for CMG\u2019s 2024 earnings have moved up from $1.10 to $1.11 over the past 60 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat May Hinder the Stock's Momentum?\n\nLike other industry players, the company has been facing wage inflation and higher costs across most commodities and categories. Beef and produce inflation and a challenge in protein mix resulting from the Braised Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative drove costs higher.\r\n\r\nFor second-quarter 2024, the company anticipates the cost of sales to be in the mid 29% range owing to higher costs across several line items, most notably avocados. For the quarter, the company anticipates its labor expenses to remain around the mid-24% range, with wage inflation increasing to approximately 6% due to the minimum wage hike in California. For 2024, the cost of sales is expected to be in the low to mid-single-digit range.\r\n\r\nFrom the valuation point of view, the stock is trading at a premium. Chipotle\u2019s forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio stands at 50.5, significantly higher than the industry\u2019s ratio of 22.07 and the S&P 500's ratio of 21.50. This suggests that investors may be paying a high price relative to the company's expected earnings growth. The company is also trading currently at a premium compared to other industry players like Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI, Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ and Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR.\n\nConclusion\n\nChipotle is poised to benefit from robust digitalization, strategic initiatives and strong financial fundamentals in the long run. However, economic headwinds persist. Additionally, Chipotle's stock has pulled back over the past month and is now trading below its 50-day moving average.\n\nExisting stakeholders should maintain their position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, while potential new investors may want to wait for a better entry point, given the stock's stretched valuation.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Stock Split Is Over for Chipotle Mexican Grill and Shares Have Quickly Dropped More Than 10%. What It Means for Investors.",
        "content": "On June 26, restaurant company Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) did a 50-for-1 stock split -- one of the largest splits investors have ever seen. Anyone who owned just two shares of the company before now owns 100, thanks to this highly publicized event.\n\nHowever, Chipotle stock is down about 11% from the all-time high that it reached back in June, with much of the drop happening after the stock split. In fact, it's the largest pullback for Chipotle stock in almost a year.\n\nI have reason to believe that some Chipotle shareholders bought the stock entirely because of the stock split. A 2023 study published by the Journal of Risk and Financial Management found that a stock's trading volume usually increases with a stock-split announcement. And the trading volume generally goes up enough after a split that it's reasonable to assume that there are more shareholders after the split than there were before.\n\nTherefore, I believe some investors own Chipotle stock because it just did a huge 50-for-1 split. And these investors are likely upset to already be down sharply.\n\nWhy isn't Chipotle stock surging after the split?\n\nThe true value of a company isn't found in its stock price, but rather in its market capitalization. Each share represents a small, fractional ownership piece of the business. The market cap adds up the price of all the shares outstanding to arrive at the entire worth of the company.\n\nLet's assume that two different stocks both traded at $10 per share. If the first company had 1 million shares and the second company had 1 billion shares, the former would have a market cap of only $10 million whereas the other would have a market cap of $10 billion. In other words, the stock prices would be the same. But one company would be worth 1,000 times more than the other because it would have 1,000 times as many shares.\n\nWhen Chipotle split its stock, it instantly had 50 times as many shares as before. But it didn't do anything to create shareholder value nor was any value lost. This is because the stock price was also instantly about 1/50th what is was before. In other words, it was all a wash from a market-cap value perspective.\n\nIt may not have created any shareholder value with the stock split but Chipotle did create plenty of buzz. From the time the split was announced through when the split actually happened, Chipotle stock outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin -- investors were clearly excited. CMG Chart\n\nNow that Chipotle's stock split is in the past, excitement is ebbing, which has led to the lower stock price.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat to do now\n\nDon't misunderstand: It was never a foregone conclusion that Chipotle stock would rise with the announcement of the split and then fall afterward. Investor sentiment can drive stock prices in any direction over the short term and sentiment is intrinsically unpredictable.\n\nThe actionable takeaway from all of this for investors is that there are things that can drive a stock's price over the short term. But sometimes these are things that don't actually create value, such as with stock splits. Therefore, these aren't things that should demand any focus.\n\nRather, investors in Chipotle (and other stocks) should develop an investment thesis -- a pithy explanation of how a company can create value in coming years. While an investment thesis plays out, market sentiment will rise and fall, creating volatility with a stock price. But those who calmly hold through the volatility can be rewarded with big gains.\n\nOver the long term, weightier matters such as revenue growth and profit margin improvements have a much greater impact on a stock's price than a split. And because this is true, long-term investors need to focus on those things.\n\nFor Chipotle shareholders who only bought shares because of the stock split, I'd say that you have more research to do before deciding whether this is a stock that you want to own for the long term. But allow me to give you a head start by explaining why the company can at least increase its revenue.\n\nChipotle owns all of its U.S. restaurants and it had almost 3,500 as of the end of its first quarter of 2024. However, in coming years, it plans to open hundreds of additional locations. Because these will also be owned by the company, it's likely that the company's revenue will meaningfully grow. And revenue growth is one of the most important things for a winning stock.\n\nFor Chipotle shareholders who do have an investment thesis that's unrelated from the stock split, be encouraged that nothing has fundamentally changed with the business. The stock is just down as sentiment adjusts like it always does.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Andrew Carnegie is credited as saying, \"The way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket.\"\n\nBill Ackman has amassed a net worth of over $9 billion by following a modified version of the strategy. All his Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund's assets are currently invested in only eight stocks -- two of which are different classes of shares for the same company.\n\nDespite having a small number of holdings, Ackman has several big winners this year. Here are the billionaire hedge fund manager's best-performing stocks of 2024 so far.\n\n1. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) ranks as Ackman's top stock of the year. Shares of the restaurant chain operator are up nearly 34% year to date after soaring 65% in 2023.\n\nAckman reduced Pershing Square's position in Chipotle by 9.8% in the first quarter. However, it remained the hedge fund's largest single holding at the end of the quarter, making up over 20% of Pershing Square's total portfolio.\n\nOne key factor behind Chipotle's strong performance so far in 2024 is the company's solid growth. The company reported Q1 revenue jumped 14% year over year to $2.7 billion, and its adjusted earnings per share soared 27% to $13.37.\n\nChipotle also generated excitement in March when it announced a 50-for-1 stock split. The company conducted this big split after the market close on June 25, 2024.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) trails slightly behind Chipotle as Ackman's second-best performer so far in 2024. The tech giant's shares have vaulted 31% higher this year.\n\nPershing Square owns both Alphabet's class A and class C shares. At the end of Q1, they made up 6.1% and 13.3%, respectively, of the hedge fund's total portfolio.\n\nThe generative AI boom has provided a nice tailwind for Alphabet's Google Cloud business. In Q1, the unit's revenue increased more than 28% to $9.6 billion.\n\nMost of Alphabet's revenue, though, is generated from its other operations -- primarily Google Search and YouTube. These businesses also continue to perform well, with total Google Services revenue rising nearly 14% year over year in Q1 to $70.4 billion.\n\n3. Hilton Worldwide Holdings\n\nAckman's No. 3 stock of 2024, with less than six months remaining in the year, might be surprising. Shares of hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings(NYSE: HLT) are up 18% year to date.\n\nTechnically, Hilton was Pershing Square's second-largest holding at the end of Q1. However, with the class A and class C shares of Alphabet combined, it would have been the hedge fund's third-largest position.\n\nStory continues\n\nHilton's revenue increased 12% year over year in Q1 to $2.3 billion. Its earnings jumped nearly 29% higher to $265 million, or $1.04 per diluted share.\n\nAre they still buys?\n\nI'd be leery of buying Chipotle after the stock's impressive run. The Mexican restaurant chain's shares trade at a sky-high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 56.8. That lofty level is hard to justify with Chipotle's growth.\n\nHilton Worldwide Holdings also appears to be a bit pricey. Its forward earnings multiple is 30.3. Again, I don't think Hilton's growth prospects warrant this valuation.\n\nThat leaves Alphabet. It isn't cheap, either, with shares trading at 24.3 times forward earnings. Some investors could be worried that artificial intelligence (AI) presents an existential threat to the company's search business.\n\nHowever, Ackman said last year that Alphabet \"will be a dominant player in AI for the very, very long term.\" I agree with his take. I like the opportunities for Google Cloud and the Waymo self-driving car technology business. Of Ackman's three biggest winners of 2024 so far, Alphabet is the best pick for long-term investors, in my view.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The 7 Best Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "The first half of the trading year is in the books, and by all accounts, it was a resounding success. The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 15% from January through the end of June, hitting all-time highs on 31 separate occasions. Market analyst Charlie Bilello notes that, at 5,460, the S&P 500 ended the first half of 2024 above every single year-end price target on Wall Street.\n\nThe takeaway is that this market has defied expectations and in a big way. While it\u2019s hard to know where the market will go in the year\u2019s second half, some stocks look like good bets as we head into July. A number of stocks are benefitting from positive catalysts and appear to have momentum as we make our way through the summer months and the year\u2019s third quarter. Here are the seven best stocks to buy in July 2024.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) The front of a Rivian (RIVN) storefront is seen lined up with Rivian R1T and R1S model trucks out in front.\n\nSource: Michael Berlfein / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) are in full recovery mode after it was announced that German automotive giant Volkswagen (ETR:VOW3) is investing $5 billion in the electric vehicle start-up company. Volkswagen\u2019s investment includes an initial injection of $1 billion. The additional $4 billion will be allocated to Rivian in stages through 2026. The investment creates a joint venture between VW and Rivian to see the two automakers work on electrical architecture and software technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShares of Rivian soared 35% on news of the Volkswagen investment. The cash infusion from Volkswagen could not have come at a better time, as Rivian\u2019s stock had been under pressure this year due to the company\u2019s cash burn and mounting losses. The electric vehicle maker reported a net loss of $1.45 billion in the first quarter of 2024. While RIVN stock is now on the rise, it remains down 30% this year, suggesting that there is an opportunity for investors to take a stake and ride the share price higher.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor the first time, E-commerce giant Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) market capitalization has just surpassed $2 trillion. The company achieved the milestone as its stock finished trading on June 26 at $193.61 per share. Since then, AMZN stock has risen further, nearly above $200 a share. The company\u2019s stock has increased more than 30% this year, with analysts seeing more upside ahead and rating the stock as a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock has been rising due to strong first-quarter financial results that showed the company\u2019s dominant cloud computing business was recovering after businesses cut back their spending during the pandemic. Earnings and share price are also benefitting from cost-cutting initiatives undertaken over the last two years. It has taken Amazon four years to go from a $1 trillion market valuation to $2 trillion. The median price target on the stock suggests a further 12% upside from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nFederal Express (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nA turnaround in FedEx\u2019s stock (NYSE:FDX) also looks to be underway after the shipping and logistics company reported financial results that beat analyst forecasts and raised its forward guidance. FDX stock has gained 20% in the past month after the company announced EPS of $5.41 versus the $5.35 that was expected. Revenue totaled $22.11 billion compared to $22.07 billion that was estimated on Wall Street.\n\nThe strong results at FedEx come as the company implements cost-cutting measures as part of a plan to save $4 billion by the end of the 2025 fiscal year. Regarding guidance, FedEx raised the outlook for its current year, saying it expects low to mid-single-digit revenue growth mainly driven by e-commerce. Also in June, FedEx raised its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by 10%, taking the distribution to $1.38 per share and giving the stock a yield of 1.85%.\n\nFDX stock is up 18% this year.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building. NVO stock\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow would be an opportune time to take a position in pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) after the company\u2019s popular weight loss drug \u201cWegovy\u201d was approved for use in China, the world\u2019s second largest economy with a population of 1.4 billion people. China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration has approved the weekly injectable drug, noting that half of China\u2019s population is considered overweight.\n\nWegovy will initially be available to people in China with a body mass index indicating obesity. Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic diabetes medication was approved for use in China in 2021, and that drug\u2019s sales doubled in the country last year. Novo Nordisk struggled to keep up with the surging demand for its weight loss drugs before China\u2019s approval. To help ensure it can meet future demand, Novo Nordisk has announced that it is spending $4.1 billion to expand its manufacturing capacity in the U.S.\n\nNVO stock has risen 40% in 2024 and is up 80% over the last 12 months.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) have pulled back 7% since the company enacted a 50-for-1 stock split on June 26. Investors may want to take advantage and buy the dip in this leading restaurant stock. The recent stock split was the first ever for Chipotle and lowered the share price from over $3,200 to less than $65. With the post-split decline, CMG stock trades around $61 per share.\n\nThis is the most affordable Chipotle stock in more than a decade, and the current pullback is unlikely to last long. CMG stock has been a long-term winner, having risen more than 300% in the last five years. The company has consistently posted strong same-store sales and grown its retail network. In this year\u2019s first quarter, Chipotle reported that its sales rose 14% year-over-year while its net income increased 20%.\n\nHeico (HEI) The website for Heico is shown with a magnifying glass enlarging the company's logo.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAircraft parts manufacturer Heico (NYSE:HEI) has raised its dividend payment by 10%. In the future, the Hollywood, Florida-based company will pay a distribution of 11 cents per share, up from 10 cents a share previously. Heico pays its dividend to shareholders semi-annually (twice a year). The new dividend will be paid on July 15. Heico has consistently paid its semi-annual dividend since 1979.\n\nThe dividend hike comes as the company\u2019s stock has been on an upswing. Heico, which primarily makes replacement parts for commercial and military aircraft in the U.S., has seen its share price increase 25% since the beginning of 2024. The company also manufactures some medical and telecommunications equipment, though aircraft parts are its main business. Strong earnings and a near monopoly over commercial aircraft components have increased HEI stock.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIs oil producer Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) one of July\u2019s best stocks to buy? Warren Buffett seems to think so. Buffett\u2019s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), continues buying OXY stock. In mid-June, Berkshire bought Occidental Petroleum shares for nine consecutive days, pushing his ownership stake to nearly 30%. Buffett now owns more than 255 million shares of OXY stock worth just under $16 billion.\n\nBuffett buys more stock every time the share price falls below $60. With OXY stock down 13% from its 52-week high of $71.18 in April, Buffett has been buying hand over fist. Beyond Buffett, now is also a good time to purchase Occidental Petroleum stock as crude oil prices rise along with summer demand. West Texas Intermediate (NYSE:WTI) crude oil, the U.S. standard, is trading at $83 a barrel, up from less than $75 per barrel this spring. Some analysts see crude prices topping $90 this year.\n\nOXY stock has risen 5% over the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks that Should Follow Nvidia and Go for the Split",
        "content": "Stock splits are popular once again. In June, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) split its stock on a 10-for-1 basis and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) executed a 50-for-1 split, the first in the restaurant chain\u2019s history. Even Walmart (NYSE:WMT) split its stock on a 3-for-1 basis earlier this year.\n\nOther companies that have announced upcoming stock splits include chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which is splitting its stock 10-for-1 in July, and Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), the furniture retailer that is splitting its stock by half in coming weeks. The reasons stock splits are popular is that they make the shares more affordable for retail investors.\n\nWhile it is true that stock splits don\u2019t change the underlying fundamentals or valuation of a stock, they can make them more widely available to individual investors. Before Chipotle split its stock, an investor with $3,000 couldn\u2019t buy a single share of the restaurant chain. After the split, Chipotle\u2019s stock can be purchased for $60 per share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three stocks that should follow Nvidia and go for the split.\n\nFair Isaac Corp. (FICO) a pile of credit cards, credit card interest rates\n\nSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.com\n\nFair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO) is the company behind everybody\u2019s credit or \u201cFICO\u201d score. The company has been a going concern since 1956 and has a virtual monopoly on credit scoring services in the U.S.\n\nThis has made Fair Isaac a very good stock to own. Over the last 12 months, FICO stock has risen 93%, lifting the share price to just over $1,500. That\u2019s pricey for most investors and makes Fair Isaac a good candidate for a stock split.\n\nTo date, Fair Isaac has split its stock a total of four times. However, the company hasn\u2019t split its stock in 20 years.\n\nAll four previous stock splits occurred in the 10 years between 1995 and 2004. Given the length of time since the last split and the lofty price at which FICO stock currently trades, it is reasonable to assume that Fair Isaac could announce a split along with its next earnings report that\u2019s scheduled for August 7.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nAnother stock that has enjoyed a strong rally over the last year is Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK), the shoemaker behind Hoka runners and Ugg boots.\n\nOver the past 12 months, DECK stock has gained 79%. The rally has pushed the company\u2019s share price up to about $949. While that\u2019s down about 15% from the stock\u2019s 52-week high, it is still quite high, especially for a blue-chip retailer such as Deckers Outdoor. Rival Nike\u2019s (NYSE:NKE) stock is trading right now at about $75 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe high share price makes Deckers Outdoor a good bet for a stock split in the not-too-distant future. DECK stock has been driven higher by quarterly financial results that have run circles around Wall Street forecasts. Deckers most recently announced first-quarter EPS of $4.95, crushing consensus estimates that called for $2.90. Revenue totaled $959.8 million, beating estimates of $885.04 million.\n\nThe company has achieved consistent double-digit revenue growth over the last four years and a more than threefold increase in its earnings per share. That growth shows no signs of letting up anytime soon. Deckers has only split its stock once before, on a 3-for-1 basis back in 2010.\n\nAutoZone (AZO) An AutoZone (AZO) storefront in Saint Augustine, Florida.\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a really expensive stock, look to AutoZone (NYSE:AZO). The retailer of automotive parts and supplies has a stock that is currently trading at about $2,863 per share. That\u2019s prohibitively expensive for many investors, though the stock\u2019s 52-week high is above $3,250 a share.\n\nGiven the sticker shock involved with its share price, many analysts are screaming for the company to split its stock.\n\nAutoZone has previously split its stock twice, with the most recent split occurring on a two-for-one basis back in 1994. In the 20 years since its last stock split, AutoZone has performed extremely well, with strong earnings pushing the share price up 150% over the last five years, including a 14% gain in the past 12 months.\n\nWhile impressive, the company\u2019s long-term success has made its stock quite unaffordable at current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA, FICO and DECK. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) has rewarded shareholders handsomely over the years. Long-term holders have seen their wealth grow nicely with market-beating returns. In the last decade, the stock gained over 423% versus a 235% return for the S&P 500.\n\nClearly, the business has been operating well in the competitive restaurant industry. Can the company maintain its competitive edge and continue producing strong shareholder returns? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSpeedy and fresh\n\nChipotle offers Mexican food at affordable prices. Unlike many fast food chains, it uses fresh, higher-quality ingredients that don't have artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives. That gives it a distinct advantage over competitors like Yum Brands' Taco Bell.\n\nThe concept continues to draw people. First-quarter revenue was up 14.1%, but this was helped by a higher number of restaurants. Same-store sales (comps) provide a better measure, since it's the change for restaurants open at least 13 months. Hence, it's an apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nChipotle's comps increased a strong 7%. Better still, most of the gain, 5.4 percentage points, came from higher traffic rather than increased prices. The balance came from a higher check. Management remains optimistic. It expects a mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase in comps this year.\n\nThe restaurant chain is growing its profit, too. First-quarter earnings per diluted share rose 23.9% to $13.01.\n\nExpansion opportunities\n\nChipotle began humbly more than 30 years ago. It started with a single location in Denver, Colorado, and has grown to nearly 3,500 restaurants, with just 68 located internationally.\n\nThat leaves room for further domestic and international expansion. During the first three months of the year, Chipotle added 47 new restaurants. Management plans to open 285 to 315 locations this year.\n\nMost of its new restaurants include Chipotlane, its drive-through service for digital orders. This allows customers to order via mobile devices, allowing for quicker and more convenient service. Digital sales have become a meaningful portion of Chipotle's revenue, representing 36.5% of the company's first-quarter top line.\n\nThe decision\n\nNaturally, the company's success isn't a secret to investors, and the stock has a high valuation versus the overall market. Chipotle's shares have a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67, up from under 60 a year ago. In comparison, the S&P 500 has a P/E of 28.\n\nIt's hard to jump in when the shares sell at a high multiple. Any disappointment will likely see the shares fall sharply. But with the company filling a need for convenient, reasonably priced food with better ingredients than fast food chains, Chipotle's growth prospects remain bright.\n\nStory continues\n\nRather than committing a large sum at this high valuation, I'd recommend buying shares over time. You can do that via dollar-cost averaging. This requires some discipline since you're committing to investing the same dollar amount at regular intervals. However, it will smooth out your purchase prices, and you'll build up a sizable number of Chipotle shares over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "You don\u2019t have to shell out big bucks to buy quality stocks. There are a lot of great stocks available to buy for less than $50. In fact many companies are actively splitting their stocks to make them more affordable to retail investors. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), for example, just split its stock 50-to-1, taking the share price down to $60 from more than $3,200.\n\nA lot of other stocks do not need to split for the share price to be affordable. There are plenty of great companies that have stocks trading at reasonable prices. A lot of these stocks also offer cheap valuations and big dividend yields, making them even more attractive to average investors. Here are the three best stocks under $50 to buy in July 2024.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nThe stock of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is having a moment in the spotlight. In the past month, HPE stock has gained 18% after the information technology company posted strong financial results. HP Enterprise, as the company is known, reported EPS of 42 cents, which beat the consensus expectation among analysts of 39 cents. Revenue came in at $7.20 billion, topping the $6.80 billion forecast on Wall Street.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt was the company\u2019s best earnings print in two years and has lit a spark under the share price. Best of all, management attributed the strong results to rising demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) servers, which seemed to be exactly what investors wanted to hear from HP Enterprise. Executives said that the AI systems revenue at HP Enterprise more than doubled sequentially in the quarter to $900 million.\n\nHPE stock is now up 25% on the year but still trading for only $21 a share. Investors looking for the best stocks under $50 should consider this technology company.\n\nBank of America (BAC) An image of two ATM machines with the Bank of America logo being displayed above them.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is also on an upswing. The second largest lender in the U.S. has seen its share price rise 37% over the last 12 months, including an 18% gain so far this year. BAC stock has been growing due to a combination of factors that include strong earnings, a resilient economy, and expectations for lower interest rates. Despite its impressive run, Bank of America stock is changing hands at $40 a share.\n\nFor this year\u2019s first quarter, Bank of America reported better-than-expected results due largely to higher interest income and a rebound in investment banking activity. Specifically, investment banking revenue jumped 35% to $1.57 billion as deals continue to return to Wall Street after the 2022 bear market. Also, Bank of America said that its trading business turned in its best first quarter in more than a decade as the stock market boomed.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith so many things working in its favor, now would be a great time to buy BAC stock.\n\nFord Motor Co. (F) Ford logo badge on grill of car\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a really affordable stock, consider the Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F). The Detroit automaker\u2019s shares are currently trading for less than $13 a share. The stock is down 16% over the last 12 months due to issues ranging from last fall\u2019s costly strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, mixed financial results, and a change of strategy that has the company moving away from fully electric vehicles and embracing gas-electric hybrids.\n\nYet there are many reasons to like F stock. The shares currently trade at only 13 times future earnings estimates. Ford also pays a hefty quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share, giving it a yield of 4.69%. Earlier this year, Ford paid a special dividend of 18 cents per share in addition to its regular dividend. The company also continues to make several bestselling nameplates such as the F-150 pick-up truck and Mustang muscle car.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Chipotle Just Split Its Stock. 3 Things to Know Before You Buy or Sell.",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) recently joined the growing list of top companies to announce or complete stock splits. The fast-casual chain executed its operation late last month, and shares began trading at their post-split price on June 26. This represented a major move for Chipotle, as it marked the company's first-ever stock split -- and the 50-for-1 operation was one of the biggest in New York Stock Exchange history.\n\nThe restaurant chain decided on the move after its shares soared more than 300% over the past five years, reaching beyond $3,000 in recent times. The split brought the price of each individual share down to about $60, making the stock easier for a wider range of investors to access. A stock split is just a mechanical operation, though -- it doesn't change anything fundamental such as valuation or market value. This means it isn't a good idea to buy a stock just because it launched a stock split.\n\nSince you may now be wondering about how you should approach the Chipotle investment opportunity today, here are three things to know before you buy or sell shares of this top restaurant chain. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Expansion is driving revenue growth\n\nChipotle has progressively increased revenue over time, even during tough moments like the worst of the pandemic. Then, Chipotle focused on its digital ordering platform, and this kept diners coming back.\n\nBut it's important to note that Chipotle isn't seeing tremendous growth at its individual restaurants from year to year. Instead, it's mainly growing by adding new restaurants. For example, in the most recent quarter, total revenue climbed more than 14% to $2.7 billion -- but comparable restaurant sales only increased 7%. This isn't a one-quarter thing, but an ongoing trend.\n\nOf course, Chipotle still has quite a way to go in its expansion plan as it aims to expand from about 3,500 locations to 7,000 in North America, and it's on track to meet the goal. So, there's room for more growth. Still, when it comes to comparable sales growth, the opportunity may be limited, and that could limit overall growth over time.\n\n2. Chipotle has a decent moat\n\nA moat is a competitive advantage that comes in many forms. In the case of Chipotle, the company's moat is the brand it's established, promising fresh and quality ingredients -- and bringing back favorite recipes for a limited time. (Most recently, this involved adding Chicken al Pastor back to menus.) This has kept customers coming back to Chipotle over time -- and rushing to get there for these special menu items that won't be around for long.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's particularly challenging to stay ahead of rivals in the fast food and fast-casual businesses, as new places pop up and people are always willing to at least give them a try. So, it's key to build a relationship with customers over time to increase the potential for revenue growth moving forward.\n\nChipotle's moat is part of the reason investors were willing to pay thousands of dollars for one share earlier this year -- and at a high valuation. The chain has proven it can be a favorite of customers for the long term, and this could keep revenue advancing.\n\n3. Valuation is high\n\nAs I mentioned above, investors have been willing to pay top dollar for access to Chipotle stock. That hasn't changed post-stock split. Today, the shares trade for more than 55 times forward earnings estimates, which is very high for a restaurant stock. Though the businesses aren't exactly the same, for a rough comparison, fast food giants McDonald's and Yum! Brands trade for about 20x. CMG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThough Chipotle may deserve a higher valuation than peers, the current level still looks pretty steep -- and could discourage some investors from buying the stock, especially if they consider the company's growth now and future prospects.\n\nShould you buy or sell?\n\nShould you buy or sell Chipotle stock? The answer to this depends on your investment style. If you're seeking to diversify and want to add a strong restaurant player to your portfolio, you may consider buying a few Chipotle shares and holding on for the long term. Growth, even if not tremendous, isn't over -- and the shares could climb from today's level over the long run. So, you could win by buying now and holding on for a number of years. This is also why you may want to hold on to at least some of your Chipotle shares if you're currently a shareholder.\n\nBut if you're a value investor, you're better off removing Chipotle from your investment menu right now. The stock has become very expensive, meaning it's not a good fit for your strategy -- and you're likely to find a more appetizing choice elsewhere.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stock-Split Stocks That Can Skyrocket Up to 130%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) is drawing a lot of attention, it can be argued that stock splits are the hottest trend on Wall Street right now.\n\nA stock split is a tool publicly traded companies can lean on to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. I say \"cosmetically,\" because stock splits have no effect on a company's market cap or its operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPublic companies can enact two types of stock splits: Forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, a company is aiming to reduce its nominal share price to make it more affordable for everyday investors. Meanwhile, the goal of a reverse-stock split is to increase a company's share price, usually with the purpose of ensuring continued listing on a major stock exchange.\n\nSince forward-stock splits are being executed from a position of operating strength, this is the type of split most investors tend to focus on.\n\nFurthermore, a Bank of America Global Research study found that companies enacting forward splits gained an average of 25.4% in the 12 months after announcing their split (since 1980), which is more than double the 11.9% average return for the benchmark S&P 500 over the same timeline. This outperformance isn't lost on Wall Street institutions or their analysts.\n\nDuring the first half of 2024, nine prominent businesses announced and/or completed stock splits, eight of which were of the forward split variety. According to high-water price targets from select Wall Street analysts, three of these stock-split stocks could skyrocket by as much as 130% over the coming year.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside of 62%\n\nThe first stock-split stock that could ascend to the heavens, at least based on the prediction of one Wall Street analyst, is AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split on May 22, which became effective after the market closed on June 7.\n\nAdjusted for the company's recent split, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann slapped a $200 price target on shares of Nvidia, which represents up to 62% upside from where shares closed on June 28. If Mosesmann's price target proves correct, Nvidia's market cap would rise to nearly $5 trillion.\n\nMosesmann's optimism boils down to two key drivers. The first involves Nvidia's dominant market share of AI-inspired graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-compute data centers. Semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights estimates that Nvidia accounted for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped last year. Nvidia's next-generation AI-GPU architecture, including Blackwell and Rubin, should help it sustain its compute advantages.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe other key driver in the eyes of Mosesmann is Nvidia's software. In particular, his lofty price target points to the success of Nvidia's CUDA platform, which is the toolkit that helps developers learn how to build large language models. Since CUDA and AI-accelerated GPUs go hand-in-hand, Nvidia has itself a high-margin one-two punch.\n\nUnfortunately, history hasn't been kind to next-big-thing innovations over the last three decades. Not one game-changing innovation or technology has avoided an early stage bubble-bursting event, and AI is unlikely to be the exception.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia has competition coming at it from all angles. In addition to external competition, which will likely chip away at its dominant AI-GPU share, the company's top four customers by net sales are all developing their own AI-GPUs. In short, we're likely witnessing a peak in pricing power and demand for Nvidia's chips. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill: Implied upside of 28%\n\nA second stock-split stock that has the necessary tools and intangibles to soar is fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board gave the green light to the company's first-ever split on March 19, with the company effecting its historic 50-for-1 forward split after the market closed on June 25.\n\nChipotle's biggest Wall Street cheerleader is Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo, who set an $80 price target on the company. If Gargiulo's forecast is correct, shareholders would be looking at an additional 28% upside from where the stock ended on June 28.\n\nGargiulo's long-term optimism for Chipotle is focused on a number of catalysts at the company's disposal. Specifically, Gargiulo's recent note spoke of the company's strong ties to Generation Z and its ability to engage with these consumers via digital platforms. Furthermore, he believes the company can lean on its loyalty program to boost higher-margin digital sales.\n\nThere's little question that Chipotle Mexican Grill's management team knows its customer base well. By using responsibly raised meats and prepping its food daily in its restaurants, management discovered a long time ago that people will gladly open their wallets and absorb inflationary price hikes.\n\nAdditionally, Chipotle's rather limited menu has served as a source of growth. Keeping its menu small allows its workers to prep meals quickly, which helps ensure that lines in its stores are continually moving.\n\nBut at some point, valuation comes into play. Although Chipotle's sales growth has consistently outpaced its peers, the company's comparable restaurant sales growth from existing locations clocked in at only 7% in the first quarter. While this is a fantastic number when compared to its competition, it doesn't come close to justifying a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 47.\n\nSirius XM Holdings: Implied upside of 130%\n\nThe third stock-split stock that can absolutely skyrocket, based on the lofty price target of one Wall Street analyst, is satellite radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI).\n\nOn June 17, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission noted that Sirius XM plans to enact a 1-for-10 reverse split when it merges with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. This merger, which'll create a single shareholder base, is expected to take place during the third quarter. This also makes Sirius XM the only high-profile company of the nine stock-split stocks in 2024 that isn't conducting a forward split.\n\nThe chief bull in Sirius XM's camp is Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan. Although Harrigan lowered his firm's price target on Sirius XM in March by $0.50 per share, his $6.50 target still implies up to 130% upside, based on where shares closed on June 28.\n\nThe challenge Sirius XM faces at the moment is the prospect of weaker auto sales. Sirius XM counts on new vehicle purchases to turn promotional users into self-pay subscribers. If the U.S. economy weakens and/or auto sales taper, this conversion to self-pay subscribers can slow, or even temporarily shift into reverse.\n\nDespite this concern, Sirius XM Holdings has a couple of well-defined competitive advantages that make it highly attractive from an investment standpoint.\n\nAs the lone satellite radio operator, the company possesses reasonably strong subscription pricing power. This helps ensure that Sirius XM can outpace prevailing inflationary pressures.\n\nSirius XM's sales channels also give it a clear-cut edge when compared to terrestrial and online radio operators. Whereas traditional radio operators rely heavily on ads for a majority of their revenue, Sirius XM generated about 78% of its net sales from subscriptions during the first quarter. Since subscribers are less likely to cancel their service than businesses are to pare back their ad spending during a downturn, Sirius XM is better suited to navigate economic uncertainty.\n\nSirius XM Holdings is also the cheapest stock-split stock -- and it's not even close. Shares of the company can be grabbed right now for less than 9 times forward-year earnings, which represents its lowest forward P/E ratio since going public in 1994.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth",
        "content": "If you're trying to build generational wealth, you shouldn't think about getting rich quick. It's all about creating a portfolio of companies that are built to last. On that score, you should keep old favorite Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and relatively young Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) on your wish list, while Hormel Foods(NYSE: HRL) might be worth adding to your portfolio right now. Here's a quick look at each stock.\n\n1. Coca-Cola is a behemoth\n\nWith a market cap of roughly $270 billion, Coca-Cola is one of the largest consumer staples companies on the planet. Don't underestimate the benefit this has for the company and for investors. For starters, Coca-Cola's business is underpinned by a stable of iconic brands, notably including namesake Coke. Moreover, the company has a global distribution network and the financial firepower to support its brands with advertising. And it's big enough to buy its way into new products and categories over time.\n\nThe consumer staples sector is one in which retailers and end consumers are both seen as customers for companies like Coca-Cola. The advantages Coca-Cola generates from its size work to entice consumers into stores and, thus, get stores to buy Coca-Cola products for sale. Small competitors that can't match up often don't get the same shelf space, effectively cementing Coca-Cola's already dominant position. But if the smaller competitors are on to something new, well, they and their hot new product might just end up a part of Coca-Cola. These are the many reasons Coca-Cola is a Dividend King, with over 60 years of annual dividend increases behind it. The dividend yield is roughly 3% today, well above the 1.3% on offer from the S&P 500 Index.\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill is established, but still growing\n\nCompared to a company like McDonald's, Chipotle Mexican Grill is still just a kid. But it has clearly established itself as a dominant force in the restaurant sector. In fact, the company's fresh made assembly line format has been copied many times over, including by recent market darling Cava. Chipotle has done so well for so long that its stock rose to herculean heights, leading it to a huge 50:1 stock split to get the price back down to the level where mere mortals could afford to buy a share. The best news? Despite the already impressive growth in Chipotle's business, it is still showing impressive signs of strength.\n\nFor example, in the first quarter of 2024 the company's overall sales rose a huge 14% year over year to $2.7 billion. For reference, the first-quarter top line at McDonald's was nearly $6.2 billion, so there's still plenty of room for growth ahead at Chipotle. But the really interesting number was Chipotle's same-store sales, which came in at 7%. Half of that figure would be considered good, noting that McDonald's managed only 1.9% in the quarter. What this tells you is that Chipotle is still benefiting from strong demand, which should allow it to keep opening new restaurants for the foreseeable future. Chipotle is focused on investing for growth, so it doesn't pay a dividend. But if you don't mind that fact, it looks like the kind of stock that you could hand on to the next generation for safe keeping. That said, the stock is always expensive, so waiting for a market downturn might lead to a better entry point.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Hormel's dividend yield is historically high\n\nLike Coca-Cola, Hormel Foods is a Dividend King. It has increased its dividend annually for 58 consecutive years. It isn't nearly as large as Coca-Cola, but it does have a stable of industry leading brands, like Spam and Planters, among many others. It is also highly innovative, bringing out \"new\" and \"improved\" products with great regularity. The words \"new\" and \"improved\" have particular power with consumers, which is one of the reasons retailers like to work with Hormel. So why is the stock's yield near its highest levels of all time at 3.7%?\n\nThe quick answer is a perfect storm. Hormel wasn't able to pass price increases on to consumers as well as its peers, margins got squeezed by inflation, avian flu has been pretty bad lately, sales in China have been slow to recover from COVID lockdowns, and the company bought the Planters brand right as the nut category of the snack sector was slowing down. Any one of these problems alone wouldn't be too big a deal. All five at the same time has investors worried that Hormel's best days are in the past. Given the company's long and successful history, though, it seems reasonable to give the management the benefit of the doubt. And you'll be paid well to wait for Hormel to muddle through to better days.\n\nOne to buy, one to consider, and one to watch\n\nGiven the negative sentiment around Hormel today, it looks like an attractive long-term buying opportunity. Coca-Cola isn't exactly cheap, but it isn't exactly expensive, either. If you want to create a reliable income stream, you might want to take a closer look. Chipotle has the best growth prospects of the three, but investors are pricing in a lot of good news. If there's a bear market and investors throw the baby out with the bathwater, as is normally the case, you might want to jump aboard.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The reduction in consumer spending and increase in prices has shaken most of the consumer brands in the U.S. These trends have left most average Americans spending more on necessities such as groceries. Most non-necessary consumer brands have been forced to bear the brunt of the slowing economy.\n\nHowever, these three recession-proof consumer brands are proving resilient in the face of the biting economy. Crushing market estimates, they strongly indicate improved earnings. Whether through strategic business decisions or favorable market conditions, these consumer brands are beating all experts\u2019 earning estimates.\n\nLet\u2019s get a glimpse of the reasons these recession-proof consumer brands are crushing earning estimates. And how do analysts expect them to perform amid a slowing economy?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFedEx Corporation (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nMemphis-based FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is a household name in the U.S. Known for its transportation and e-commerce business outfits, it was among the first delivery companies to initiate overnight delivery.\n\nFDX has performed extremely well in the recent past amid market conditions. Favorable industry trends such as an increase in the e-commerce industry and the growing consumer preference for door delivery have boosted growth and expansion.\n\nThe company\u2019s Q4 EPS HIT $5.41, crushing earning estimates of $5.34. Also, it marks a year-over-year (YOY) increase of 9.5%. While FDX\u2019S revenue of $22.109 billion fell short of earring estimates of $22.115 billion, it still represented a 0.8% increase from last year\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nAs one of the recession-proof consumer brands driving revenue growth in all its segments, analysts expect 2025 to be even better for the company. FedEx Corporation\u2019s revenue is expected to grow by a low-to-mid single-digit percentage YOY, while EPS is expected to hit a record $18.25 to 20.25.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logo\n\nSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) needs no introduction. The Detroit-based multinational automotive manufacturing company is the largest automaker in the U.S. by sales. The company is known for its four major brands of Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick.\n\nEven as the economy and consumer spending slow, GM has proven resilient. The company reports an EPS of $2.62 in the quarter ending March 2024 against an estimate of $2.08. And, it is expected to reach $9.54 by the last quarter of 2025. GM stock also recently hit a 52-week high of $49.35\n\nGM\u2019s record-breaking performance has been attributed to several strategic decisions that have so far paid off. The company announced a $6 billion stock repurchase authorization, a strategic move to efficiently deploy capital and improve shareholders\u2019 profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, the company is scaling back on its electric vehicle (EV) department, aligning its production output with the projected decrease in EV demand. The U.S. EV demand is expected to account for only 8% of the total automotive sales in the U.S. in 2024, down from the projected 10%.\n\nLikewise, GM expects to produce 250,000 EV units, down from the anticipated 300,000. Also, the company is streamlining operations in its autopilot percussion line, Cruise, which has yet to break even.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is a fast food chain restaurant known for its fast casual dining establishments. With over 3,200 establishments, CMG is one of the leading players in the fast-food industry in the U.S.\n\nIn February, Chipotle Mexican Grill reported its quarterly earnings, noting an EPS of $10.63 adjusted compared to Wall Street estimates of $9.75. And, it reported a revenue of $2.52 billion against an expected $2.49 billion. Fourth-quarter net revenue hit $282.1 million, up from $223.7 million the previous year.\n\nAccording to Forbes findings, American households spend about 14% of their income on food. Further, the percentage of this amount spent on fast food has declined by 5% to 40% due to a reduction of consumer purchasing power. So, many people are opting for grocery shopping instead. So why is the company still crushing earning estimates?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill has undertaken some major strategic investments in its product offerings by returning the popular carne asada to its menu. Additionally, it is increasing employee training and hiring within its restaurants. These moves have seen an increase in foot traffic by over 7.4% in the quarter.\n\nWith such numbers, Chipotle will not slow down any time soon. It is one of the recession-proof consumer brands that is expected to grow and expand in 2025.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in July, and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "Many retail investors might shy away from higher-priced stocks that cost hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. Even though most brokerages now allow investors to buy fractional shares of those stocks, some investors might still prefer to buy round lots (100 shares) at lower prices because they're easier to keep track of.\n\nTo reach those smaller investors, a lot of companies split their stocks to make them easier to trade. These stock splits don't change the underlying value of the company, since they merely break a single share into smaller slices, but they can make it easier to trade options or fund employee stock-based compensation plans. They also tend to generate a lot of media buzz and attract fresh interest from short-term traders. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNone of those factors should matter to long-term investors. But if we look at the fundamentals, I believe one of these stock-split stocks is worth buying right now -- while another one should be avoided.\n\nThe stock-split stock to buy: Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) executed a 50-for-1 stock split on June 26. That represented its first stock split since McDonald's spun off the fast-casual restaurant chain in an IPO in 2006.\n\nChipotle's stock price had more than doubled to nearly $3,300 in the three years leading up to its split, so it made sense to break up its shares into easier-to-trade slices. Yet I believe Chipotle's stock is still worth buying for three simple reasons.\n\nFirst, it's still opening new stores. Its year-end store count rose from 2,768 in 2020 to 3,437 in 2023, and it plans to open 285 to 315 new locations this year. Second, its comparable store sales are rising -- so its new locations are sustainable, and it isn't merely driving its sales growth with new store openings. Lastly, its annual restaurant-level operating margins have expanded over the past three consecutive years as it raised its menu prices to offset the inflationary headwinds.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2023, Chipotle's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% as its EPS increased at a CAGR of 53%. Looking ahead, it expects its rising digital orders (36.5% of its sales in its latest quarter), the stickiness of its loyalty program, installations of more drive-thru Chipotlanes, and its overseas expansion into Europe to fuel its long-term growth. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 15% and 23%, respectively, this year. It stock certainly isn't cheap at 58 times forward earnings, but I believe its impressive growth rates justify that premium valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock-split stock to avoid: Sony\n\nSony(NYSE: SONY) plans to execute a 5-for-1 split for both its Tokyo-traded shares and New York-traded American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on Oct. 1. That will mark the Japanese conglomerate's first stock split in more than two decades.\n\nSony's revenue grew at a CAGR of 13% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023 (which ended this March) in yen terms. That growth was largely driven by the expansion of its gaming, music, movies, and image chipmaking businesses.\n\nBut for U.S. investors, most of that growth was offset by the dollar's record rally against the yen. That's why Sony's Tokyo-listed shares rallied 29% in yen terms over the past three years -- but its U.S.-listed ADRs declined 15%. So unless the yen finally stabilizes against the dollar, I think it's still too risky to buy Sony's ADRs.\n\nEven if we look past those currency headwinds, we'll notice that Sony's growth is slowing down. For fiscal 2024, it anticipates just 1% revenue growth (after excluding its upcoming divestment of its Financial Services division) in yen terms, as the expansion of its image chipmaking and music divisions only partly offsets the slower growth of its gaming and consumer electronics divisions. It expects its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to only increase 6% for the year -- compared to its CAGR of 20% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023.\n\nSony's ADR shares might seem historically cheap at just 17 times forward earnings and 9 times its adjusted EBITDA. But it could continue to trade at that discount as long as the yen keeps declining and its core growth engines fizzle out. So for now, a stock split won't solve any of those issues or make it a more appealing investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says He\u2019s Not Going to \u2018Deviate\u2019 From His Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) Thesis",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell Before the Third Quarter 2024 According to Jim Cramer. Since Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program discussed the changing consumer trends in the US, wondering whether the consumer is just \u201cfed up\u201d of paying high prices and becoming \u201cfrugal.\u201d Cramer said this \u201cfrugal thesis\u201d is not \u201cobvious\u201d but he has recognized this latest trend based on some new developments. Cramer named a few consumer companies that are benefitting from the changing consumer behavior because of their discounted price offerings. Cramer rejected the notion that dollar stores are cheap. He said these stores raise prices \u201caggressively\u201d and calling them dollar stores has become a \u201cmisnomer.\u201d The CNBC host said the consumers \u201cwant prices lower\u201d and that\u2019s why dollar store companies are getting crushed in the new environment.\n\nJim Cramer also said the \u201crenting society\u201d is winning the \u201cowning society,\u201d pointing to a new trend where consumers are renting boats instead of buying them to enjoy the experience without spending a fortune.\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked some stocks he\u2019s recommending investors to buy or sell. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) Stock to Buy and Sell Before the Third Quarter 2024 According to Jim Cramer?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 60\n\nJim Cramer said in latest program that any volatility in Chipotle won\u2019t \u201cdeviate\u201d him from his age-old bullish mantra on the stock.\n\n\u201cYou know me,\u00a0 I am not going to deviate from my position. Own Chipotle, don\u2019t trade it. For ages it\u2019s been my manta and I am not going back on that.\u201d\n\nChipotle is one of the stocks Barclays analyst Venu Krishna believes could offset the tech concentration risks.\n\nIn April, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) posted strong Q1 results, which showed revenue in the period jumped by 13.9% on a YoY basis, beating estimates by $30 million. Comparable sales in the quarter increased by 7%. For the full year, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) expects its comp sales to grow in the mid to high-single digit range. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) has been steadily increasing its footprint over the past several years. Back in 2007, the company had just 704 stores. This figure now stands at 3437. One of the biggest signs of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u2019s (NYSE:CMG) strengths is its rising margins, even when the restaurant industry is reeling from high labor costs and squeezing margins. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u2019s (NYSE:CMG) current net margin of 12.45% is the highest it has been in the past decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CMG)\u00a0trades at 47X 2025 EPS estimate of $66.92 set by Wall Street analysts. This P/E is much higher than the industry of 16. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CMG)\u00a0is expected to see revenue growth of just 13-15% per year over the next 3 years, while its EPS growth is expected to come in between 3% to 20%. Analysts expect the American consumer to remain prudent in spending amid higher for longer interest rate scenario and dwindling savings. Therefore, for investors looking for high-growth stock appreciation names, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CMG)\u00a0might not be the ideal choice.\n\nAverage analyst estimate for Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) is $3244.77, which presents just 3% upside potential from the current levels. That means the Wall Street believes the stock has reached its potential and based on current catalysts and growth trajectory it does not have any room to grow significantly.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe best investment ideas are simple. We have previously written about\u00a0Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG). It turned out that this was our best investment idea since starting the fund. The stock is up 10x since we first invested at the end of 2017 (~47% annualized). Sounds absolutely incredible, except that your managers sold CMG back in 2018 (thinking that the stock had gotten ahead of itself), and proudly booked an 85% profit in 6 months, patting ourselves in the back. Interestingly, when we wrote about this in our 2019 letter, describing our big mistake to sell, the stock still went up +270% since that letter, delivering an impressive 30% annual return. This is an incredibly important point! You do not get many Chipotles in your investing career. Companies like these are super rare and the opportunity to buy them at an attractive price (which we got in 2017) is even rarer. Booking a quick profit, paying the capital gains tax and thinking that you will find another CMG to invest your proceeds into is usually delusional.\n\nAlong with our personal investment case of CMG, let us compare that to the experience that Bill Ackman had with the same investment. He is a famous hedge fund manager that we greatly admire, who has achieved an incredible track record in the past 20 years running Pershing Square. Bill Ackman has owned the restaurant stock since the third quarter of 2016 at an initial cost basis of about $411 per share (our cost basis was $289). Originally, Mr. Ackman bought 2.88 million shares. He was wise to hold on to CMG stock and it still is the top position in his fund (18% weight). But, if you follow his 13F filings, which are the public filings disclosing large investment manager\u2019s holdings of publicly traded securities, he kept trimming his position as the stock went up. We calculated that if he just sat on his original 2.88 million shares and didn\u2019t sell a share, his position would be worth $8.8 billion today. This would represent ~50% of his entire firms\u2019 assets under management (AUM). But he only has $1.8 billion invested in CMG as of Q1 2024. As Charlie Munger said: \u201c\u201cThe first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.\u201d\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell Before the Third Quarter 2024 According to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Excellent Stocks That Can Beat the S&amp;P 500",
        "content": "We all want to beat the market. It's easier said than done, but doing your homework can give you an edge on the standard portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) these days. Here are three stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 that I think can do it again over time.\n\n1. Apple\n\nAn investment gem for years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was in the news a few weeks ago for becoming more valuable than Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). The company has outpaced the S&P 500 by 234% over the last five years.\n\nIt is one of Warren Buffett's favorites, and for good reason. Its products have lots of utility, and the phone and computer businesses have a significant barrier to entry. You need deep pockets and infrastructure to get involved in this game. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNaysayers to my Apple pick will likely point to last year's 2.8% decline in revenue and the weak first quarter of 2024. What I think is being missed here is the potential demand that Apple could create from the integration of AI-based programs into its products.\n\nMost recently, the chatter around Apple has been its announcement of Apple Intelligence, its planned AI business, and potential partnership with Meta Platforms on generative AI. This could be exactly what Apple needs to gain the momentum seen by stocks such as Nvidia, whose semiconductor chips are essential to AI-based businesses.\n\nI like Apple as a play on this burgeoning business, since it stands to be a new source of demand for the tech company. It has the product lineup necessary to implement AI in a way that will appeal to its large consumer base. As I said before, Apple's devices offer a lot of utility. Integrating AI into them only stands to increase that advantage.\n\n2. Costco\n\nCostco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) is a blue chip gem. The discount king creates consistent annual growth and earnings for shareholders, and its low-price strategy positions it well in our inflationary economy, where consumers are looking for the best deals.\n\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett's late partner, loved Costco, and it's easy to see why. It has outpaced the S&P 500 by 134% over the last five years, using a strong member base that drives comparable store sales (comps). In the first 16 weeks of the company's fiscal year, total comps increased by 4.7%, with a 12.6% increase in e-commerce. May sales results showed comps gained 6.4%, with e-commerce sales gaining 15.3%.\n\nThose figures don't match Nvidia's, but the key here is consistency and profitability over time, and a business model that is beneficial to consumers at any time. Costco has averaged double-digit revenue growth over the last five years, just a part of years of revenue and net earnings increases, and there seems to be little sign that the story will change.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Cava\n\nWish you could go back and buy into Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) before it was Chipotle? Cava Group(NYSE: Cava) just might be your shot.\n\nThe latter restaurant chain operates very similarly to its Mexican counterpart but focuses on Mediterranean cuisine. I'd challenge you to find many competitors of scale in the Mediterranean space, and Cava might be a great long-term play.\n\nHaving gone public only last year, Cava shares have beaten the S&P 500 by roughly 100% in that time. The restaurant chain has seen significant growth as it pushes to create a similar story to Chipotle. First-quarter revenue increased 30.3% year over year to $256 million, while its total number of restaurants increased 22.8% year over year, to 323 locations.\n\nFor being such a young company, and a quintessential growth stock, Cava has found profitability particularly early, making $13.28 million last year. To be fair, that's not significant on a per-share basis, amounting to a mere $0.12 per diluted share, but compared to a loss of $1.30 the year prior, I like seeing a company focused on profitability early.\n\nFull-year guidance is looking for comps growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, with net new-store openings of 50 to 54. To be clear, this is an investment fully focused on growth. Earnings are not the primary thing that will drive the share price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Roundup: Noodles (NASDAQ:NDLS) And The Rest Of The Modern Fast Food Segment\n\nThe end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let\u2019s take a look at how Noodles (NASDAQ:NDLS) and the rest of the modern fast food stocks fared in Q1.\n\nModern fast food is a relatively newer category representing a middle ground between traditional fast food and sit-down restaurants. These establishments feature an expanded menu selection priced above traditional fast food options, often incorporating fresher and cleaner ingredients to serve customers prioritizing quality. These eateries are capitalizing on the perception that your drive-through burger and fries joint is detrimental to your health because of inferior ingredients.\n\nThe 6 modern fast food stocks we track reported a very strong Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 2.3%. Stocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, had a good end of 2023. But the beginning of 2024 has seen more volatile stock performance due to mixed inflation data, and modern fast food stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 1.1% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nNoodles (NASDAQ:NDLS)\n\nOffering pasta, mac and cheese, pad thai, and more, Noodles & Company (NASDAQ:NDLS) is a casual restaurant chain that serves all manner of noodles from around the world.\n\nNoodles reported revenues of $121.4 million, down 3.7% year on year, inline with\u00a0analysts' expectations.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Stock You Can Confidently Buy for the Second Half of 2024, and 2 to Avoid",
        "content": "With the exception of artificial intelligence (AI), there's not a hotter trend on Wall Street right now than companies conducting stock splits.\n\nA stock split is an event where a publicly traded company cosmetically alters its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's \"cosmetic\" in the sense that changing a company's share price and share count by the same factor has no effect on its market cap or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThere are two types of stock splits: forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are angling to make their shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase a company's share price, often with the goal of ensuring it meets the minimum continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nMost investors tend to favor forward-stock splits, because the companies enacting forward splits are typically out-innovating and out-executing their peers.\n\nSince 2024 began, nine high-profile stocks have announced or completed a stock split. However, not all of these stock-split stocks share the same outlook. As we motor into the second half of 2024, one of these stock-split stocks stands out as a phenomenal deal for patient investors, while two others are worth avoiding.\n\nStock-split stock No. 1 that's worth avoiding in the second half of 2024: Nvidia\n\nIn spite of its undeniable popularity, AI juggernaut Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the first stock-split I'd suggest investors purposefully avoid for the final six months of 2024. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 forward split on May 22, which was completed on June 7.\n\nAlthough I'm no fan of Nvidia from an investment perspective, I'm happy to give the company credit where it's due. Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) have set the standard in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, it was responsible for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that were shipped last year. Having first-mover and compute advantages over its peers has given the company substantial pricing power.\n\nBut this is where the praise ends and history works its way back into the discussion.\n\nSince the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that avoided an early stage euphoria-bursting event. This is to say that investors have overestimated the adoption and/or utility of every next-big-thing innovation or technology for 30 years (including the internet itself). While this doesn't mean artificial intelligence and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run, the simple fact that most businesses lack a concrete plan for AI suggests a bubble is brewing.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo add to this point, Nvidia's trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is strikingly similar to the P/S ratio peaks we witnessed from Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. History may not precisely repeat on Wall Street, but it does have a tendency to rhyme.\n\nWe're also starting to see evidence that competition will weigh on Nvidia's monopoly like market share in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if the company's GPUs were to maintain their compute advantages, new competitors can benefit from demand overwhelming supply -- and Nvidia can't meet all of its enterprise demand.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are internally developing their own AI-GPUs. Even if these chips are used as a complement to Nvidia's H100 GPU, it signals the intent by America's most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware.\n\nStock-split stock No. 2 to keep your distance from in the latter half of 2024: Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe second stock-split stock that investors would be wise to avoid in the second half of 2024 is none other than the hottest fast-casual restaurant chain on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board announced the company's first-ever stock split (a 50-for-1 forward split) on March 19, with its share adjustment occurring after the closing bell on June 25.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, I can recognize that Chipotle and its management team have done a lot right, even if I'm not currently a fan from an investment standpoint. Chipotle shares have rallied more than 14,800% since its initial public offering price of $22 in January 2006 due to a combination of simplicity and innovation.\n\nChipotle has kept things simple by sourcing its vegetables locally (when possible), using responsibly raised meats, prepping its food daily, and avoiding a bulky menu. The result is a well-oiled machine that quickly prepares meals and keeps lines in its stores moving.\n\nBut there's only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of a fast-casual restaurant chain. While the introduction of mobile order-dedicated drive-thru lanes (\"Chipotlanes\") has helped the company immensely, Chipotle's same-store sales grew by only 7% during the first quarter. Though 7% same-store sales growth would be phenomenal for most businesses, it's a genuine eyesore for a company valued at roughly 50 times forward-year earnings.\n\nI'll also add that 1.6% of the 7% organic growth rate in existing stores came from an \"increase in average check.\" While it's always good news when a company enjoys strong pricing power, nearly a quarter of Chipotle's organic sales growth is simply due to inflation.\n\nConsidering that there are still predictive indicators that suggest a U.S. economic downturn is on the horizon -- e.g., the historic decline in U.S. M2 money supply -- companies with premium valuations in traditionally slower-growing industries, like Chipotle, are the likeliest to get thumped if a recession does materialize. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe stock-split stock you can confidently buy for the second half of 2024: Sirius XM Holdings\n\nOut of the nine high-profile companies to have announced a stock split in 2024, eight are conducting forward splits. However, the best value of the group is the only top-tier company slated to complete a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio provider Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI).\n\nIn a June 17 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sirius XM announced its intent to conduct a 1-for-10 reverse split upon completing its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. This combination and share consolidation, which'll create a single outstanding share base, is expected to close during the third quarter.\n\nAlthough reverse-stock splits are usually undertaken by companies on the decline, Sirius XM's operating performance has pointed to steady growth over the long haul.\n\nOne of the keys to Sirius XM's success is its revenue diversity. Terrestrial and online radio providers generate most of their sales from advertising. The thing about advertising is that it's highly cyclical and prone to fluctuations. Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its first-quarter sales from ads (via Pandora).\n\nBy comparison, Sirius XM generated close to 78% of its sales in the March-ended quarter from subscriptions. Subscribers to its satellite-radio services are far less likely to cancel than businesses are to reduce their ad spending during periods of economic turbulence. Couple this with the fact that Sirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator -- ergo, it has exceptionally strong pricing power -- and you have a recipe for steady operating cash flow in virtually any economic climate.\n\nAdditionally, Sirius XM enjoys better cost transparency than most radio operators. Whereas content and royalty costs are going to ebb-and-flow from quarter to quarter, transmission and equipment expenses aren't going to change much, if at all, regardless of how many subscribers the company adds.\n\nAt no point in Sirius XM's 30 years as a publicly traded company has it been cheaper than it is now. Shares can be scooped up by opportunistic investors for just 8 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 55% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Chipotle a No-Brainer Buy Right After Its 50-for-1 Stock Split? The Answer Might Surprise You.",
        "content": "The time has finally come. On June 16, shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) underwent a closely watched and historic 50-for-1 stock split. The previous four-figure price tag of the stock is currently at about $65.\n\nManagement felt this was the right proposal, given how well the restaurant company's shares have been performing. They're up 44% in 2024, and in the past five years, have soared 348%.\n\nIs this magnificent restaurant stock a no-brainer investment opportunity right after its 50-for-1 stock split?\n\nNo fundamental changes\n\nStock splits typically happen after a company's nominal share price gets too high. Of course, this is a good problem to have for Chipotle because it means the stock has done well for investors over the years. But by artificially cutting the price, the stock can be accessible to more investors.\n\nChipotle's outstanding share count expanded 50-fold to 1.4 billion. And the share price is now 1/50th what it was before this event. It's helpful to think of this situation as a pizza being cut into smaller slices.\n\nIt's really important to remember that from a fundamental perspective, nothing has changed with Chipotle. This is still the same business it was yesterday. Through its fast-casual stores, this company still sells Tex-Mex food like bowls and burritos.\n\nSince the executive team first announced the stock split in March, shares have climbed 17%. Perhaps the anticipation of this happening is precisely what has driven even greater bullish sentiment from the market.\n\nCurb your appetite\n\nAs we view the company and stock today to assess if Chipotle is a no-brainer investment opportunity, it's critical to consider the quality of the company. This is a stellar business.\n\nThe company continues to post strong financial results, despite ongoing macro headwinds. After revenue jumped 14.3% in 2023, it rose 14.1% in Q1 2024 (ended March 31). This was boosted by same-store sales growth of 7%, as well as the opening of 47 new restaurants.\n\nChipotle is extremely profitable, which is supported by its proven pricing power. In the past five years, the company's operating margin has averaged 11.5%. And from a store-level perspective, 27.5% of revenue turned into operating profit in the first quarter, an outstanding figure.\n\nThere's still a lot of growth to be achieved. Management sees the potential to have 7,000 stores open in North America one day, roughly double the current footprint. This goal is higher than the previous target of 6,000, so it shows you that the leadership team is extremely optimistic about Chipotle's long-term prospects to further penetrate its key market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of these positive factors might make you believe that this stock is a no-brainer buying opportunity. However, consider just how high the expectations have gotten. It seems wild to me to pay a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 70.1 for the shares of this business. There's no margin of safety for investors should the company post quarterly financial results that the market isn't pleased with for whatever reason.\n\nOf course, unsustainable trends can last a lot longer than people might think. And this could be the case with Chipotle stock, as it has traded at a steep valuation for a while.\n\nNot only do I think the stock should be avoided, but I\u2019m also not comfortable calling this a no-brainer investment opportunity right now. Maybe if the P/E multiple dropped below 30, I'd adopt this view. This might not happen for a long time, though.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Warren Buffett Should Buy Chipotle Stock Hand Over Fist, and 1 Reason Why He Might Regret It",
        "content": "Through Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett owns dozens of stocks across various industries. But there's one thriving business in a sector he's familiar with that the conglomerate doesn't have a stake in.\n\nThat company is Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Its shares have skyrocketed 348% in the past five years (as of June 26), easily beating the broader S&P 500. Credit goes to the business's strong fundamental performance.\n\nHere are three reasons why the Oracle of Omaha should buy this top restaurant stock, and one obvious reason why he'd regret that decision.\n\nAppreciating strong brands\n\nSome of Berkshire's largest holdings are in companies such as Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola. These are well-recognized global brands that differentiate these businesses and their offerings in their respective industries.\n\nWhile Chipotle's brand isn't as strong as those three, it's highly regarded in the restaurant space. According to Piper Sandler's spring 2024 Taking Stock With Teens survey, Chipotle was ranked as the third most popular restaurant among Generation Z in the U.S. It moved up one spot from the fall of last year.\n\nThis business pioneered the fast-casual dining concept,\u00a0to the point where there are copycats with different types of cuisine. Chipotle's growth has been excellent, as its current store count of 3,479 is almost 40% larger than five years ago. Unsurprisingly, sales have also propelled higher.\n\nTaking care of the customer\n\nAny consumer-facing business does better when it prioritizes the needs of its customer base. Quality, convenience, and price are the top factors these customers consider when deciding where to buy their food. Chipotle does well at all three.\n\nIn recent years, the business has leaned heavily on technology to increase accessibility and convenience for consumers. Chipotle's revamped rewards program was launched in March 2019. Despite a short history, it has already amassed 40 million members. Not only can Chipotle's mobile app and loyalty program drive loyalty and repeat purchase behavior, but it also provides a useful tool to collect data and direct marketing initiatives.\n\nHandling inflationary pressures\n\nThe key theme that characterizes the economy over the past three years has been higher-than-normal inflation. The restaurant industry might be one of the most severely impacted, as costs for food, labor, and paper supplies have all increased.\n\nChipotle has successfully navigated this unfavorable backdrop by occasionally raising its menu prices in recent years. During the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), the company posted 7% same-store sales growth, part of which was driven by higher ticket sizes. The benefit has flowed through to the financials.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett believes great businesses have pricing power. \"If you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by a tenth of a cent, then you've got a terrible business,\" he once said.\n\nOne obvious risk\n\nI don't think many people would disagree that Chipotle is a quality enterprise. Even the Oracle of Omaha probably has the same perspective. So, why doesn't Berkshire buy the stock?\n\nIt all comes down to valuation, in my opinion. As a result of their impressive rise, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 70.1. This is in nosebleed territory. It indicates the market's extreme optimism surrounding the company. In other words, shares appear to be priced for perfection. If Chipotle misses revenue and earnings guidance by even a tiny bit, investors could run for the exits.\n\nBuffett would likely regret buying Chipotle stock because it trades at such a steep valuation. I'm sure most value-focused investors think the same way.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in the Second Half and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "The first half of the year brought the market many stock split announcements across industries, from technology giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) to consumer stock Walmart. These companies launched splits to lower their share prices after the shares soared to high levels -- the idea is to make it easier for more people to invest without relying on fractional shares.\n\nThese players helped drive the S&P 500 higher in the first half of the year as investors welcomed the stock split news. Stock splits aren't share performance catalysts though, as they're just mechanical movements. So, investors who seize the opportunity to buy generally are making the move for a fundamental reason -- such as confidence in the company's future growth prospects.\n\nNow, as we head into the second half of the year, you may be wondering which stock split players may continue their paths higher and represent the best long-term bets. Let's check out one to buy hand over fist, and one to avoid like the plague. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock to buy: Nvidia\n\nNvidia already climbed more than 150% in the first half of the year thanks to its booming artificial intelligence (AI) business. The company sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power some of the most crucial AI tasks -- and Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest on the market. So, it's no surprise the company holds 80% share of the AI chip market.\n\nThe tech giant also sells a wide range of related AI products and services, including enterprise software -- available through all of the public cloud service providers. This makes access to Nvidia very easy for potential customers.\n\nThis has helped the company generate record revenue quarter after quarter, grow revenue and net income in the triple digits, and widen gross margin. In the most recent quarter, revenue reached $26 billion and gross margin came in at more than 78% -- from about 64% a year ago.\n\nWhat makes me so optimistic about Nvidia in the second half and beyond? The company pledges to update its top performing chips on an annual basis, a strategy that should keep it ahead of rivals. As part of this, later this year Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell architecture and chip -- a system laced with many innovations that could make it a game-changer.\n\nAll of this means Nvidia merits its valuation of 46 times forward earnings estimates, and the stock's gains this year and into the future may be far from over.\n\nStock to avoid: Chipotle\n\nFirst, I'll start by saying Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) isn't necessarily a sell or an avoid for every investor. This fast casual chain has progressively increased earnings over time, and its expansion strategy should keep that going. Chipotle's brand strength also may help it lift revenue over the long run too. So, if you're looking to diversify your portfolio and want to buy a solid restaurant stock, you may consider adding a few shares or if you're a Chipotle shareholder today, you might want to hold on to your position.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut for the value investor, Chipotle is a stock to avoid, and here's why. The stock trades for 59 times forward earnings estimates, extremely high for the industry and high considering the source of Chipotle's growth. It's important to note that comparable restaurant sales growth has been in the mid-single digits -- increasing 7% in the first quarter of this year and 7.9% for the full year 2023. So Chipotle's growth mainly has come from adding on new restaurants -- it opened 271 last year.\n\nChipotle, now at about 3,500 locations, aims to double that to 7,000 in North America, and the company is expanding internationally too. It's fine to grow through expansion, but without stronger comparable sales increases, Chipotle doesn't look like a high-growth stock today, yet it's trading at growth stock prices.\n\nOf course, over time, Chipotle shares still may have room to run as the company's new locations start adding to revenue. But, considering the hefty price tag for this stock, as we transition into the second half of the year, value investors should avoid this expensive player like the plague.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chipotle executives have sworn up and down that the restaurant chain doesn\u2019t have a portion problem, but an analysis by Wells Fargo begs to differ.\n\nTo finally \u201cput the \u2018weight debate\u2019 to rest,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem and his team bought and weighed 75 burrito bowls, they wrote in a note this week. The analysts \u201cstudied\u201d (and hopefully later devoured) burrito bowls at eight different Chipotle locations in New York City, with half the orders placed digitally and the other half in person.\n\nThroughout the study, the analysts found that the bowls\u2019 weights were wildly inconsistent.\n\nThe median bowl ordered online and in person weighed about the same, according to the Thursday note, but the weight of the burrito bowls varied drastically in each category. For in-person orders, the heaviest bowl weighed 47% more than the lightest. The weight varied even more for digital orders, with the heaviest bowl weighing 87% more than the lightest bowl. At 13.8 ounces, the smallest burrito bowl weighed just a little more than the average can of soda.\n\nApparently, there\u2019s at least one New York City Chipotle that may also be worth avoiding, as the analysts found that many of the 10 lightest bowls were from the same unnamed store. All 10 were also digital orders.\n\n\u201cWhile throughput is improving, order consistency remains an opportunity,\u201d the analysts wrote in a Thursday note.\n\nA special look\n\nThe analysis comes as Chipotle has been criticized on social media for doling out supposedly smaller portion sizes. A rumor, which Chipotle denied, later emerged that the chain had instructed employees to give bigger portions to people recording them, sparking a flurry of videos across social media, especially on TikTok.\n\nLast month, Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol told Fortune that portion sizes had not gotten smaller, but added that customers could give employees a \u201clook\u201d to bulk up their burritos.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chipotle founder and former CEO Steve Ells reiterated that the restaurant chain\u2019s portions have not shrunk and insisted that it has, in fact, been \u201cquite generous\u201d with its portion sizes, Quartz reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced someone walking out of a Chipotle hungry in my 30 some odd years, I mean, it just doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Ells said at the Wall Street Journal Global Food Forum. \u201cSo those who complain about portion sizes, I\u2019m not sure I quite get it, but I understand it\u2019s a thing out there.\u201d\n\nAlthough the varying bowl sizes may have looked bad for the chain, Chipotle\u2019s chief corporate affairs officer, Laurie Schalow, said the variability was totally normal because of how the restaurant serves its orders.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cSimilar to others in the fast casual industry, our completely customizable meals may have variability in their size or weight depending upon the number of ingredients a guest selects or if they choose to make an ingredient extra or light when ordering from our list of real ingredients in person or digitally,\u201d Schalow said in a statement to Fortune.\n\nDespite the controversy over portion sizes, Wells Fargo found that Chipotle\u2019s foot traffic continues to increase, aside from a setback last month, and the bank is still optimistic about the stock. The company\u2019s quarter-to-date foot traffic is at its highest level in 10 quarters, the bank found.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "After languishing throughout 2022, the S&P 500 index began to climb higher last year and finally reached a new all-time peak in January. It was only the first of many new highs the index would hit this year and today it sits close to setting a new top.\n\nYet with the benchmark collection of the 500 largest companies up 15% in 2024, investors might wonder if this is good as it gets. A stock market crash is coming, the only question is when.\n\nCorrections and crashes that lead to bear markets are a part of investing. The best part about them is that they are excellent times to buy stocks. Every single bear market over the past 100 years saw a bull market follow and wipe away all vestiges of the losses that occurred. It is why investors count on S&P 500 stocks for long-term growth. It is a bet on the U.S. economy and American business. The index might fall near-term, but the long-term outlook remains bright.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following three S&P 500 stocks are ones you can buy today and know that 10, 20, or even 30 or more years down the road they will be worth appreciably more than they are today. They are stocks that can help you make your grandchildren rich.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo one knows what the future of the movie industry will look like over the next few decades. Whether we\u2019re streaming videos or watching some holographic projection, in all likelihood Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be the way most people consume media.\n\nThe streaming giant continues to pad its lead over its nearest competitor, Disney (NYSE:DIS). Netflix has 269.6 million subscribers globally after adding 37.1 million new subscribers last quarter, a 9.3 million net increase. Disney, on the other hand, has about 100 million fewer subscribers.\n\nA lot of those new subscribers undoubtedly came as a result of cracking down on password sharing. It does, however, suggest investors should not expect to see the same kind of growth moving forward.\n\nWhat will grow, however, is the revenue Netflix receives from advertising. The ad-tier plan accounted for 40% of all sign-ups in Q1 with ad-supported subscriptions rising 65% for the quarter. Available for under $7 per month, it is an affordable option in a dicey economy.\n\nWhile Netflix business is showing robust growth it can\u2019t be argued NFLX stock is cheap. The streamer trades at 47 times trailing earnings, 31 times next year\u2019s estimates, and 42x the free cash flow (FCF) it produces.\n\nIf you buy the stock now it will surely be worth much more in 2034, but waiting for a pullback in its price would increase your returns down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf figuring out how we\u2019re going to be watching movies in the future is tough, then knowing where we\u2019re going to eat is even harder. But Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) will still be there slinging burrito bowls at a handsome profit.\n\nThe combination of good, tasty food at a reasonable value will be difficult to beat, no matter when we are looking for a place to eat. Its fresh ingredients will only become more important to our diets. We might be paying $37 a bowl if inflation keeps up the way it has, but Chipotle has figured out how to navigate these impediments to growth.\n\nSales grew 14% from last year to $2.7 billion driven by a 7% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Operating margins widened to 16.3% from 15.5% a year ago as restaurant-level operating margins expanded by 190 basis points to 27.5%.\n\nNow that Chipotle Mexican Grill completed its 50-for-1 stock split, shares are trading at a more accessible $63 a share. While CMG stock also carries a lofty valuation at the moment, investors can be assured they will be richly rewarded when they pass on the stock to their grandchildren.\n\nLowe\u2019s (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeath and taxes will always be with us, but so will fixing up our homes and building new ones. It is why Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) is the third S&P 500 stock for long-term growth.\n\nThe home improvement center generates about three-quarters of its revenue from DIY customers with the balance made up by professional contractors. Although the retailer is growing its pro base, the average homeowner will continue to be the primary driver of future growth.\n\nBoth with the current housing boom and those looking to fix up what they\u2019ve got, Lowe\u2019s is positioned to capture greater sales now as well as a decade or two ahead. Certainly, high inflation and interest rates will pressure its business as consumers strapped for cash cut back on projects (have you seen how expensive lumber still is?) but it remains a profitable business. Despite slowing growth, Lowe\u2019s expanded operating profits during the period.\n\nThe DIY center also pays a generous dividend that yields 2.1% annually. Lowe\u2019s has raised the payout for more than 50 years and has an equally impressive track record of hiking it. Over the past decade, it increased its dividend at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3%. With an FCF payout ratio of 41%, your grandkids will love the compounded total returns Lowe\u2019s stock will continue providing them in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in LOW stock.

        "content": "Investors interested in stocks from the Retail - Restaurants sector have probably already heard of Compass Group PLC (CMPGY) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Compass Group PLC has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Chipotle Mexican Grill has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that CMPGY has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nCMPGY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.70, while CMG has a forward P/E of 56.43. We also note that CMPGY has a PEG ratio of 1.93. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. CMG currently has a PEG ratio of 2.49.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for CMPGY is its P/B ratio of 7.65. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CMG has a P/B of 25.50.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to CMPGY's Value grade of B and CMG's Value grade of F.\n\nCMPGY stands above CMG thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CMPGY is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) has been one tasty quesadilla of a stock on the exchange over the years. The fast-casual restaurant chain operator didn't have a good session on the market Thursday, however. Its shares fell more than 5% in value, which wasn't unusual given what happened the previous day.\n\nStock-split indigestion\n\nChipotle investors started Wednesday with a much higher number of shares than they held previously. Of course, this was due to the 50-for-1 stock split that kicked in that morning.\n\nThat ratio is pretty high -- most stock splits are more in the 10-for-1 range or so -- but it feels like a good move given how pricey the restaurant operator became on a per-share basis. A cheaper stock is a more attractive one, and it's likely many investors piled into Chipotle recently in the hopes that its popularity would surge post-split.\n\nOften with price-pushing events, when the event itself is over, many folks book the profits they made on the run-up. This quick, heavy selling tends to push a stock's price down. In the absence of any negative fundamental news for Chipotle, profit-taking is likely the main culprit for the Wednesday swoon.\n\nMore of the same\n\nIt's important to note here that, as with any stock split, the value of Chipotle stock did not change at all. Investors still held the same amount of stock in dollar terms as they had previously; the only changes were the number of shares and the price.\n\nGiven all that, no one should bail on Chipotle simply because it's on the other side of a big financial engineering effort. Believers in the company's business model might even pounce on the price weakness. After all, given Chipotle's enduing popularity, it probably won't last.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chipotle (CMG) is winning over investors, with shares up nearly 40% year to date against a difficult restaurant landscape as consumers pull back due to higher prices.\n\nOne analyst thinks there are more levers the fast-casual restaurant could pull to keep the flame burning long-term.\n\nChipotle ramping up its operating hours is one lever, wrote Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo, who has an Outperform rating and price target of $80 on the stock, following Wednesday's 50-for-1 stock split.\n\nBoth Wall Street and Main Street have long anticipated late-night or breakfast hours from the burrito chain.\n\nRevamping Chipotle's loyalty program could also boost sales. As chains ramp up personalized offerings via rewards, Chipotle could also increase its own loyalty benefits. Though the chain doesn't break out how many reward members it has, digital sales represented 36.5% of total food and beverage revenue in the first quarter.\n\nChipotle's key audience, Gen Z, presents a crucial runway for the company too, as the demographic increasingly becomes household decision-makers.\n\nGargiulo wrote that Gen Z has a significant brand affiliation with Chipotle and engages more with the brand than its peers on TikTok, which tends to skew to a younger audience of mostly 18-to-24-year-olds.\n\nChipotle boasts 55.4 million likes on the social media platform, while CEO Brian Niccol's old stomping grounds, Taco Bell (YUM), trails with 51.7 million likes. Farther behind are McDonald's (MCD), with 30.1 million likes, and Wendy's (WEN), with 20.6 million. A Chipotle Mexican Grill employee prepares food on Dec. 15, 2015, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn addition to those three long-term drivers, Gargiulo noted Chipotle's category strength represents yet another tailwind for the company.\n\nChicken is gaining popularity, as Yahoo Finance previously reported, and the cheaper protein is easier on consumers' tightening wallets, aligns with healthy eating trends, and allows companies more room for innovation. Gargiulo projects the market for chicken will grow by 7% over the next five years at limited-service restaurants.\n\nThe market for casual dining in Latin America is growing rapidly too. It grew 8% from 2018 to 2023 and is expected to grow another 6% from 2023 to 2028.\n\nInvestors hope the momentum of recent quarters sticks around. In the first quarter, Chipotle blew past revenue, earnings, and same-store sales expectations yet again.\n\nPost-stock split, shares of Chipotle are still trading at a higher price than when the company went public in 2006 at $22 per share. The stock hovered around $62 per share as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn a note to clients, TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote that the firm believes Chipotle is \"well positioned to deliver mid-single digit same-store sales annually over the medium term,\" driven by its omnichannel approach, Chipotlane drive-through innovation, and consumers' interest in ingredient transparency. Charles now has a price target of $72 on the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nTypically, stock splits are bullish for companies that conduct them. As Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith reported following Nvidia's (NVDA) 10-for-1 stock split earlier this month, stock splits tend to see an average return one year later of 25% versus about 12% for the broader market, according to analysis from Bank of America.\n\nYear to date, Chipotle shares are up 38%, outpacing the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 15% gain.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Value is on the menu this summer.\n\nRestaurant chains such as Taco Bell (YUM), McDonald\u2019s (MCD), KFC, and Burger King (QSR) have been leaning into value deals this summer in hopes of getting Americans to visit their restaurants more often and spend more when they do.\n\nIt's an attempt to turn around the narrative that fast food has gotten too expensive. Quick-service restaurant sales have finally started to flag after chains hiked prices over the past few years to offset higher labor and commodity costs, deterring diners, especially lower-income consumers.\n\nThat shift has been reflected in the hit to restaurant stocks this year. Shares of McDonald's and Wendy's (WEN) are both down 13% year to date, while shares of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International are down 11.3% and YUM! Brands is up just 1%.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX), which calls itself an affordable luxury, is now struggling to encourage investors it still is, with shares down 18% in 2024. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), meanwhile, is up nearly 15%.\n\nEnter value meals \u2014 which Wall Street pros say could boost foot traffic but lower margins.\n\nMany will be watching closely throughout July, which Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer called a \"pivotal month for the fast food industry,\" for proof that the \"$5 meal bundle is enough to accelerate industry sales.\"\n\nThe limited-time value deal comes down to a simple proposition: When value strategies work, it's because increased foot traffic offsets lower margins to bring in more dollars, Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop said. Consumers adding more items to their checks also helps.\n\n\u201cIt really comes down to \u2026 repeat visits after the fact,\u201d R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cYou're not making money on the value menu. You're making menu money on the other products, the more premium products, the dessert products, the beverage products that go along with that.\u201d Customers place orders at a McDonald's restaurant at a shopping mall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on April 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Vincent Thian) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nWhile consumers may be happy about the cheaper prices, it's not guaranteed to be a good deal for fast food companies. And more competitors in the value arena could lead to no clear winner in the end.\n\n\"A value war is good for no one,\" Dunlop said. \"It's also the typical reaction that we see when industry traffic slows down. ... Everyone's dominant strategy when traffic is down is to promote, discount, and lean into value, but all players lose if their peers also make that choice.\"\n\nValue battle heats up\n\nOn Thursday, Taco Bell was the latest quick-service restaurant to introduce a value offering. With a name that plays on the idea that fast food is now a luxury, the $7 Luxe Box menu includes a Chalupa Supreme taco, beefy five-layer burrito, double-stacked taco, chips and nacho cheese sauce, and a medium drink.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company said the bundle provides a 55% discount on the total price of the items if they were bought separately. And Nola Krieg, who is behind product development at Taco Bell, said the box echoes previous $5 box deals the taco chain has offered since the late 2000s.\n\n\"What we found is an opportunity to give consumers an ... abundant meal at a price that everybody can afford, at $7,\u201d Taco Bell chief marketing officer Taylor Montgomery told Yahoo Finance, also hinting that other chains' value offerings may not be as hearty. Taco Bell introduces the $7 Luxe Box menu, which includes a Chalupa Supreme, Beefy Five-Layer Burrito, Double Stacked Taco, chips & Nacho Cheese sauce, and a medium drink. (Yahoo Finance at Taco Bell HQ in Irvine, Calif.)\n\nTaco Bell's offering compares to others rolling out across fast food. McDonald's $5 value menu, which began Tuesday, includes the choice of a McDouble burger or McChicken sandwich in addition to a four-piece chicken McNuggets, small fries, and a small soft drink.\n\nSimilarly, KFC's $4.99 meal offers two pieces of chicken, a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, and a biscuit, while Burger King\u2019s $5 Your Way Meal includes the choice of a Chicken Jr., Whopper Jr., or bacon cheeseburger to go with fries, nuggets, and a drink.\n\nWendy's also sweetened the deal for its $5 Biggie Bag, an ongoing deal introduced five years ago, by throwing in a free Frosty. And even Starbucks is offering a \u201cpairing menu.\u201d For $5 or $6, customers can get a small iced or hot coffee with a butter croissant or breakfast sandwich.\n\nAnd while promotions are back in a big way, this tasty competition isn't new in the industry.\n\nIn 2016, McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's competed over price. McDonald's had its McPick $2 menu, Burger King had a five-for-$4 meal deal, and Wendy's had a four-for-$4 deal. All saw a 3% to 5% sales boost in the first quarter of 2016.\n\nFast food back in focus\n\nSo, is it working this time around? Preliminary results show these deals just might be.\n\nOver the \u201clast two weeks in particular, we started to see [fast food restaurants] come back into the focus of a lot of consumers as these value menus rolled out,\u201d Hottovy said, adding that this \u201cextreme value is really resonating with consumers right now.\u201d\n\nBurger King is \u201cdefinitively\u201d seeing positive traction from its $5 promotion, Hottovy noted, while Wendy\u2019s ongoing $5 Biggie Bag and Frosty freebie seem to be luring customers in too.\n\nMost of these runs are for a limited time only, though, so time will tell if these promotions play out favorably for fast food giants, especially as grocery stores and casual dining chains like Cava (CAVA), Chipotle (CMG), and Sweetgreen (SG) offer customers competitive alternatives.\n\nIf the deals aren't compelling enough to boost traffic, the chains may be reluctant to renew them.\n\n\u201cIt's reasonable to expect that [if] franchisees do not see incrementality in profit, they're going to be pushing back, and they're going to be unhappy with signing off on a ... subsequent promotion,\u201d Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo told Yahoo Finance.\n\nEvercore's Palmer believes the success of these deals comes down to who can best communicate them to consumers.\n\n\"We suspect the answer will come in the advertising effectiveness \u2014 will it leverage McDonald\u2019s $1 billion national advertising budget?\" he wrote. \"Should McDonald\u2019s be able to stabilize traffic with value in 3Q the steady stream of new products in 2H24 and 2025 should kick off a substantial brand recovery.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Where Will Chipotle Mexican Grill Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE: CMG) extraordinary leap to the top of the food (or restaurant) chain has yielded thousands of percentage points in gains for loyal investors. Chipotle's share price has reached so high that it's undertaking a 50-for-1 split this week.\n\nStock splits often reflect management's confidence that the stock price can go still higher. Let's see where we can expect Chipotle to be five years from now.\n\nMuch bigger\n\nThis chain of fast-casual restaurants serves fresh, healthy Mexican-style fare. It sources local produce and touts that it uses only 53 ingredients (all of which you can pronounce) and has no freezers on its premises -- everything is made fresh, every day. It has created a model food-preparation process that ensures meals meet its standards and please customers.\n\nThe chain has a low number of menu items so that food can be prepared quickly and freshly, and management has an innovation-driven culture. That has resulted in some popular new dishes and a focus on digital and delivery, bringing it into the omnichannel era.\n\nAll of this is driving high customer adoption and retention rates, illustrated by consistently strong revenue and comparable-store sales (comps) growth. Sales increased 14% year over year in the 2024 first quarter, including a 7% hike in comps.\n\nThe concept is so popular that Chipotle is expanding into new regions to meet high demand. Despite its widespread presence in many urban areas, it sees the opportunity to expand further and is targeting the suburban neighborhoods where many of its affluent consumers live.\n\nManagement thinks it can double its store count from the 3,500 it has today to reach 7,000 in North America alone. It plans to open about 300 stores this year, and at that rate, it should have around 5,000 in five years.\n\nThat itself is a huge growth driver, and with Chipotle's reliable comps growth, it's a double boost for increasing total revenue. It also still gives it more room to keep expanding over the next several years.\n\nA stronger international presence\n\nChipotle has a handful of restaurants outside of North America, but it's expanding globally. Its 68 stores in the U.K., Germany, and France are all company owned, and it recently signed its first-ever franchise agreement for restaurants in the Middle East.\n\nThis could be an interesting and lucrative change for Chipotle, and the company is clearly taking it very slowly. It hadn't entered a new country in 10 years before signing the franchise agreement, with its first store opening in Kuwait. It also hasn't expanded extensively in the three European countries where it operates. However, management said that it's going to speed up openings both in North America and internationally.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the chain is still rapidly growing on its home turf, it makes sense to hold off on a grand international expansion plan. In five years, it should have a broader presence in new countries outside of North America and potentially more franchised stores, which are a whole new kettle of fish. But they are a high-margin business and could add a lot to the company as a whole.\n\nA higher stock price\n\nChipotle stock is up nearly 300% over the past five years, and if you chart its revenue and earnings growth, you'll see why. CMG Chart\n\nIf it can sustain its high growth and wide margins, it can conceivably accomplish this feat again over the next five years.\n\nChipotle shares trade at a high price-to-earnings multiple of near 69, which prices in strong growth. If growth slows, the stock won't be able to sustain such a premium valuation, and its price won't climb quite as fast. But even if that happens, investors are still likely to enjoy market-beating gains.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The Best Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Investors love stock splits. Although they don't change the fundamental value of a business -- they simply divide its profits among a larger number of shares -- stock splits are regarded as a powerful signal from a company's leadership team that good times are ahead.\n\nThis certainly appears to be the case for two of the stock market's best-performing stocks, both of which remain strong buys today.\n\nStock-split stock to buy No. 1: Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nProven businesses with long runways for growth can be lucrative investments. Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) is one such company.\n\nChipotle sustainably sources fresh, high-quality ingredients and cooks them via classical methods. The restaurant chain's delicious fare is then made to order and served quickly. Yet, its competitors have found this deceptively simple strategy difficult to duplicate. It's an art as much as a science -- one that Chipotle has nearly perfected over more than three decades.\n\nMany restaurant companies are also struggling with labor shortages. Chipotle, however, is overcoming this challenge by building a reputation as a top employer that treats its employees well. The fast-casual leader offers a career path that pays up to $100,000 in total annual compensation in as little as three years' time.\n\nThis pipeline of motivated employees is allowing the burrito baron to launch new stores at a rapid pace. Chipotle plans to open as many as 315 restaurants in 2024. Peering further into the future, management sees room for 7,000 locations in North America, up from about 3,500 stores today. This store growth target doesn't include promising international markets like Europe and the Middle East, which also have vast potential for expansion.\n\nMoreover, Chipotle's profit margins are expanding at its existing locations. Its same-store sales rose by 7% in the first quarter, driven by traffic and menu price increases. That helped the company's restaurant-level operating margin improve by nearly 2 percentage points to 27.5%.\n\nWith its business firing on all cylinders and its future bright, Chipotle decided to reward its shareowners with a 50-for-1 stock split on June 25. Management noted that the split is one of the biggest in the storied history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nStock-split stock to buy No. 2: Nvidia\n\nIf you're looking for a company with an even larger growth opportunity, consider Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware pegs its long-term addressable market at a shocking $1 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia provides semiconductor chips that are vital to a host of fast-growing end markets, such as data centers, industrial automation, and autonomous vehicles. Demand for its technology, in turn, is soaring. The chipmaker's revenue rose by 262% year over year to $26 billion in the quarter ended April 28. Its net profits climbed by an even more astonishing 628%, to $15 billion.\n\nNot one to rest on its laurels, Nvidia is accelerating its pace of innovation. Management now intends to launch a new line of cutting-edge chips every year, rather than its previous two-year cadence. CEO Jensen Huang believes this will help to keep competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel at bay.\n\nNvidia's CUDA software is another powerful competitive advantage. The company's platform is installed on hundreds of millions of computers around the world. Perhaps more importantly, over 5 million developers are trained to use the software to speed up thousands of computing applications. The time and money spent to acquire these skills would make it costly for developers -- and the businesses that employ them -- to switch to another platform.\n\nWith its competitive position secured, Nvidia chose to reward its shareholders with a 10-for-1 stock split on June 7. And with a long runway for expansion still ahead, the tech titan's shares remain a solid buy today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.'s (NYSE:CMG) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",
        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE:CMG) stock increased significantly by 13% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Chipotle Mexican Grill's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nView our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Chipotle Mexican Grill is:\n\n39% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$3.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.39.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's Earnings Growth And 39% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Chipotle Mexican Grill has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, Chipotle Mexican Grill's considerable five year net income growth of 35% was to be expected.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Chipotle Mexican Grill's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 26%. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Chipotle Mexican Grill fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Chipotle Mexican Grill Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Chipotle Mexican Grill's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this Mexican food chain have returned +7.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.4% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which Chipotle belongs, has lost 16% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Chipotle is expected to post earnings of $0.31 per share, indicating a change of -97.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.11 points to a change of -97.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.33 indicates a change of +20.2% from what Chipotle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Chipotle.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMG _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Chipotle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.92 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +16.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.35 billion and $12.84 billion estimates indicate +15% and +13.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nChipotle reported revenues of $2.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.1%. EPS of $13.37 for the same period compares with $10.50 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.01%. The EPS surprise was +14.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nChipotle is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Chipotle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "There\u2019s no bad time to buy A-rated stocks. But if you want to be richer than you are now, one of the best things you can do for yourself this June is to invest in A-rated stocks and watch the returns come in.\n\nWhen I\u2019m talking about A-rated stocks, of course, I\u2019m referring to the rankings assigned to all stocks by the Portfolio Grader. Stocks get \u201cA\u201d ratings based on their earnings performance, growth history, analyst sentiment and momentum.\n\nYou have a much better chance to make money with A-rated stocks than with those that have a poor rating, so I always use the Portfolio Grader as a tool when I\u2019m looking at new stocks, or when its time to rebalance my portfolios.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJune is the perfect time for this exercise. We are approaching the end of the second quarter, which is an ideal time to check on your portfolio to see how it\u2019s performing compared to the general market.\n\nJune is also a time where many companies announce quarterly earnings and issue or reaffirm guidance for the rest of the year. That\u2019s important information for any investor, especially for those of us looking at A-rated stocks.\n\nThe stock market continues to be strong this year, carried primarily by tech stocks.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to lose out on the opportunities that the markets offer this June, so I encourage you to review your holdings versus the Portfolio Grader and look to optimize your holdings. If you\u2019re looking to make a change, these seven stocks are ideal selections.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times over the course of the last year I led off a series of recommendations with the semiconductor maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). But if you\u2019re a skittish investor, you may be nervous about the recent dip this company saw.\n\nDon\u2019t be.\n\nFollowing another great earnings report and the company\u2019s successful 10-for-1 stock split, Nvidia extended its mammoth run to a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion and was briefly the No. 1 company in the world in terms of market capitalization.\n\nBut then we saw a dip \u2014 roughly 13% over three trading sessions, and some people started saying that the NVDA bubble was finally popping.\n\nThey were wrong \u2014 NVDA is already climbing its way back up. And Nvidia hardly represents a bubble. This is a company that makes that powerful semiconductors that handle the most complex computer operations, including machine learning, generative artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.\n\nNvidia has a massive market share in making these chips, with even better products in the workflow to be released over the next few quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s why analysts from Bank of America and Jefferies are still touting NVDA stock, and why you\u2019re going to see Nvidia continue to gain new highs in 2024.\n\nNVDA stock is up 154% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome company has to make the server infrastructure that allows companies who are buying up NVDA chips to package them together and so they can run generative AI.\n\nThat\u2019s where Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), or Supermicro, comes in.\n\nSMCI took a hit recently as its stock price fell from nearly $1,200 to less than $800. But the stock is already rebounding, helped in no small part by Nvidia\u2019s strength and the bullish sentiment that surrounds it.\n\nThe company is also making some key moves, such as collaborating on building a large AI data center in Japan, and it\u2019s work into building \u201cDirect Liquid Cooling\u201d servers that would offer energy cost and environmental advantages over those that utilize traditional fan-based cooling systems.\n\nIf you\u2019re kicking yourself for not buying SMCI when it was under $800, don\u2019t fret. This company has a long path ahead of it and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it go back over $1,000 and re-challenge its previous highs.\n\nSMCI stock is up 196% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nI love a good stock split, because they instantly increase the liquidity of a stock by making shares more affordable.\n\nThe share price decreases as the total number of shares increase, so while an individual investor still has the same position in the company, the number of shares they have increase.\n\nFor example, when Nvidia had a share price of $1,200 and did its 10-for-1 split, an investor with a single share of NVDA stock suddenly had 10 shares valued at $120 each.\n\nThat brings us to Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), which more than topped Nvidia\u2019s trick. Chipotle just completed an amazing 50-for-1 split, bringing the share price from $3,283 to roughly $65.\n\nBut if you had a single CMG share, you now have 50 of those beauties, and you know the price is going to be climbing again.\n\nChipotle is one of the best restaurant stocks on the planet, with more than 3,400 locations dishing out its freshly made Tex-Mex fare.\n\nSecond-quarter results won\u2019t be out until late July, but the company had a solid first quarter with revenue of $2.7 billion rising by 14.1% from a year ago. Chipotle also reported that comparable restaurant sales were up an impressive 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%.\n\nCMG stock is up 45% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the owner of some of the most popular social media and advertising platforms on the planet, including Instagram, Facebook, Threads and WhatsApp.\n\nWhile many call Meta purely a social media company, it will always be an advertising powerhouse in my book \u2014 especially considering that it saw roughly 98% of its revenue come from advertising in the first quarter.\n\nMeta\u2019s advertising is so popular because they do it right. Meta has amassed an amazing amount of data about its users, including hobbies and interests, locations and their social networks. They use that information to allow advertisers to precisely target offerings to the people who are most likely to buy a product.\n\nMeta is also making an effort in the AI world with Meta AI, a large language model that would be capable of answering queries, solving problems and performing other functions on Meta\u2019s platforms.\n\nMeta will continue to be a workhorse for your portfolio. The stock is up 44% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThat brings us to Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), which is truly a legacy technology company. The company made its name as a manufacturer of computers laptops and mobile devices, but its future is in AI as well.\n\nNvidia has a key partnership with Dell, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang touts that Dell\u2019s large server business makes it easier for companies to get into AI.\n\nDell and Nvidia are working hand-in-hand to create an AI factory that would help xAI, the artificial intelligence venture fronted by Elon Musk, create an AI supercomputer to power the Grok chatbot, among other things.\n\nMusk says that Dell will assemble half the racks that are going to be used for the xAI supercomputer. Supermicro is also involved in the effort.\n\nAll this will be important for Dell stock moving forward. DELL is up 83% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) The Netflix (NFLX) logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.\n\nSource: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust a few years ago, I think it would have been fair to have legitimate concerns about Netflix.\n\nThe company seemed to have hit a wall \u2014 subscription growth was weak, other streaming services were taking off, stripping Netflix of some of its most popular content (such as the Star Wars franchise, the Marvel franchise and hit sitcoms like Friends and The Office).\n\nBut wow, did Netflix turn things around, or what?\n\nThe biggest move that it made was ending the password-sharing practice that Netflix had long turned a blind eye to. It recognized that its platform was still desirable, and that people were willing to pay for it.\n\nSo it instituted an $8 surcharge for people who were sharing their accounts with someone outside of their platform \u2014 kids in college, former roommates and ex-romantic partners, for instance.\n\nThat left customers with the choice of paying the surcharge or allowing those external household members to get their own accounts. Both decisions are a win for Netflix.\n\nEarnings in the first quarter showed revenue of $9.3 billion, up from $8.1 billion a year ago. Global streaming paid memberships hit 269.6 million, up 16% from a year ago, and net income was $2.06 million, up from $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNetflix is still special and still growing, and it\u2019s the premiere streaming service on the market. The stock is up 38% in 2024 and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) isn\u2019t a tech stock, but its made what may be one of the most popular breakthroughs of the decade. The biotech company created a drug that\u2019s approved by the Food and Drug Administration to help people lose weight.\n\nZepbound is an injectable drug that won FDA approval in November 2023 and is geared to the 42% of the U.S. population that are classified as obese. The drug in Zepbound, tirzepatide, is also used in another highly successful Lilly product called Mounjaro, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhile Lilly is now pouring billions of dollars into expanding its manufacturing facilities to produce Zepbound and Mounjaro, the company has another amazing drug around the corner.\n\nAn FDA panel voted unanimously in favor of the company\u2019s\u00a0donanemab drug, which would be used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. The full FDA still needs to give final approval, but that\u2019s fully expected to happen soon.\n\nThese catalysts make LLY stock a must-own for 2024. Eli Lilly stock is up 55% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had long positions in NVDA, SCMI and LLY.

        "title": "Meet the Stock-Split Stock I've More Than Quadrupled My Stake In This Year (Hint: It's Not Nvidia, Broadcom, or Chipotle Mexican Grill)",
        "content": "One of Wall Street's few constants is that there's always a next-big-thing innovation and/or group of game-changing businesses for investors to flock to. For example, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has investors scooping up AI stocks like they're going out of style.\n\nBut even before AI became the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street, investors were gravitating to companies conducting stock splits. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies to make superficial changes to their share price and outstanding share count. I call these changes \"superficial\" because altering a company's share price and share count by the same magnitude has no impact on market cap or operating performance.\n\nStock splits come in two varieties: forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, a company is aiming to make its share price more nominally affordable for retail investors. By comparison, a reverse-stock split is designed to increase a company's share price, often with the purpose of ensuring it meets the minimum listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nInvestors usually focus their attention on high-flying companies enacting forward-stock splits. Since this year began, eight of the nine highest-profile stock-split announcements have been of the forward-split variety.\n\nOver the last two months, I've been aggressively adding to one of these nine high-profile stock-split stocks -- albeit probably not the one you're thinking of.\n\nWall Street's highest-profile stock-split stocks are on my watchlist, but not in my portfolio\n\nFor years, forward-stock splits have acted as a beacon to clue investors into businesses that have been out-executing and out-innovating their competition. In 2024, three of these perennial outperformers have announced and/or completed stock splits.\n\nArtificial intelligence colossus Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) announced plans to conduct a 10-for-1 forward split, which became effective following the closing bell on June 7. The board of fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) approved a 50-for-1 forward-stock split on March 19, which went into effect earlier this week (after the closing bell on June 25). Semiconductor networking solutions specialist Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) unveiled plans for a 10-for-1 split on June 12, with an effective date of July 15. It marks the first split in Broadcom's history, since being acquired by Avago Technologies in 2016.\n\nThis stock-split trio is getting abundant attention on Wall Street -- and for good reason. All three companies have been crushing it on an operating basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the standard in AI-accelerated data centers. Demand for Nvidia's AI-GPUs has swamped supply, leading to phenomenal pricing power. Further, most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are Nvidia's top customers by net sales. Chipotle's management team has stuck to its promise of using locally sourced vegetables (when possible) and responsibly raised meats in its restaurants to court consumers looking for higher-quality food. Additionally, keeping its menu limited helps to expedite food prep and shortens the wait time for customers. Broadcom is enjoying a huge uptick in demand for its AI networking solutions, including its Jericho 3 AI fabric, which can connect up to 32,000 GPUs and maximize their compute capacity. Beyond AI, Broadcom is a key supplier of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones.\n\nWhile all three of these high-flying stock-split stocks (for better or worse) have a place on my watchlist, they won't be found in my 42-stock investment portfolio. Rather, the stock-split stock I've more than quadrupled my stake in over the last two months is the only high-profile business to notify its shareholders of a coming reverse split. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSay hello to the reverse stock-split stock I can't stop buying\n\nReverse-stock splits often have negative connotations. That's because the companies conducting them have usually seen their share price plunge. But this isn't always the case, as evidenced by the $11 billion market cap company I've been piling into: Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI).\n\nIn December 2023, Liberty Media announced that its Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group(NASDAQ: LSXMA)(NASDAQ: LSXMB)(NASDAQ: LSXMK) would be merged with Sirius XM Holdings to create a new public company (\"New Sirius XM\") with a single outstanding share class. Having the Liberty Sirius XM Group tracking stock as the primary owner of Sirius XM's outstanding shares has, admittedly, been confusing for years. Combining the two, which should occur during the third quarter, will end the confusion and any unexplained arbitrage between the securities.\n\nBut as things now stand, Sirius XM Holdings has approximately 3.85 billion shares outstanding. Some mutual funds and institutional investors simply won't purchase stocks with a share price below $5 because they're deemed too risky.\n\nA June 17 8-K filing from Sirius XM notes that amendments have made to this merger agreement that'll result in a 1-for-10 reverse split upon closure. This should increase the new company's share price to nearly $30 (based on the June 21 close), and will likely entice new institutional investors and mutual funds to take the plunge.\n\nBut let's be clear: I haven't more than quadrupled my stake in Sirius XM because of any stock split. I've done so because of the company's clear-cut competitive advantages and historically cheap valuation.\n\nSirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator, and that comes with its own unique advantages. Although it's still competing for listeners with terrestrial and online radio operators, being the only satellite-radio operator affords the company reasonably strong subscription pricing power.\n\nI'll also add that some aspects of Sirius XM's cost structure are highly transparent and predictable. While revenue share, royalties, and content costs are going to vary from one quarter to the next, transmission expenses and equipment costs tend to be relatively fixed no matter how many subscribers the company has. The predictability of its cost structure often leads to consistent operating cash flow year after year. This is why Sirius XM can comfortably afford to dole out more than $400 million annually in dividends to its shareholders.\n\nAnother critical difference between Sirius XM and traditional radio operators is how the former generates revenue. Whereas terrestrial and online radio providers rely heavily on advertising, Sirius XM has historically brought in less than 20% of its net sales from ads. The bulk of its revenue comes from subscriptions.\n\nWhile businesses are quick to reduce their ad spending during economic downturns, consumers are less likely to cancel their satellite-radio subscription. In short, Sirius XM is better-positioned to deal with economic turbulence than its peers.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is its valuation. As of the closing bell on June 21, Sirius XM was trading at 9 times forward-year earnings and less than 6 times forecast cash flow per share in 2024 and 2025. This represents a greater-than 50% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years, and over a 40% discount to its average cash flow multiple for the last half-decade.\n\nWith a dividend yield of nearly 4% in tow, Sirius XM is the stock-split stock I can't stop buying.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sirius XM right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Sirius XM wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why rising avocado prices won't be a big deal for Chipotle",
        "content": "Avocado prices are in limbo following a disruption in Mexico, but one analyst doesn't think Chipotle (CMG) investors have anything to fear.\n\nThis week, the US Department of Agriculture resumed avocado inspections in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, the country's largest avocado exporter, after they were suspended following an attack on two USDA employees earlier this month. The USDA plans to \"gradually begin to return to the packing plants,\" the Associated Press reported, but said that additional security protocols are needed before operations fully resume.\n\nFollowing the incident, the price per box of Hass avocados from Michoac\u00e1n spiked roughly 54% from June 14 to June 18, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWhile consumers and investors might assume this could be bad for the overall Chipotle model \u2014 and drive up guacamole prices further (a side of the dip sells for $3 in NYC) \u2014 Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo argued the impact may be limited.\n\n\"Chipotle has more limited exposure to avocado than I think most investors might assume,\" Gargiulo told Yahoo Finance. A bowl of food from Chipotle in Miami. (Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (Jeff Greenberg via Getty Images)\n\n3 reasons why avocado prices aren't a big deal for Chipotle\n\nGargiulo estimated that avocados only represent around 3% to 5% of Chipotle's total restaurant expenses and a high-single-digit mix, approximately 8%, of its food basket costs.\n\nFor comparison, beef makes up 20% of Chipotle's food basket and chicken makes up 15% while dairy and packaging each make up 10%.\n\nChipotle has also been \"diversifying their purchases over time\" by sourcing avocados from different places like California, Gargiulo said. Now, he added, a \"majority\" of the avocados are coming from Peru.\n\nLastly, Gargiulo suspects the restaurant chain is hedging potential risks through \"long-term contracting with suppliers that can help Chipotle mitigate some of these exposures.\"\n\n\"If you look at the correlation of avocado prices with the overall margins, there is no clear correlation,\" he said. \"Management has been able to adjust the margins accordingly, and [has been] able to deliver better results than feared.\"\n\nChipotle's operating margin last quarter was 16.3%, up from 15.5% the year prior, while the restaurant-level operating margin was 27.5%, an increase of 190 basis points.\n\nIn a call with investors following the burrito chain's first quarter earnings results, CFO Jack Hartung said the company expects its cost of goods to be in the \"mid-29% range due to higher prices across several items.\" For the remainder of the year, Chipotle expects inflation for its food costs to be in the mid-single-digit range.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Hartung specifically called out inflation in avocados, noting that the company anticipates \"a step-up from the low levels we have seen over the past several quarters.\"\n\nChipotle stock was flat on Wednesday afternoon following the company's 50-for-1 stock split.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "California's iconic In-N-Out raised prices after minimum wage hike \u2014 but drive-through lines remain healthy\n\nFor many burger lovers, In-N-Out ranks as one of their top go-to spots. However, if you visit one of its locations in California, the chain\u2019s home state, you might notice that the prices have recently increased.\n\nThe reason has to do with the minimum wage hike in the Golden State. On April 1, California raised the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour.\n\nDon't miss\n\nBeating the market is no myth: These expert stock-pickers' recent success could help you build generational wealth 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs \u2014 take advantage today These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\nThe new law applies to fast food chains with 60 or more locations nationwide\n\nIn-N-Out, which has the majority of its over 400 outlets in California, implemented its price hike on the same day the new minimum wage went into effect.\n\n\u201cOn April 1, we raised our prices incrementally to accompany a pay raise for all of the Associates working in our California restaurants. The price increase was also necessary to maintain our quality standards,\u201d the private company said in a statement to KTVU Fox 2.\n\nLoyal fans of the chain don\u2019t seem to mind, though. Standing next to a long line of cars in the drive-through at In-N-Out\u2019s Alameda location, KTVU reporter Betty Yu noted that \u201cthis is not uncommon\u201d and \u201cthe demand for In-N-Out is strong.\u201d\n\nPittsburg resident Chris Hachlica, who eats at the burger chain every other week, told the television station, \u201cThe price increase? I understand, because the economy is kind of bad.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Birmingham from Alameda also understood the need for the price hike.\n\n\u201cI've always heard that In-N-Out treats their employees well. It seems like that's part of their branding and so we're definitely down to support that, especially in the Bay Area, when cost of living is so high,\u201d Birmingham told KTVU.\n\nYou know your burgers are delicious when customers sympathize with your price hikes. However, In-N-Out remains a private company, making it difficult for everyday investors to get involved.\n\nThe good news? Other fast food chains are also finding their footing in this inflationary environment. Here\u2019s a look at three of them.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nAt a time when several restaurants are facing closures and bankruptcies, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stands out: the company opened 47 new restaurants in Q1 of 2024.\n\nIt\u2019s also a market darling, as Chipotle shares have climbed over 46% in 2024. Over the last five years, the stock has surged by 348%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from this kind of share price performance, business is firing on all cylinders.\n\nIn Q1, Chipotle reported a 14.1% year over year increase in revenue to $2.7 billion, driven by new restaurant openings and a 7.0% rise in same store sales.\n\nFor full year 2024, the company plans to open 285 to 315 new restaurants and expects same store sales growth in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage.\n\nNote, that Chipotle has announced a 50-for-1 stock split, scheduled for June 26. Shareholders of record as of June 18, 2024 will receive 49 additional shares for each share they held, with the distribution occurring after market close on June 25.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief financial and administrative officer Jack Hartung commented that the stock split will make the stock \u201cmore accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors.\u201d\n\nRead more: \u2018You didn\u2019t want to risk it\u2019: 80-year-old woman from South Carolina is looking for the safest place for her family\u2019s $250,000 savings. Dave Ramsey responds\n\nRestaurant Brands International\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR) came into existence in 2014 through the merger of Burger King and Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons. The company expanded its portfolio by acquiring Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in 2017 and Firehouse Subs in 2021.\n\nShares have had a choppy ride lately \u2014 they are down almost 10% year to date.\n\nDespite the fluctuations in the stock market, the company's operations appear robust. In Q1 of 2024, Restaurant Brands\u2019 revenue totaled $1.74 billion, marking a 9.4% increase year over year and beating Wall Street expectations. Same store sales grew 6.9% at Tim Hortons, 3.8% at Burger King, 5.7% at Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and 0.3% at Firehouse Subs.\n\nHowever, the company's adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 73 cents, down from 75 cents in the prior-year period.\n\nDuring the earnings conference call, CEO Josh Kobza noted a shift in consumer behavior due to heightened price sensitivity. He emphasized the need to increase customer visits to the stores, stating, \u201cIn our own data we've seen consumers become a bit more sensitive to price resulting in moderating check growth. This is why driving traffic is so important and why I'm so pleased to see our brands deliver better traffic than most of the industry this past quarter.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s\n\nAs the largest fast-food chain in the world, changes in McDonald\u2019s (MCD) menu prices \u2014 such as $18 Big Macs at one location \u2014 can make headlines.\n\nIn response to this, McDonald's USA president Joe Erlinger penned an open letter to the company\u2019s American \u201cfans.\u201d He wrote that the average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019 and \"despite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures,\" the average cost is now $5.29. He added that it\u2019s the franchisees who set menu prices for their restaurants.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, the company's revenue grew 5% year over year to $6.17 billion. Adjusted earnings per share also improved \u2014 by 2% from a year ago to $2.70. However, earnings per share and both global and U.S. same store sales growth came below Wall Street expectations.\n\nMCD shares are down over 13% in 2024, but it can be argued that business is still heading in the right direction.\n\nCEO Chris Kempczinski said the \"consumer is certainly being very discriminating in how they spend their dollar\" and the firm will be \u201claser-focused\u201d on affordability as inflation puts pressure on the industry. That effort includes the launch of a new $5 meal deal for a limited time to make dining more affordable.\n\n\u201cWe heard our fans loud and clear \u2014 they\u2019re looking for even more great value from us, and this summer that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ll get,\u201d Erlinger said in a statement.\n\nWhile the stock doesn\u2019t seem to be a market darling at the moment, the company has been a staple for many income investors \u2014 and for good reason. Since paying its first ever dividend in 1976, McDonald\u2019s has increased its payout every single year.\n\nAlso worth noting is that McDonald\u2019s business doesn\u2019t solely depend on its own restaurant sales. In the U.S., 95% of its restaurants are franchises, allowing the company to earn substantial revenue from franchise fees. Additionally, McDonald\u2019s often owns the buildings at many of these locations, providing a steady income stream from rental payments.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nCar insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year \u2014 but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free) Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate \u2014 without the headache of being a landlord.

This may only be the start.\"\n\nChipotle (CMG)\n\nShares in Chipotle were higher in pre-market trading as investors are looking forward to see the 50-to-1 stock split trade when the Wall Street bell rings.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill announced back in March a stock split with one of the biggest multiples ever: Each current share will be split into 50 new shares.\n\nThis means that when markets open on June 26, shareholders will own 50 times as many shares as they did at the close of trading on June 25, but the price of each one will be about one-fiftieth of what it was before.\n\nShareholders who owned the stock as of the market close on June 18 received 49 additional shares for each one held. When the market opens Wednesday, shares will trade on a post-split basis, meaning one share worth $3,283.04 (\u00a32593.57) as of Tuesday's close will trade as 50 shares worth roughly $65.66 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nPre-split, Chipotle stock was the third-highest-priced in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nRivian (RIVN)\n\nShares in the EV maker were higher in pre-market trading following the announcement that Volkswagen (VOW3.DE) will invest up to $5bn into a partnership with it.\n\nThe German carmaker is trying to rapidly improve its software, and the partnership sent Rivian's shares up more than 37%.\n\nUpon agreement of a 50/50 joint venture, VW would receive \u201cimmediate access\u201d to Rivian\u2019s EV software for use in its own cars. The investment in Rivian and the joint venture amounts to $2bn in 2024 and up to $5bn by 2026.\n\nThe investment will provide Rivian \u2013 known for its flagship R1S SUVs and R1T pickups \u2013 the funding it needs to develop its less-expensive and smaller R2 SUVs that will roll out in 2026, the founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe, told Reuters.\n\nRead more: Pensioners \u00a3900 better off from tax and benefit changes\n\nThe resulting architecture developed between the two companies will find its way into vehicles in the second half of the decade, the two said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cThrough our cooperation, we will bring the best solutions to our vehicles faster and at lower cost,\u201d VW Group CEO Oliver Blume said.\n\nFedEx (FDX)\n\nFedEx shares soared more than 15% in pre-market trading after the company reported results that topped analysts\u2019 estimates in both earnings and revenue.\n\nThe Memphis-based company reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 31 of $1.47bn, or $5.94 per share, compared with $1.54bn, or $6.05 per share, a year earlier.\n\nRevenue rose to $22.1bn, up from $21.9bn a year earlier.

        "content": "It didn't make a sound. It didn't shake the ground. But after the market closed on Tuesday, one of the biggest stock splits ever took place.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) announced on March 19, 2024, that its board of directors approved a 50-for-1 stock split. On June 6, the restaurant operator's shareholders approved the split. Following the market close on June 25, all shareholders of record as of June 18 received 49 additional shares for every share they owned.\n\nWhat will happen now after Chipotle's massive 50-for-1 stock split? Here's what history shows.\n\nThrow out the history books?\n\nThe history of Chipotle's stock splits shows... nothing. Since the company's founding in 1993 and its initial public offering in January 2006, Chipotle had never conducted a stock split until this week.\n\nThroughout much of Chipotle's history, there wasn't a pressing need for a stock split. The Mexican restaurant chain's share price didn't rise above $1,000 until 2020. However, Chipotle stock skyrocketed over the last few years, including a gain of close to 40% in 2024 that pushed the share price above $3,000.\n\nChipotle Chief Financial and Administrative Officer Jack Hartung noted in March that the stock split \"comes at a time when our stock is experiencing an all-time high driven by record revenues, profits, and growth.\" The company's share price, revenue, and profits subsequently increased to even higher levels.\n\nReasons to expect a surge\n\nJust because Chipotle hasn't split its stock in the past doesn't mean we can't look at the broader history of stock splits. And there are reasons to be encouraged about what might happen next with Chipotle stock based on that history.\n\nBank of America's Research Investment Committee examined how stocks that split typically performed historically. This group found that stocks trounced the S&P 500 during the 12 months after announcing a stock split 25% to 12%.\n\nGranted, the outsized gains haven't been quite as big in recent years. Since 2010, the average 12-month return for stocks after announcing stock splits has been roughly 18% compared to 13% for the S&P 500, based on Statista's reporting of data compiled by BofA, Bloomberg, and Global Financial Data. However, stock-split stocks still beat the market.\n\nWhy has this been the case? Part of the reason why companies conduct stock splits is that they hope the lower share price attracts retail investors who remained on the sidelines when the share price was inordinately high. There could also be a self-fulfilling prophecy dynamic at play. Investors who expect a stock to rise after a stock split could be more inclined to buy the stock, contributing to buying pressure that pushes the share price higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nColor me skeptical\n\nHistory indeed seems to say that Chipotle stock could soar over the next several months. However, color me skeptical.\n\nFor one thing, Chipotle's share price has already risen close to 14% since the announcement of its stock split in March. That's not too far below the average increase of 18% since 2010 over the 12 months after a stock split announcement reported by Statista.\n\nAlso, trading fractional shares has become more widely available over the last seven years. This could reduce the positive impact of stock splits.\n\nMost importantly, though, Chipotle's valuation could be problematic. The stock trades nearly 60 times forward earnings. Neither the company's revenue nor earnings are growing briskly enough to warrant such a premium price. History usually isn't on the side of overvalued stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chipotle (CMG) investors will notice a difference in their portfolios this morning.\n\nThe burrito giant conducted a 50-for-1 stock split, the company's first split ever and one of the largest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nChipotle CFO Jack Hartung told investors he believes this will make shares more \"accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors\" on a call following the company's first quarter results.\n\nShareholders who owned the stock as of the market close on June 18 received 49 additional shares for each one held. When the market opens Wednesday, shares will trade on a post-split basis, meaning one share worth $3,283.04 as of Tuesday's close will trade as 50 shares worth roughly $65.66 per share.\n\nPre-split, Chipotle stock was the third-highest-priced in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), after NVR, Inc. (NVR) and Booking Holdings (BKNG). Its post-split stock price is still higher than when the company went public in 2006 at $22 per share.\n\nBernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo told Yahoo Finance that Chipotle could benefit from this split.\n\nOn one hand, this new entry point allows \"more access to retail investors\" who may have shied away from the high price prior to the split, Gargiulo said. But on the other hand, \"the stock could be exposed a little bit more to some level of volatility,\" he warned.\n\n\"I don't think it's ever going to be a meme stock, like GameStop or others in the past, but I think it does expose a little bit to more fluctuations,\" Gargiulo added.\n\nAs of Tuesday's market close, shares of Chipotle were up 43% year to date, compared to a nearly 15% gain from the S&P 500. A Chipotle restaurant stands in Manhattan on Feb. 6, 2024, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nSome Chipotle employees will reap the benefits of the split.\n\nApproximately 4,000 Chipotle employees, including restaurant general managers and crew members with more than 20 years of service, will receive a special one-time equity grant to commemorate the stock split, a Chipotle spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe grant will vest over three years. Additionally, US employees who have been with the company for one year can enroll in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which allows them to purchase shares at a discount. They also can elect to use between 1% and 15% of their compensation to help buy the stock.\n\nAnd Chipotle is not the only company conducting a stock split this year.\n\nAs Seana Smith reported following Nvidia's (NVDA) 10-for-1 stock split earlier this month, stock splits are typically bullish for companies that conduct them, with average returns one year later of 25% versus about 12% for the broader market, according to analysis from Bank of America.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart also recently conducted a 3-for-1 stock split. Since the stock split took effect on Monday, Feb. 26, shares of the retailer are up nearly 13%.\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Chipotle(NYSE: CMG) has long been the standard bearer for the fast-casual dining it helped pioneer. The company's focus on fresh ingredients prepared daily has revolutionized the industry and made Chipotle one of the biggest successes in it. Over the past year, the stock is up an impressive 60% (as of this writing), and that's no fluke. Over the past decade, Chipotle's revenue has jumped 157%, driving its net income up 226%. This performance has fueled its surging stock price, which has gained 450%.\n\nAs a result, its stock price currently sits above $3,250 per share, putting it beyond the reach of many everyday investors -- but there's change in the air. Chipotle's long-awaited 50-for-1 stock split went into effect after the market close on Tuesday, June 25.\n\nLet's review the details of this split and what investors can expect in the days and weeks to come. Image source: Chipotle.\n\nA quick review\n\nOn March 19, Chipotle management announced a 50-for-1 stock split, \"one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) history.\" The matter was subject to shareholder approval. The company subsequently secured that during its annual meeting, which was held on June 6. Chipotle noted at the time that \"shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of its common stock,\" an important milestone on the road to the split.\n\nThe stock split process commenced after the market close on June 25, and the stock began split-adjusted trading when the market opened on June 26. Shareholders were presented with 49 additional shares of Chipotle stock for each share they previously held. For each share of stock, at the current price of $3,250, investors should now have 50 shares priced at roughly $65 each. The timing can vary from brokerage to brokerage, so investors shouldn't be concerned if the newly minted shares don't appear immediately on the morning of June 26.\n\nWill the stock get a \"bump\"?\n\nSeasoned investors will note that a stock split doesn't affect the underlying business, but the process of a stock split generates a lot of excitement in the investing community, which is understandable. History suggests that the stocks in question tend to outperform the broader market in the year following a split.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Data tabulated by Bank of America Global Research showed that in the 12 months following a stock split announcement, companies generated returns of 25.4%, on average, compared to gains of 11.9% for the S&P 500.\n\nExperts suggest that the greater stock price gains aren't the result of the stock split itself, but rather the strong business and financial performance that fueled the stock price gains, which led to the split in the first place.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe study suggests that, on the heels of its stock split, Chipotle will likely continue to outpace the broader market.\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nThe company's streak of impressive growth continued when it announced its first-quarter results. Chipotle generated revenue of $2.7 billion, up 14% year over year, resulting in diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $13.01, up 24%. It's always encouraging to see profits grow at a faster rate than revenue, as this signals that the company has reached the scale necessary to leverage its existing assets, sending more income to the bottom line.\n\nChipotle's consistent growth is the fuel that has driven its stock price higher, and it appears the company has all the pieces in place to continue its upward trajectory. For the current year, management is guiding for revenue growth in the mid- to high-single-digit range while opening roughly 300 new restaurants, with 80% equipped with a Chipotlane.\n\nIt's worth noting that the company's Chipotlane strategy has been driving growth. These dedicated mobile order pickup lanes help reduce congestion at the checkout counter, which increases both sales and profit margins. It makes sense, then, that management is leaning into this strategy.\n\nThe subject of mobile ordering is also an important growth driver for Chipotle. The company had more than 36 million rewards members last year, who tend to be among Chipotle's most reliable customers. As a result, digital orders continue to grow faster than in-restaurant sales, amounting to 37% of food and beverage revenue in 2023.\n\nChipotle has several dozen international locations, and it has begun to expand its global presence. Furthermore, while Chipotle had 3,479 restaurants at the end of the first quarter, management is ultimately targeting 7,000 locations in North America. This, combined with a vast international opportunity, shows why Chipotle has a long runway for growth ahead.\n\nFinally, some investors might not find Chipotle's valuation to their taste. The stock is currently selling for 59 times forward earnings, compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. Taking a step back, however, helps provide perspective. Over the past decade, Chipotle stock is up 450%, compared to 180% for the S&P. For investors put off by the valuation, I'd suggest edging into the stock on any signs of weakness.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Upcoming Stock Splits to Add to Your 2024 Calendars Right Now",
        "content": "Trends come and go, but one in fashion again is stock splits. Two years ago, there was a frenzy of splits in the tech space. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and even Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) all split their stock. But then the phenomenon died down last year. Now, it seems to be rebounding \u2014 with a twist.\n\nWhile tech stocks are still splitting their shares (Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently split its shares 10-to-1), a lot of the upcoming stock splits are among more consumer discretionary stocks. It began earlier this year when Walmart (NYSE:WMT) split its shares 3-to-1. Uniform provider Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) will split its stock by a similar ratio in September and Sony (NYSE:SONY) will follow suit with a 5-for-1 split later this fall.\n\nThere are three more upcoming stock splits investors will want to keep an eye on, including one happening after the stock market closes today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough splits change nothing about a company, they offer positive signals about a company, and investors seem to like them. So, let\u2019s see if the three upcoming stock splits below are worth buying now at the higher price or if you should wait til they are more accessible.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first upcoming stock split is Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). Currently trading over $3,200, the Mexican food chain\u2019s stock will split by a whopping 50-to-1 after the closing bell today. Afterward, they will go for a more reasonable $64 a stub.\n\nChipotle is on a tear. Although shares slid 6% the other day, the restaurateur is still up 41% year-to-date and 57% over the past year. The stock has more than doubled over the past three years because business is booming.\n\nSales jumped 14% in the first quarter to $2.7 billion on a 7% jump in comparable restaurant sales. Operating margins widened 80 basis points (bp) to 16.3% from last year while restaurant-level margins expanded to 27.5% from 25.6% \u2014 a 190 bp gain.\n\nWall Street believes profits will keep flowing Chipotle\u2019s way. Analysts forecast earnings will grow long-term at a compounded annual rate of 22% as the restaurant chain is seen as a good exchange for value. At this point, you may as well wait for the split to take effect tomorrow to add it to your portfolio.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn just about two weeks, kitchen wares giant Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) will split its shares 2-for-1. The upcoming July 9 split will take WSM stock from just over $300 a share down to around $150 a share.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn announcing the halving event two weeks ago, the kitchen wares stock said the purpose is to make its stock more accessible to investors and employees. It is notable, though, that Williams-Sonoma stock has not really gone anywhere since it peaked at the end of March and the beginning of April. It actually trades 3% lower than it did three months ago, and even the split announcement did little to rally the stock.\n\nAlthough the company typically caters to a more upscale customer, which normally shields a business from the worst effects of inflation and high interest rates, the retailer is having trouble gaining traction. It had to reach out to more middle-income consumers who are feeling the pinch more.\n\nSales were down 5% in the first quarter on a similar percentage decline in comparable brand revenue. Over a two-year period, the comp is down 11% and off 1.4% over three years.\n\nDespite trading in the low triple digits, there doesn\u2019t appear much need for Williams-Sonoma to split its stock. And until its business shows the kind of traction signaling long-term growth, I wouldn\u2019t be a buyer before or after.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors have a little more time to think about Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which isn\u2019t set to split its stock until July 15. Currently trading at around $1,600 per share, the 10-for-1 upcoming stock split will put shares at a more attainable $160 each.\n\nIn March, I had anticipated the mobile device chip maker would announce an upcoming stock split even as it was trading about 16% lower than it is now. I noted at the time that \u201cBroadcom\u2019s network and server solutions for data centers are optimized for artificial intelligence (AI). That blends well with the AI chips it is developing as well. AI is a fast-growing business and generated $1.5 billion in revenue for the company last quarter.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Broadcom shifted its focus from mobile chipsets to data center infrastructure. It began building custom accelerators and is finding demand among hyperscalers growing.\u00a0In a bid to make its wares available to the widest possible customer base, the chipmaker is concentrating on the lowest power accelerators based on open standards.\n\nThere is no limit to its growth potential at the moment as it heads towards a trillion-dollar valuation. An investor could buy AVGO stock before or after the split and do well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In 2003, Chipotle issued its first Celebrity Card to Ozzy Osborne, who sang the praises of the fast-casual restaurant chain on his then-hit reality show. In the 21 years to follow, many other celebrities and superfans have been graced with the recognition. Now it\u2019s your turn.\n\nChipotle plans to give up to five customers their own Celebrity Card, which will give them access to one free meal a day at the restaurant as well as catering for up to 50 people once a year. Want in? You\u2019ll have to submit a video, photo, poem, essay, artwork, song, or other expression of your devotion to the chain, explaining why you deserve the card.\n\nFans can submit their application for the card through July 3 via TikTok, Instgram and Twitter/X, using the hashtag #CelebCardContest. Winners will be contacted on July 12.\n\nOne catch: The benefits of this particular Celebrity Card are only good for one year, not forever.\n\nThe competition was originally planned as a tie-in with LinkedIn, but high demand caused it to pivot to other platforms. Applications submitted via the LinkedIn form (which has been taken down) will still be counted as eligible entries.\n\n\"There's always been a special mystique around the Chipotle Celebrity Card,\" Chris Brandt, chief brand officer at Chipotle, said in a statement. \"We are expanding on what it means to be a Chipotle celebrity and relaunching the program to deepen our connections with our most devoted guests.\"\n\nChipotle has never really given a lot of visibility into how it chooses people to receive a Celebrity Card, much less the terms or perks that go with it. The company is regularly besieged by influencers and others who hope to get one, though, it says.\n\nThe company has managed to reverse its fortunes since 2018, becoming a favorite of Generation Z and Wall Street. On Tuesday, it will implement a 50-for-one stock split, which will bring shares from a lofty $3,241 to a more attainable $65 or so.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "As stock markets look to close off the first half of 2024, things could get a bit bumpier. With Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) correcting nearly 10% from its all-time high, the GPU maker is no longer the world\u2019s largest company at the time of writing. Despite the jitters in the hottest corners of tech, investors with a long-term time horizon shouldn\u2019t get into a panic over a bit of volatility.\n\nOf course, it can be easy to forget what it\u2019s like to have a bad week in the stock market if you\u2019re heavy on the red-hot semiconductor stocks. And though it\u2019s nerve-racking to even think about buying on dips in this kind of market, I do view bad days as good for long-term investors, many of whom may have criticized this market for being a tad on the expensive side.\n\nSo, whether or not stocks take a plunge to cool off for the summer, the following stocks seem worth keeping on the radar. They look quite cheap today but may become that much cheaper if we\u2019re on the cusp of a market-wide sell-off.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSalesforce (CRM) Salesforce (CRM) company logo seen displayed on smart phone. Salesforce Layoffs 2023\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) was slammed when it reported its latest quarterly earnings results, sparking one of the worst single-day sell-offs (of nearly 20%) in years. Indeed, CRM shareholders should be numb to such excessive post-earnings volatility by now. Fast-forward to today, and CRM stock\u2019s starting to gain again, now up 14% from its late-May post-earnings lows.\n\nIf it\u2019s not a quarterly disappointment, it\u2019s the announcement of an expensive acquisition. Though the enterprise software firm has been a roller-coaster ride, many analysts still view the recent dip as buyable. At 44.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), CRM stock hasn\u2019t looked this cheap in many months.\n\nWith Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently giving CRM stock the boot from its \u201cU.S. 1 List,\u201d there\u2019s a great deal of cloudiness surrounding the fallen cloud juggernaut as it looks to double down on the Data Cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) with Einstein. Though such efforts may not result in a timely turnaround, I do like the long-term foundation Salesforce is continuing to improve.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has been the envy of the quick-serve restaurant scene in recent quarters. With CMG stock starting to see its impressive parabolic rally begin to taper off, many investors may be wondering if it\u2019s time to book some profits in shares of CMG, something that billionaire investor Bill Ackman did earlier this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nLightening up a position after a 156% pop in two years is only smart, especially if the P/E multiple (currently at 68.4 times trailing) is higher than where it\u2019s been historically. Though the growth thesis is as sound as ever, the premium multiple entails a lot of expectation baked into the stock right here.\n\nThough shares have dipped over 6% from all-time highs, it may be wise to sit back and see how this one plays out as the firm runs into a 50-for-1 stock split while headlines surrounding portion sizes cause some to rethink their visit to the local Chipotle.\n\nFive Below (FIVE) storefront of a five below, FIVE Stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFive Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) is a discount retailer feeling the pinch amid inflation-induced changes in consumer behavior. Undoubtedly, the items Five Below sells are quite affordable. However, a huge chunk of what the firm sells is deemed as discretionary goods, which don\u2019t sell as well when times are tough and budgets are tight.\n\nAmid inflation, low-cost toys, games, candies, and all sort aren\u2019t exactly flying off shelves. Indeed, compared to other discount retailers, Five Below is leaning more on discretionary goods, leaving it sensitive to the state of the consumer. At writing, FIVE stock has lost 48% of its value since peaking in August 2021.\n\nAt 21.7 times trailing P/E, FIVE is a growth-focused retailer that I find could really start moving higher once inflation backs off further. As with most consumer discretionary plays, though, it can be tough to time an entry into the name, especially while it\u2019s in free-fall.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Salesforce.

        "content": "Growth stocks to buy on the dip have the potential to significantly outperform the stock market. Some of these assets can accumulate generational returns and get passed down to your heirs. However, these same stocks often experience declines on the way to new highs. Stock dips are common, and it\u2019s important not to panic.\n\nAccording to the Fear & Greed Index, panic may be setting in. The latest reading of 41 suggests that fear is partially driving the stock market, but not to a strong degree. When you invest in any asset, including stocks, you sign up for dips. These dips offer buying opportunities since they let you buy your favorite companies at discounts.\n\nKnowing which growth stocks to buy on the dip will leave you better prepared. Investor should narrow their search to companies that exhibit high revenue growth and rising profit margins. These are some of the growth stocks to buy on the dip to consider for long-term growth investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been a juggernaut in the cybersecurity industry. The firm continues to grow while its competitors cite headwinds as reasons for slower revenue growth. Crowdstrike reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 FY25 and closed out the quarter with $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue.\n\nCybersecurity will remain an essential service for many years. Businesses put a lot of their information online, and they also store customers\u2019 information in their databases. Hackers try to get into these databases and access a company\u2019s private files. Furthermore, the cyber criminals are using artificial intelligence to scale their attacks. This use of AI demonstrates how innovative technology can become dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands. Luckily, Crowdstrike is also upping its defenses with the help of artificial intelligence.\n\nCybersecurity is becoming a battle of AI vs. AI, and it\u2019s been beneficial for long-term investors. Crowdstrike stock has gained 54% year-to-date and is up by 427% over the past five years.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been crushing the stock market for many years as businesses rush to run advertisements and rank higher on the company\u2019s search engines. The stock has gained 29% year-to-date and has more than tripled over the past five years. A 28 P/E ratio and a strengthened focus on profit margins makes the stock attractive at current levels.\n\nWall Street analysts seem to agree with that assertion. Alphabet is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d with a projected 10% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $225 per share suggests that Alphabet can gain an additional 25%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost of the company\u2019s revenue comes from advertisements, but more than 10% of its revenue comes from cloud computing. Alphabet can continue to diversify its revenue with artificial intelligence and other initiatives. Overall revenue increased by 15% year-over-year in Q1 2024 while net income surged by 57% year-over-year. Alphabet wrapped up the first quarter with a 29.4% net profit margin.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been on a tear. Shares are up by 43% year-to-date amid a stock split and have gained 342% over the past five years. Higher prices haven\u2019t stopped Chipotle\u2019s customers from regularly buying food at its venues. Revenue increased by 14.1% year-over-year in Q1 2024 while net income was up by 23.2% year-over-year.\n\nChipotle should continue to grow its revenue and net income based on its recent expansion. The restaurant chain opened up 47 new restaurants with 43 of them including a mobile pickup drive-thru window. The company remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants this year. Comparable sales growth of 7% year-over-year indicates that many of its restaurants continue to generate traction, so growth isn\u2019t entirely reliant on the company opening up new locations.\n\nThe stock is currently rated as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d among 27 analysts with a projected 3% upside. The highest pre-split price target of $3,888 suggests a potential 21% gain from current levels.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) also has a lot of analysts behind it. The stock is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d and has a projected 6% upside. The highest price target of $593 per share suggests that Facebook\u2019s parent company can gain an additional 20%. The stock is up by 43% year-to-date and has gained 159% over the past five years. Meta Platforms trades at a 28.5 P/E ratio and is valued at $1.26 trillion.\n\nThe social media firm recently offered a dividend. Investors currently get a 0.40% yield, but shareholders should expect the company to maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. Profit margins are north of 30% as the company continues to refine its business model with a focus on efficiency.\n\nNet income more than doubled year-over-year in Q1 2024 while revenue still marched forward to the tune of a 27% year-to-date gain. Meta Platforms also has a healthy balance sheet which features $58.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) has been generating more buzz amid acquisition rumors. Alphabet has been rumored to be making an offer for several months, but now there\u2019s competition. An unnamed company appears to be in the mix for acquiring the $30 billion customer relationship management software firm.\n\nAlthough this speculation is helping the stock price, HubSpot hasn\u2019t needed the rumor mill to generate returns for investors. The stock is up by 6% year-to-date and has more than tripled over the past five years. Many businesses use HubSpot to communicate with their customers more effectively and increase their conversions. HubSpot has many monthly and annual subscriptions available which results in steady recurring revenue.\n\nHubSpot continues to report strong financials amid its recurring revenue model. Total revenue increased by 23% year-over-year in the first quarter to reach $617.4 million. GAAP net income came in at $5.9 million compared to a net loss of $36.6 million in the same quarter last year. Rising revenue and profit margins create a good opportunity even if an acquisition doesn\u2019t pan out. However, an acquisition can result in a surging stock price and one last hurrah for investors before a big tech firm adds the company to its product mix.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) has more than one million customers in various industries. The firm provides business supplies, safety equipment and other resources for businesses. Cintas generates steady revenue from its customers since many businesses need supplies and safety equipment in order to function properly. A lack of safety equipment can bring production to a halt and make them non-compliant.\n\nCintas has been outperforming the stock market for several years. Shares are up by 20% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years. The $72 billion firm trades at a 49 P/E ratio and offers a 0.76% yield. Cintas has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years and has raised its dividend for more than 40 consecutive years.\n\nA high dividend isn\u2019t the only positive attribute for this stock. Cintas reported solid financials, including 9.9% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 FY24. Net income jumped by 22.0% year-over-year to reach $397.6 million.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc.

Shares are up by 21% year-to-date and have soared by 370% over the past five years. The corporation has a $93 billion market cap and trades at a 66 P/E ratio.\n\nSynopsys has been in business for more than 35 years and generates over $5 billion in annual revenue. The company\u2019s chips are used in self-driving cars, machine learning devices, 5G technology, and other devices. Synopsys also generates revenue from its software which results in healthy profit margins.\n\nThe firm reported 15% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 FY24 which was at the high-end of guidance. Net income increased by 7% year-over-year. Synopsys closed out the quarter with a 20.1% net profit margin.\n\nWall Street is optimistic about SNPS, and believe it is one of the growth stocks to buy on the dip that has more room to run. It is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 10 analysts and has a projected 7% upside. The highest price target of $675 per share suggests that the stock can gain an additional 10%.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, GOOG, and SNPS.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill's 10-for-1 Stock Split Is Imminent: 10 Things You Need to Know",
        "content": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) and the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are widely credited with lifting the major stock indexes to record levels, it can be argued that stock splits are the hottest trend on Wall Street right now.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. Since 2024 began, nine top-notch businesses have announced and/or completed a split. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock splits come in two varieties -- forward and reverse -- with investors decidedly favoring the former. Forward-stock splits are designed to make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, while a reverse-stock split aims to increase a company's share price to ensure it meets the minimum listing standards of a major stock exchange, or perhaps has a high enough share price to attract attention from institutional investors and mutual funds.\n\nAfter watching retail kingpin Walmart and AI titan Nvidia complete their respective 3-for-1 and 10-for-1 forward splits, it's time for fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) to join this elite stock-split club. With its stock split imminent, here are the 10 things you need to know.\n\n1. Chipotle's forward split is historic\n\nOn March 19, Chipotle's board of directors announced a 50-for-1 forward split, which marks one of the largest nominal stock splits for any company in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. This split, which was approved by the company's shareholders earlier this month, with increase the outstanding share count by a factor of 50 while lowering the share price to 1/50th of its value.\n\n2. It'll become effective following the closing bell\n\nWhen I said Chipotle's stock split is \"imminent,\" I wasn't exaggerating. The effective date for its 50-for-1 split is after the close of business today, June 25. Before trading begins on June 26, Chipotle's share price will be reduced to 1/50th of what it closes at today.\n\nKeep in mind that it's not uncommon for online brokers to take up to 24 hours to recognize that a stock split has taken place. If you're a Chipotle shareholder, don't panic if you notice a sizable (but incorrect) unrealized loss during the morning hours of June 26.\n\n3. Stock splits are purely cosmetic\n\nAlthough stock splits are all the rage on Wall Street right now, they're purely cosmetic. Altering a company's share price and outstanding share count doesn't impact its market cap or operating performance. Whatever market cap Chipotle Mexican Grill ends with on June 25 will be precisely what it's worth on a post-split basis just prior to the start of trading on June 26.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. Chipotle's employees are a prime catalyst behind its stock split\n\nSomething you might not realize is that Chipotle's first stock split in more than 18 years as a publicly traded company is being undertaken for its employees just as much as retail investors. The company wants to encourage its workers to participate in its employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), which'll be far more enticing when shares of the company trade closer to $64 instead of $3,200.\n\nWalmart's 3-for-1 split was also enacted to encourage workers to participate in the company's ESPP.\n\n5. The company is enjoying exceptional pricing power\n\nSince pricing its shares at $22 for its initial public offering (IPO) in January 2006, Chipotle's stock has increased by more than 14,000%! One of the reasons the company has been such a phenomenal investment is because its management team realized early on that consumers would willingly pay more for its food if it used responsibly raised meats, prepped its food daily in its restaurants, and sourced its vegetables locally (when possible). This exceptional pricing power has helped fuel Chipotle's sustained outperformance. Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill.\n\n6. Having a limited menu is a ticket to success in the restaurant industry\n\nAnother catalyst behind Chipotle's historic 50-for-1 forward split is the company's limited menu. Shunning the idea that \"bigger is better,\" Chipotle's management team has stuck to a relatively small menu, which helps to maximize food prep efficiency and keeps lines moving quickly in its restaurants.\n\nFurthermore, having a smaller menu helps Chipotle generate a lot of buzz when it does introduce a new food item.\n\n7. Innovation has been a key growth driver\n\nThe company's innovation has played a key role in its greater-than 14,000% return since pricing its IPO in 2006. Beyond just introducing a new food item every now and then, the company made waves with its addition of dedicated mobile order drive-thru lanes, which it calls \"Chipotlanes,\" beginning in 2018. Chipotlanes are what helped the company thrive during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n8. Stock-split stocks outperform the broader market\n\nThe reason investors flock to stock-split stocks is because they historically run circles around the broader market. Between 1980 and the present, data from Bank of America Global Research shows that the average company enacting a forward split has returned 25.4% in the 12 months following its stock-split announcement. By comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 has delivered an 11.9% average return over the same timeline.\n\n9. Billionaire investors have a mixed view of Chipotle's stock\n\nEven though stock-split stocks have history on their side, and Chipotle has leaned on a number of competitive advantages to grow its earnings per share, Wall Street's brightest money managers are mixed on what the future holds for this top-performing fast-casual restaurant chain.\n\nBased on Form 13F filings that detail first-quarter trading activity, billionaires Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors, John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments, and Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International were all buyers of Chipotle stock.\n\nMeanwhile, activist investor Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management, Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management, and Israel Englander of Millennium Management all reduced their fund's respective positions ahead of the company's imminent stock split. CMG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n10. Chipotle's stock is exceptionally pricey (and a split doesn't change that)\n\nLast but certainly not least, Chipotle Mexican Grill's valuation makes absolutely no sense -- and a 50-for-1 stock split isn't going to change that. While there's no question that the company deserves a valuation premium for continually out-innovating and out-executing other fast-casual restaurant chains, Chipotle's same-store sales growth of 7% during the first quarter doesn't come close to meriting a multiple of 58 times forecast earnings this year or a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 48.\n\nOnce the stock-split euphoria surrounding Chipotle wears off, don't be surprised if its stock undergoes a sizable correction.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle's 50-for-1 Stock Split Is Coming. Here's What Investors Need to Know",
        "content": "High-profile stock splits are en vogue, it seems. Just days after Nvidia split its shares 10-for-1, Broadcom announced it would follow suit. In fact, several big names are choosing to split theirs this summer. After Nvidia's stock split, maybe the most anticipated is fast-casual restaurant pioneer Chipotle (NYSE: CMG).\n\nShares of Nvidia are up about 10% since it executed the split on June 7. Can Chipotle investors expect a similar bump in stock price? Let's consider a few basics first.\n\nHere's how Chipotle's split will work and what it might mean\n\nA stock split, or more specifically a forward stock split, in this case, is when a company issues new stock to shareholders, increasing the number of shares on the market. The shares then begin trading at a lower price. It's done proportionately so that the total value of an investor's portfolio doesn't change.\n\nSo in the case of Chipotle's 50-for-1 split, each shareholder will be issued 49 additional shares for every share they own after the market closes on June 25. They now have 50 times the shares they had before. However, they aren't suddenly 50 times richer; rather, when markets open the next day, shares are 50 times cheaper than the day before.\n\nSo the move itself doesn't affect the value of a portfolio directly, but it can affect it down the line. Lowering the price removes a barrier to many retail investors to afford shares of the stock, allowing for more volume and money in the market. This certainly has the potential to positively affect the stock price, but not necessarily. Don't count on this as a guarantee that just because Nvidia's stock rose after the split, Chipotle's will rise too.\n\nBesides, this is short-term thinking; don't get lost trying to time the market. Instead, focus on the value of the company long-term.\n\nSo is Chipotle a good long-term play?\n\nChipotle is smoking its peers in growth\n\nThere are a lot of options in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) market. Chipotle has to compete with players like McDonald's and Yum!, the owner of chains like KFC and Taco Bell. Over the last few years, Chipotle has grown revenue at a seriously impressive pace. Look at the difference in this chart. CMG Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nAnd the strong growth has been consistent even through tough times in the larger market. In 2020, the year restaurants were hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, Chipotle still managed to grow revenues by more than 7%. McDonald's shrank revenue by more than 10% in the same year. Showing that it is resilient and agile in times of crisis is not something to take lightly; it speaks to the company's solid leadership.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis growth looks to be continuing. The company is expecting to raise its earnings per share (EPS) by about 53% for 2024 compared to 2023. That's about four times the growth McDonald's expects.\n\nThere are some reasons to be cautious\n\nChipotle certainly has a lot going for it, and its growth can't be denied. However, there are some aspects of the business that don't look quite as rosy. The incredible revenue growth has been largely driven by the expansion of locations. If you look at comparable-store sales, the company saw a 7% increase for Q1 2024, or about half the top-line growth for the same period.\n\nIts stock is also valued significantly higher than McDonald's and Yum! in relation to its current earnings. Investors are counting on its growth to continue to justify the valuation. If this growth is disrupted or begins to cool off, suddenly that premium might not look so justified.\n\nEven with this in mind, I still think Chipotle is a good bet over the long term. Keep an eye on that comparable-store growth, however. That's the number the company will need to be able to drive when it isn't opening so many stores.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Disruptor Stocks to Buy and Hold for Great Long-Term Potential",
        "content": "There are industries that come and go when it comes to investor fancy. The one thing that appears timeless is the appeal of disruptors. Find a company shaking up a stodgy industry, and there's money to be made if you're right and, ideally, early.\n\nSome of the disruptors I think offer long-term potential include Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) and Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC). Let's take a closer look at both of these companies that reinvented their stodgy industries. There is still upside to be had at today's price points for entirely different reasons.\n\n1. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThere was a time when there was practically nothing between fast food and casual dining to satisfy the hungry. Chipotle championed fast-casual, a format that delivered casual dining eats with the convenience of fast food. Sure, chains including Subway and Panda Express had the assembly line concept down before Chipotle. Others like Panera take a little more time on the prep but still put out table-service-quality eats. Chipotle is the one that put it all together with a \"food with integrity\" mantra that resonates with its growing fan base.\n\nChipotle is huge now. There are now 3,479 locations, but Chipotle expects to more than double that store count in North America alone. It's also not afraid to continue innovating. When it saw digital sales take off on this side of the pandemic crisis it made it easier to utilize a second assembly line in the back of the restaurant to piece together the growing number of takeout orders without inconveniencing walk-in traffic like other concepts are doing. Drive-thru lanes have been around in the restaurant industry since the 1940s, but Chipotle is now incorporating its cleverly titled Chipotlanes to most of its new openings to make it easier for customers and third-party delivery app drivers to get their food. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAs big as Chipotle has grown over the years, it keeps finding ways to deliver stellar returns. The stock is up 57% over the past year, and has more than quadrupled over the last five years. Double-digit revenue gains continue, including three consecutive quarters of 14% top-line growth. Expansion stacked on top of healthy comps can keep those gains coming. The story gets even better on the bottom line with at least 36% growth in earnings for each of the last three years.\n\nChipotle has tried and failed to grow out sister concepts, but reality has shown that it doesn't need a second act. The namesake chain is all it needs. Chipotle stunned the market with its success, and the imitators have followed. Don't let this week's upcoming 50-for-1 stock split distract you. This is a top-shelf restaurant stock and disruptor that continues to raise the bar-bacoa.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Teladoc\n\nLet's go from a disruptor that everyone loves in Chipotle to one that investors are steering clear of: Teladoc. The pioneer of telehealth has a proven platform where folks can check in with a medical specialist online for a growing number of concerns and conditions. It's just struggling to connect with patients and the market right now.\n\nThe stock hit another eight-year low late last week. The shares are now down a stunning 97% since peaking in early 2021. Put another way, this would be a 30-bagger if it got even close to its earlier all-time high.\n\nThe good news is that Teladoc has a healthy 91.8 million virtual care members on its platform. That's about it for the good news. Revenue growth has decelerated sharply for 12 consecutive quarters, a run that began following a 151% year-over-year increase on the top line and has fallen all the way to a 3% uptick in its latest report.\n\nUsage is going the wrong way. Year-over-year visits have declined the past few quarters despite the gradual rise in its membership base. Losses continue, but it is generating positive and growing free cash flow and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nThere is no denying that this is a risky situation. Even though Teladoc's balance sheet is flush with cash to ride things out in the near term, it needs to start growing again. Telemedicine and telehealth make too much sense to fail, and newer companies are gaining market share at Teladoc's expense. A saving grace here could be a change at the top. Its longtime CEO stepped down in April, and an outsider was brought in to take over earlier this month. The current diagnosis may not be encouraging, but with the suppressed share price and large membership base, the upside is high whether Teladoc figures things out or is acquired by an opportunistic player at a reasonable premium.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Walmart, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Motorola and Bank of America",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 24, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Walmart Inc. WMT, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, Motorola Solutions Inc. MSI and Bank of America Corp. BAC.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Must-Buy S&P 500 Stocks at 52-Week Highs with Room to Run\n\nU.S. stock markets have maintained their northbound journey in the first half of 2024 after an impressive 2023. The three major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 have gained a respective 3.8%, 15.4% and 20% year to date and 1.2%, 4.7% and 5.9% month to date.\n\nOn Jun 20, Wall Street\u2019s broad-market index \u2014 the S&P 500 \u2014 achieved a milestone breaching the key technical barrier of 5,500 for the first time in history. The benchmark recorded an all-time high of 5,505.35, before closing at 5,473.17. The S&P 500 Index has posted 32 record-highs so far this year.\n\nFavorable Macroeconomic Scenario\n\nAfter showing stickiness in the first quarter, various measures of inflation have once again shown favorable data in recent months. Peak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient.\n\nThe global supply-chain system has been restoring slowly since last year as U.S. corporate behemoths are rescheduling their supply-chain system\u2019s bypassing of China. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain firm despite record-high inflation and interest rate.\n\nOn Jun 12, in his post-FOMC meeting statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated one rate cut of 25 basis points this year and a full 1% cut in 2025. The performance of high-growth sectors like technology and interest rate are inversely related. Thus, a low interest rate regime will boost this sector.\n\nMeanwhile, several S&P 500 stocks are currently at 52-week highs. Investment in these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should be fruitful in the near future.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our selection to five S&P 500 stocks currently trading at 52-week highs. Despite a decent rally, these stocks still have more room for growth over the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA Corp. reported blockbuster first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues of $26.04 billion, up a whopping 262% year over year, and marking the third straight quarter of growth in excess of 200%. Adjusted earnings per share were $6.12 compared to $1.09 a year ago. NVDA expects sales of $28 billion in the fiscal second quarter, above the current consensus estimate of $26.6 billion.\n\nNVDA expects its next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, to be its upcoming driver. These chips will be available in data centers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. On Jun 2, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called \u201cRubin.\u201d\n\nThe Rubin architecture will have new GPUs to launch AI systems, CPUs and networking chips. It will also have new features like a central processor called \u201cVera\u201d. Rubin is set to be introduced in 2026.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 92.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nWalmart Inc. has been gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. WMT has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nWalmart\u2019s strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled WMT\u2019s first-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.2% and 9%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Inc. is benefiting from its digital efforts, Chipotlane add-ons and marketing initiatives. This along with strength in digital sales and new restaurant openings, has been driving CMG. Also, a strong comparable restaurant sales growth bodes well.\n\nFor 2024, CMG anticipates comps growth in the mid to high-single-digit range, driven by its transaction growth and strong comps growth trends. CMG intends to focus on the stage-gate process and leverage digital programs to expand access and convenience.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Chipotle Mexican Grill has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 23.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nMotorola Solutions Inc. expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products, and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. In addition, MSI is likely to benefit from a record backlog, which further exemplifies the strength of its portfolio.\n\nMSI expects a healthy growth momentum in the near term owing to solid demand trends. Consequently, MSI has raised its earlier guidance for 2024 with improvement in both operating segments.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Motorola Solutions has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.1% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nBank of America Corp.\u2019s net interest income (NII) will likely be positively impacted in the current high-rate regime. We expect NII to fall slightly in 2024 and then rise in 2025 and 2026. BAC\u2019s opening of financial centers in new and existing markets and improved digital capabilities will support its top line.\n\nWe project total revenues of BAC to grow 2.3% this year. While capital market activity has improved of late, the challenging macroeconomic environment might once again weigh on the investment banking business.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Bank of America has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.8% and 9.4%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best tech stocks to own amid the rising demand for artificial intelligence, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is already enjoying the returns on its investment. The company\u2019s timely investment in OpenAI and the integration of ChatGPT into its products and services helped boost the revenue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI believe Microsoft is only moving upwards from here. It is already up 19% year to date. Analysts are bullish on the stock and believe the company will beat expectations in the upcoming quarterly results. In the\u00a0recent quarter, Microsoft saw an impressive 31% year-over-year jump in the cloud segment including Azure.\n\nMicrosoft is one of those stocks to buy and hold for the next generation.

One of the largest e-commerce companies, Amazon also holds the largest market share in the cloud and generated a revenue of $143.3 billion, up 13% in the first quarter from a year ago. Its operating income tripled to $15.3 billion.\n\nIts diversified business shields it from the market\u2019s ups and downs, and it has seen impressive growth in the advertising segment. Marketers have understood the importance of investing in Amazon advertising, and as the economy improves, we could see a higher revenue growth rate in this segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts North American and international business segment saw impressive growth throughout the quarter, and the upcoming summer holiday season could lead to a surge in e-commerce sales.\n\nUp 23% in 2024, AMZN stock is heading to $200 very soon. With Amazon Web Services roaring higher in the industry, the company is a global giant with a strong runway.\n\nWalmart (WMT) A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has come a long way over the past six decades. It has seen it all: the market ups and downs, a pandemic, war, and inflation. However, the company stood the test of time and in the past five years, WMT stock is up 83% and 28% so for in 2024.\n\nWalmart attracted consumers with its low-cost products, which has helped improve sales and profits. In the\u00a0first quarter, it saw a 5.8% revenue growth and a 21% jump from a year ago in the e-commerce segment.\n\nOne solid reason to invest in Walmart stock is management\u2019s commitment to keeping pace with the massive competition. It is investing in the e-commerce segment and a subscription service that has gained high popularity.\n\nThese investments are also paying off. Walmart has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating from 25 TipRanks analysts with an average price target of $73.12. The stock also offers a dividend of 1.2% and recently hiked the dividend by 9%.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most valuable biotech companies in the world right now, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is gaining massive popularity due to its successful weight loss drug. The company\u2019s drug, Ozempic, led to a significant revenue surge and the stock is up 450% in the past five years.\n\nThe anti-obesity market\u00a0will keep growing throughout the decade, and this is where Novo Nordisk is set to benefit. Investors are concerned about the rising competition in the industry but one thing to remember is that Novo is one of the first companies to develop and market the drug.\n\nThis gives it an early-mover advantage and it enjoys high trust from the industry. It reported a 28% jump in the net profit in the first quarter, following which the management raised the outlook for the year.\n\nNVO stock is very close to the 52-week high of $144 but\u00a0it\u00a0could keep moving upwards. It is up 38% so far this year and there is no stopping its momentum. Yes, competitors are working on oral weight loss drugs but that may take time and until then, Novo Nordisk will keep leading the market.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nA long-term buy and hold, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) stock is up 42% in 2024. Priced at more than $3,000 per share, the stock isn\u2019t cheap but\u00a0it is\u00a0a brilliant blue-chip stock to add to your portfolio. It recently expanded in the Middle East and has signed the first franchise agreement for restaurants that will open in Kuwait.\n\nThe company saw a 14.1% year-over-year revenue jump in the first quarter and a 7% rise in comparable sales growth. This led to a 23.2% increase in net income. The company is also working on expansion plans and opened 47 new restaurants in the quarter.\n\nChipotle is an incredible stock with massive upside potential. One reason to buy the stock is the 50-for-1 stock split. It will start trading post-split basis from June 26.\n\nThe company enjoys pricing power and has reported impressive performance despite inflation.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Picture of a person laying on a couch holding a mobile phone that features the Netflix (NFLX) logo on the screen\n\nSource: Alex Ruhl / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is ruling the market.\n\nThe stock is up 44% so far this year, and as one of the biggest streaming companies, Netflix has a long runway and\u00a0I believe it\u00a0will keep moving upwards.\n\nThe company is making significant revenue from advertising and has recently announced that it is\u00a0moving into malls. Netflix has announced its locations for the first two Netflix House venues. It will be an experiential entertainment space set to open next year.\n\nOnly time will tell if the locations will be profitable, but they represent another potential line of revenue through them.\u00a0Netflix enjoys a first-mover advantage in the industry and generates enough cash flow to keep investing in new content.\n\nIt puts in a lot of effort to ensure that there is fresh and content available for viewers. Its password crackdown decision has also paid off, and the company saw a\u00a015% jump in revenue and a 54% jump in the operating income in the first quarter.\n\nWith Netflix, there is a lot more to come.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock market\u2019s favorite tech stock, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a solid buy after the stock split. This\u00a0is one stock that\u00a0will keep you in the green for a very long time. The stock is up 171% this year and is steadily moving upwards. Having hit new highs after the quarterly results, the management announced a 10-for-1 stock split, making it easier for investors to accumulate this industry darling.\n\nOne solid reason to buy NVDA stock is the unprecedented demand for AI chips. With organizations and governments adopting AI, Nvidia will continue to see steady demand. Its revenue numbers\u00a0are proof\u00a0that the company is one of the best in the industry.\n\nToday, it is the most valuable company in the world, passing Microsoft. It is taking the S&P 500 to new highs and made several investors rich. In the first quarter, its data center revenue soared 427% from a year ago to $22.6 billion.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Blackwell chip has brought about a new era of computing, and I believe this will help the company generate higher revenue. NVDA is a solid long-term buy and hold regardless of the market situation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, investors have pretty much always had a new innovation or trend to latch onto. Next-big-thing technologies like the internet, genome decoding, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse represent some of the examples of potentially game-changing trends for corporate America.\n\nAt the moment, investors have two buzzy trends that they're flocking to. While you're probably familiar with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), you might be unaware of just how popular stocks enacting splits have become.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to change its outstanding share count and share price by the same magnitude without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Splits come in two forms: forward and reverse.\n\nWith a forward-stock split, a company is decreasing its share price to make it more nominally affordable for retail investors and perhaps its employees. Conversely, the purpose of a reverse-stock split is to increase a company's share price, usually to ensure it meets the minimum listing standards on a major stock exchange. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMost investors are focused on the former. That's because companies conducting forward-stock splits often have high-flying stocks that are a direct result of out-innovating and out-executing their peers. Since 2024 began, eight high-profile companies have announced or completed forward-stock splits.\n\nAccording to a study from Bank of America Global Research, companies conducting forward-stock splits have averaged a 25.4% return (since 1980) in the 12 months after their split is announced. That compares to an 11.9% 12-month return for the benchmark S&P 500 over the same timeline.\n\nDespite this promising long-term data, not all stock-split stocks are worth buying. There are two \"Class of 2024\" stock-split stocks I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole.\n\nNvidia\n\nDespite finishing June 18 as the largest publicly traded company in the world, I want absolutely nothing to do with AI leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split on May 22, which was completed following the closing bell on June 7.\n\nShares of Nvidia have risen by more than 800% since 2023 began -- a nearly $3 trillion increase in market value -- because its graphics processing units (GPUs) have quickly become the standard in AI-accelerated data centers. Semiconductor analysis company TechInsights recently noted that Nvidia accounted for 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped in 2023.\n\nThe seemingly insatiable demand for AI-GPUs has worked in Nvidia's favor, too. The laws of economics state that if the demand for a good or service outpaces supply, the price of that good or service will increase until demand tapers. Nvidia has been able to substantially increase the price of its prized H100 GPUs, which sent its adjusted gross margin soaring to 78.4% in the first fiscal quarter (ended April 28).\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile there are plenty of reasons for Nvidia's shareholders to be thankful, there are also numerous warnings that Wall Street's hottest stock-split stock is in a bubble.\n\nFor starters, we haven't seen a next-big-thing investment for at least 30 years that's avoided an eventual bubble-bursting event. Regardless of how promising the technology, innovation, or trend, investors always overestimate the adoption of anything that creates buzz on Wall Street. With no company being aided more by the rise of AI than Nvidia, an AI bubble-bursting event would, presumably, hurt its stock the most.\n\nI think it's fair to say that competition is also a problem. While optimists are quick to point out that Nvidia's GPUs have a compute advantage over other AI-GPUs, the issue is more of a numbers game than a concern about performance. Nvidia can't meet all of its orders, which opens the door for external competitors to steal share.\n\nAs I've previously pointed out, this competition is internal, as well. Nvidia's four top customers, which account for around 40% of its net sales, are members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" The problem is that these four Magnificent Seven constituents are developing AI-GPUs for their own data centers. Even if these chips are used purely as a complement to Nvidia's H100 GPU, it suggests that we're witnessing a peak in reliance on Nvidia's data center hardware.\n\nThe valuation is pretty terrifying, too. Although Nvidia isn't ridiculously expensive, based on its price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio), the company's trailing-12-month price-to-sales ratio of 42 equates to the peak levels seen with Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the dot-com bubble bursting. If history rhymes, Nvidia's stock may eventually plunge by more than 50%. Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe second stock-split stock I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole right now is none other than fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board announced a 50-for-1 forward split on March 19, which was approved by shareholders at the company's annual meeting earlier this month. This mammoth stock split will become effective after the closing bell on Tuesday, June 25.\n\nJust because I want nothing to do with Chipotle doesn't mean the company hasn't performed well from an operating standpoint. The company's management team realized a long time ago that consumers will pay more for higher-quality food. This is why Chipotle aims to source its vegetables locally, when possible, as well as uses only responsibly raised meats.\n\nChipotle's limited menu also explains its long-term success. By purposely keeping its menu small, the company ensures that food preparation is efficient and guests are served quickly. Further, new food innovations get more pop with such a small menu.\n\nBut at some point, the company's valuation no longer makes sense -- and we've certainly hit that point, in my view.\n\nFollowing a nearly 15,500% increase in its shares since its $22 initial public offering price in January 2006, Chipotle is trading at 62 times forecast earnings for 2024, and 51 times forward-year earnings. Even with Wall Street forecasting an annualized earnings growth rate of 22% through 2028, things don't make sense.\n\nThough Chipotle's mid-teens sales growth probably sounds impressive given the company's already large scale, its revenue growth isn't quite as spectacular if you dig a bit deeper. Comparable restaurant sales during the first quarter grew by 7%, with new store openings making up the remainder of its growth. This 7% comparable-store growth was derived from a 5.4% increase in transactions and a 1.6% increase in check size.\n\nWhile 7% comparable-store sales growth is impressive in the fast-casual restaurant industry, it doesn't merit a forward P/E ratio of 51, especially when some of this increase is the result of inflation pushing prices higher.\n\nI'll also add that there's only so much innovation that Chipotle can squeeze out of its business. The addition of mobile-order drive-thru lanes (\"Chipotlanes\"), as well as the introduction of an occasional new menu item, have moved the needle -- but not enough to command this much of a valuation premium.\n\nI'll be looking for Chipotle Mexican Grill's stock to meaningfully pull back after its stock-split euphoria wears off.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle's Stock Split Happens This Week. Here's What to Expect.",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) is doing something it's never done before in its 30-year history. The company is splitting its stock, with the operation scheduled for this week. The decision came after the shares soared in the triple digits over the past few years, reaching beyond $2,000 last year and past $3,000 this year.\n\nThe reason for such enormous gains? This fast-casual restaurant has reported quarter after quarter of growth -- even excelling during early pandemic days thanks to its digital ordering system -- and has built a brand that keeps customers coming back. Now, the stock split will bring the per-share price of this high-flying stock down, making it more accessible for a broad range of investors.\n\nLet's take a look at what to expect -- and consider whether this restaurant giant is a buy. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy launch a stock split?\n\nFirst, a few points about stock splits in general. These operations involve issuing more shares to existing shareholders to lower the price of each individual share. They are purely mechanical and don't change a company's market value, the value of your holding, or the valuation of the stock. This means they don't serve as a catalyst for stock performance -- investors won't rush out to buy a stock just because it's announced a stock split.\n\nThat said, a stock split is generally positive for a company over time because it makes it possible for investors who want to make a small purchase to do so without relying on fractional shares. And these operations also suggest a company is optimistic about its future, with the idea that the stock, from its new level, can once again take off.\n\nThe new share price is determined by the ratio of the split, and this brings me to the subject of the Chipotle operation. In one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange history, Chipotle will offer current holders 49 shares for every one share they own. Shareholders will receive the shares after the June 25 market close, and the stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis as of the market open on June 26.\n\nConsidering Chipotle's price today -- about $3,214 -- the price following this 50-for-1 stock split will be about $64.\n\nThough the record day to benefit from the split was on June 18, if you buy the stock prior to the split's completion, don't worry -- the right to the extra shares transfers from the seller to you when you make the purchase.\n\nChipotle's earnings growth\n\nSo, by midweek, Chipotle's per-share price will make the stock an easier buy, but otherwise, the investment opportunity will remain the same as it was prior to the stock split. Now let's consider if this top restaurant stock is a buy. No one can say Chipotle hasn't been successful when it comes to growing earnings and widening margins -- over time, the company has done this well.\n\nStory continues CMG Operating Margin (Annual) Chart\n\nCMG Operating Margin (Annual) data by YCharts\n\nAnd it's done all of this while expanding. Last year, Chipotle opened 271 new restaurants, and more than 85% of them are equipped with a digital order pickup window called a Chipotlane. This keeps the company on track to reach its long-term goal of 7,000 restaurants in North America, more than double today's number. Chipotle also aims to reach $4 million in average unit volumes (AUV), or the average sales each location generates, up from about $3 million currently.\n\nMeanwhile, Chipotle customers keep returning thanks to the restaurant's promise of fresh and healthy products and its focused menu. This helped the company report double-digit revenue growth to $2.7 billion in the most recent quarter, and gains in earnings per share and operating margin.\n\nThe valuation problem\n\nAll of this sounds fantastic, but the one problem with Chipotle is its valuation. The company trades for 57x forward earnings estimates, well surpassing valuations of McDonald's and Yum! Brands. They trade for about 20x. I would expect Chipotle to trade at a premium to these fast-food giants -- but not by such a great degree.\n\nSo, is this stock split stock a buy? This depends on your investment style. Chipotle's business has proven its strength over time, and the company has room for expansion in North America and even internationally. This could boost earnings well into the future.\n\nFor long-term investors favoring growth, Chipotle stock still could deliver solid returns, so you may think about opening a small position in the restaurant giant to diversify your portfolio -- the post-split price offers you the ability to do this more easily. But, considering the stock's steep valuation, value investors may find tastier opportunities elsewhere.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle and Cava Are Market Darlings. These 2 Other Differentiated Restaurant Chains Could Follow Similar Paths.",
        "content": "Burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) and Mediterranean concept Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) are undeniably stock market darlings in the restaurant industry. Over the past year, Chipotle's shares are up 70%, and Cava's are up by a whopping 150%. Investors are simply enthused with what they see.\n\nThere's good reason for that enthusiasm. Their businesses are both doing remarkably well, and investors can measure the success from multiple angles.\n\nIt's hard to earn hefty profits in the restaurant space, but this duo does it better than most. At the restaurant level, Chipotle had an operating margin of almost 28% in the first quarter of 2024, and Cava's margin was 25%.\n\nMoreover, both are consistently growing in popularity, as measured by same-store sales (comps) growth. In the first quarter, Chipotle's comps grew 7%, and Cava's grew 2%, continuing the long-term trends for both businesses.\n\nChipotle and Cava are also somewhat differentiated in the restaurant space -- burritos and falafel aren't your typical burgers and fries. And perhaps this differentiation has helped these chains open up new locations at rapid paces. In 2023 alone, Chipotle opened 271 new locations, and Cava opened 72.\n\nHowever, if there's any legitimate argument against buying these two stocks now, it's that they trade at expensive valuations. Both are at all-time-high price-to-sales (P/S) ratios -- 9 for Chipotle and 13 for Cava, both of which are quite lofty for restaurant stocks. CMG PS Ratio Chart\n\nIf you appreciate the growth and profits that those two companies deliver, but wish you could invest in them at more attractive valuations, then you should take a look at Kura Sushi(NASDAQ: KRUS) and Gen Restaurant Group(NASDAQ: GENK). These restaurant chains share the attractive qualities of Chipotle and Cava but are far more reasonably priced today.\n\n1. Kura Sushi\n\nThere are over 500 Kura Sushi locations in Japan owned by its parent company, making it one of the largest sushi chains in that country. But in the U.S., Kura Sushi is quite small, with only 59 locations as of Feb. 29 (the end of its fiscal 2024 second quarter). However, it plans to open 13 to 14 new U.S. locations this year, and management has set a goal of 400 locations over the long term. Relative to its size today, those are huge plans.\n\nKura Sushi uses tech such as food-carrying conveyor belts, robots that bring diners their drinks, and toy-dispensing machines at the tables. Management calls this model \"eater-tainment,\" and believes this draws people to discover the brand. It seems to be working considering that fiscal Q2 comps grew by 3%, and fiscal 2023 comps grew by almost 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring its fiscal 2023, Kura Sushi's locations did nearly $4.3 million in sales volume on average -- higher than either Chipotle or Cava. And thanks to this high sales volume, its restaurant-level operating profit margin was 20% as of the second quarter.\n\nTherefore, it seems like Kura Sushi is growing in popularity, has good restaurant financials, and has enough differentiation to stand out and grow substantially. And trading at a P/S ratio of 4.5, its valuation is half that of Chipotle and far cheaper than Cava.\n\n2. Gen Restaurant Group\n\nIf Kura Sushi is small at 59 locations, then Gen Restaurant Group is really small -- its Gen Korean BBQ chain has only 40 locations. But again, this California-based company believes it can quickly expand. It expects to open at least eight locations this year, at least 10 next year, and around 15 in 2026.\n\nIn other words, the chain expects to nearly double in size over the next three years. And it thinks it can have more than 250 locations long term.\n\nWith Korean barbecue, diners cook their food themselves at the table. Gen Korean BBQ offers unlimited food at set prices, which can contribute to guest satisfaction.\n\nAnother interesting thing about this company is that it designs and installs its own ventilation systems for its tabletop grills. This keeps costs lower and increases the speed at which it can grow: It's not waiting on specialized third-party providers to build out a restaurant.\n\nGen Korean BBQ's first-quarter comps were down almost 2%, but I don't believe this is reason for concern. The restaurants do close to $6 million in annual sales volume on average, which is really high. There are natural limits on how a location's high sales volume can be, and since sales are so high already, it's logical for comps to look weak even though its restaurants are still packed full of diners.\n\nBut Gen Korean BBQ might be able to boost its sales volume a little more. The company just launched a new premium menu that includes items such as Wagyu beef at a higher price point. Perhaps some of its customers might be enticed to pay more for the higher quality.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive feat for a company this small is that Gen Korean BBQ is already profitable. Investors can expect profits to ebb and flow at this stage of its business, but in 2023, the company had $11 million in net income for a profit margin that was greater than 6% -- and that's before making any helpful accounting adjustments.\n\nIncluding both classes of Gen Restaurant Group stock, it has a market capitalization of just over $300 million. This means that it trades at less than 2 times sales -- even cheaper than Kura Sushi.\n\nThe stocks of Gen Restaurant Group and Kura Sushi both have cheaper valuations than Chipotle or Cava.

        "title": "2 Magnificent Growth Stocks That Have Outperformed the Nasdaq in 2024 and Can Keep Soaring",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite has delivered a total return of approximately 20% since the start of 2024, and some companies have notably outpaced these returns in share-price performance. However, the performance of any stock in a single year should never be the sole reason you decide to buy or sell.\n\nInstead, there should be a clear business thesis that underpins any stock you buy, and the company should align with the overall growth goals and risk tolerance levels that you've set for your personal portfolio. On that note, if you're looking for stocks that are already soaring this year and have intriguing businesses to drive long-term growth, here are two names to consider the next time you go stock shopping.\n\n1. Netflix\n\nNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) is trading roughly 40% higher from the start of 2024. The streaming giant was one of the pandemic darlings that subsequently met the ire of investors as growth slowed and profitability waned. But it has returned to steady gains after this period of difficulty.\n\nWhile Netflix saw its market share decline in recent years due to increased competitiveness in the space, it still controls about 20% of the streaming market in the U.S., at the time of this writing. However, the company is still the top streaming platform in the world.\n\nThe company makes most of its money from recurring subscriptions. Its recent launch of an ad-based tier for a cheaper monthly rate also introduced advertising revenue into the mix. The company makes some additional revenue through partnerships with providers and other entertainment entities.\n\nNetflix's efforts to crack down on password sharing, diversify its revenue streams, and give more options to subscribers breathed new life into its balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue rose 15% year over year to $9.4 billion, while operating income jumped 54% to $2.6 billion. The company ended the quarter with 269.6 million global streaming memberships, a healthy 16% increase from the same quarter in 2023.\n\nNetflix is working on growing its member base and making its platform more advertiser-friendly. Ads membership grew 65% sequentially in the first quarter of 2024 following sequential hikes of around 70% in the prior two quarters. The company's ad-based tier appears to be widely popular: In markets where this tier is available, 40% of signups are for the ads plan.\n\nIn addition, the company is cash-flow positive, bringing in free cash flow of around $2.1 billion in the most recent quarter alone.\n\nNetflix is still a powerhouse in the streaming space. The continued innovation of its content and methods of delivering that content to subscribers are enabling solid growth after a difficult time of transition. Investors might want to stay along for the ride or start a position in this top streaming stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) has seen shares rocket about 47% from the beginning of this year as the strength of its underlying business has drawn investors to take a slice of the action. The stock has been in the news for numerous reasons lately, including its record upcoming 50-for-1 stock split.\n\nThis will be one of the largest splits in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Shareholders of record as of June 26 will own a stake of Chipotle that's valued at the same amount as prior to the split, but the price of each share will be approximately one-50th of what it was before the split happened. Looking at it another way, as of June 26, shareholders will own 49 additional shares for each share they held before the split.\n\nStock splits don't impact the value or market capitalization of a company but do increase the number of outstanding shares while decreasing the cost of each share. This can make a stock that has gotten quite expensive much more accessible for investors.\n\nChipotle has a unique model in the fast-casual space in that it doesn't franchise any of its locations. Instead, all locations are owned and operated by the company. Its business model is simple: It derives revenue from sales through its restaurants and continues to leverage various competitive factors to expand its business moat, including fresh ingredients from quality sources, a relatively small menu, reasonable prices, and a growing digital presence.\n\nIn 2023, 37% of its food and beverage revenue came from digital sales. Total revenue last year came to just shy of $10 billion, a 14% increase from 2022.\n\nChipotle opened 271 new restaurants last year, and most had Chipotlanes, its newer drive-through locations that allow customers to order online and pick up the order from the comfort of their vehicles. Total profits for the 12-month period came to $1.2 billion, a 37% increase from the prior year.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, total revenue rose 14% year over year to $2.7 billion, while net income rose 23% to $359 million. Restaurant-level operating margins were 27.5% in the quarter, up 190 basis points year over year.\n\nThere's a lot to like about this stock, its simple business model, and the continued value proposition to the end consumer. While Chipotle's shares are about to become much more accessible after the stock split, this looks like a top restaurant stock to buy and hold for the long haul that can deliver generous returns in the years ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Netflix wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Restaurants were hit hard by the one-two punch of high inflation and interest rates. The former caused chains to raise their prices, deterring customers from visiting. And the latter raised their borrowing costs, making it more expensive to operate.\n\nAccording to the market researchers at Circana, although restaurant traffic grew 1% last year from 2022, it remains down 8% from pre-pandemic levels. However, total dollars spent is up 12% from then, suggesting rising prices are playing a role in rising sales.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association says 2024 is shaping up a little differently. Its Restaurant Performance Index declined 0.4% in April (the latest data available) and was down to 98.8, the lowest level since the pandemic. Fewer than 40% of operators think their sales will be higher in six months, and only 10% see the economy improving.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, the twin pressures don\u2019t hit the same everywhere. Some restaurant chains are thriving. Below are three restaurant stocks to buy now. They withstood the rigors of the pandemic and thrived in the environment that followed. More importantly, each offers the prospect of additional growth to come.\n\nDutch Bros (BROS) A Dutch Bros coffee shop representing BROS Stock.\n\nSource: Alexander Oganezov / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of drive-thru coffee shop Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) are up 8% since going public in September 2021. But it\u2019s not a new startup. The java joint has been in business since 1992 and has perfected its growth strategy.\n\nThe company is in expansion mode, opening 45 new locations in the first quarter. It markets the 11th consecutive quarter where it opened 30 or more stores. Dutch Bros plans to open as many as 165 locations this year and recently moved into its 17th state. That leaves it with significant room for additional expansion but right now is focusing on its \u201cfortressing\u201d strategy.\n\nFortressing is a term popularized by Domino\u2019s (NYSE:DPZ) and consists of flooding a market with new stores to build mindshare with consumers while lowering marketing costs. Although individual stores may see lower sales than they otherwise would, total revenue to the company rapidly increases.\n\nBut Dutch Bros is seeing strong growth at all of its coffee shops, enjoying 10% increases in same-shop sales. In fact, they outweighed the significant investments the chain made in labor costs.\n\nBROS stock is up 25% in 2024. With Wall Street forecasting, the coffee slinger will grow earnings at a better-than-25% compounded annual rate for the next five years. Look for Dutch Bros to perk up your portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrinker International (EAT) A photo of a Chili's restaurant sign, owned by Brinter International (EAT).\n\nSource: James R. Martin/ShutterStock.com\n\nChili\u2019s and Maggiano\u2019s Little Italy owner Brinker International (NYSE:EAT) is a surprise pre- and post-pandemic star. EAT stock is up 22% over the last three years but 79% higher over the last five. Although the restaurant operator is seeing sales rise across the board, its Tex-Mex food chain Chili\u2019s is the biggest moneymaker for the company.\n\nFiscal third-quarter sales for the brand rose 3.8% to $988 million, representing 89% of total revenue. The figures also include Brinker International\u2019s virtual kitchen, It\u2019s Just Wings. Maggiano\u2019s had a less than 1% bump in sales to $120.5, or 11% of the total. EAT owns, operates or franchises more than 1,600 restaurants across the U.S. and 27 countries.\n\nAlso, the restaurant operator has been able to grow sales and traffic ahead of the industry through a combination of menu innovation and value. For example, it added a new half-pounded burger called The Big Smasher that was offered for a limited time at under $11 that highlighted its everyday value platform.\n\nAt the same time, Brinker International eliminated items like its Double Lunch Burger that removed a \u201cskinny burger\u201d stock keeping unit (SKU) from the menu. Offering customers a thicker single burger is a better option for cash-strapped consumers than two thin burgers.\n\nBrinker International stock is up 62% so far this year. Although shares are not offered at a deep discount since they trade at 20 times free cash flow, they are still reasonable. And, EAT goes for a reasonable 15 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates and just a fraction of its sales.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn that same vein of good food at a great price, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is the third restaurant stock to buy now. The fast-casual chain has been a rocket and shows no signs of letting up.\n\nShares are up 47% in 2024, have more than doubled over the past three years and stand 358% higher than where they were five years ago. Although CMG currently trades hands for more than $3,400 a share, the Mexican food chain will be effecting a 50-for-1 stock split. That will promise to position the stock at a more attainable $68 a share, unless it climbs higher.\n\nThere is a good reason to bet it will. Sales rose 14% in the first quarter to $2.7 billion on a 7% jump in comparable restaurant sales. Operating margins widened to 16.3% from 15.5% a year ago. Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s restaurant-level operating margin expanded by 190 basis points to 27.5%.\n\nMoreover, Wall Street forecasts it will keep growing earnings at 22% a year long-term as price, value and the trend in favor of Mexican food marches forward. That suggests this is a restaurant stock to buy now for your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "U.S. stock markets have maintained their northbound journey in the first half of 2024 after an impressive 2023. The three major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 have gained a respective 3.8%, 15.4% and 20% year to date and 1.2%, 4.7% and 5.9% month to date.\n\nOn Jun 20, Wall Street\u2019s broad-market index \u2014 the S&P 500 \u2014 achieved a milestone breaching the key technical barrier of 5,500 for the first time in history. The benchmark recorded an all-time high of 5,505.35, before closing at 5,473.17. The S&P 500 Index has posted 32 record-highs so far this year.\n\nFavorable Macroeconomic Scenario\n\nAfter showing stickiness in the first quarter, various measures of inflation have once again shown favorable data in recent months. Peak inflation is far behind us. The labor market remains resilient.\n\nThe global supply-chain system has been restoring slowly since last year as U.S. corporate behemoths are rescheduling their supply-chain system\u2019s bypassing of China. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain firm despite record-high inflation and interest rate.\n\nOn Jun 12, in his post-FOMC meeting statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated one rate cut of 25 basis points this year and a full 1% cut in 2025. The performance of high-growth sectors like technology and interest rate are inversely related. Thus, a low interest rate regime will boost this sector.\n\nMeanwhile, several S&P 500 stocks are currently at 52-week highs. Investment in these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should be fruitful in the near future.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our selection to five S&P 500 stocks currently trading at 52-week highs. Despite a decent rally, these stocks still have more room for growth over the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA reported blockbuster first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues of $26.04 billion, up a whopping 262% year over year, and marking the third straight quarter of growth in excess of 200%. Adjusted earnings per share were $6.12 compared to $1.09 a year ago. NVDA expects sales of $28 billion in the fiscal second quarter, above the current consensus estimate of $26.6 billion.\n\nNVDA expects its next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, to be its upcoming driver. These chips will be available in data centers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. On Jun 2, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called \u201cRubin.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Rubin architecture will have new GPUs to launch AI systems, CPUs and networking chips. It will also have new features like a central processor called \u201cVera\u201d. Rubin is set to be introduced in 2026.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 92.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nWalmart Inc. WMT has been gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. WMT has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nWalmart\u2019s strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled WMT\u2019s first-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.2% and 9%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG is benefiting from its digital efforts, Chipotlane add-ons and marketing initiatives. This along with strength in digital sales and new restaurant openings, has been driving CMG. Also, a strong comparable restaurant sales growth bodes well.\n\nFor 2024, CMG anticipates comps growth in the mid to high-single-digit range, driven by its transaction growth and strong comps growth trends. CMG intends to focus on the stage-gate process and leverage digital programs to expand access and convenience.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Chipotle Mexican Grill has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 23.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nMotorola Solutions Inc. MSI expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products, and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. In addition, MSI is likely to benefit from a record backlog, which further exemplifies the strength of its portfolio.\n\nMSI expects a healthy growth momentum in the near term owing to solid demand trends. Consequently, MSI has raised its earlier guidance for 2024 with improvement in both operating segments.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Motorola Solutions has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.1% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nBank of America Corp.\u2019s BAC net interest income (NII) will likely be positively impacted in the current high-rate regime. We expect NII to fall slightly in 2024 and then rise in 2025 and 2026. BAC\u2019s opening of financial centers in new and existing markets and improved digital capabilities will support its top line.\n\nWe project total revenues of BAC to grow 2.3% this year. While capital market activity has improved of late, the challenging macroeconomic environment might once again weigh on the investment banking business.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Bank of America has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.8% and 9.4%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy Before Their Upcoming Stock Splits",
        "content": "If you\u2019re looking for stocks to buy before their stock splits, there are many things you need to keep in mind. Firstly, you should keep the fundamentals and valuations in mind before you dive in before a stock split. A stock split alone is unlikely to yield massive returns, and a lot of the news is priced in when the split is announced. That said, stock splits have caused a notable short-term price increase but also a decrease immediately after the stock split. Thus, you should do your own due diligence, as normal with any company that is about to undergo a stock split.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t screen for stock split stocks. When a company does a stock split, it usually means they are seeing a lot of bullish momentum, likely correlated to strong fundamentals and a rosy outlook going forward. As such, these stocks could deliver strong returns going forward, and I\u2019ll be discussing seven of these stocks in this article.\n\nCintas (CTAS) A hand reaches for an article of clothing on a hanger from a rack labeled XL.\n\nSource: christinarosepix / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) provides corporate identity uniforms and related business services. The company is riding high on several megatrends and tailwinds across its well-diversified business segments. I believe Cintas stock remains one of the most consistent and stable in the market, having gained an impressive 27% over the past six months to reach $711 as of writing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nManagement is making smart moves to keep this momentum going, including the recently announced 4-for-1 stock split. Shareholders of record on September 4, 2024, will receive three additional shares for each share held, with distribution set for after market close on September 11, 2024. While the stock is quite expensive at current levels, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it climb even higher post-split if the company continues exceeding expectations.\n\nCintas delivered robust Q3 FY2024 results, with revenue growing 9.9% to a record $2.41 billion and diluted EPS surging 22.3% to $3.84. This stock split could further energize its trajectory here.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading semiconductor company that designs and develops a wide range of products. In Q2, Broadcom\u2019s revenue soared 43% year-over-year to $12.5 billion, driven by the VMware acquisition and the AI boom. Excluding VMware, organic revenue still jumped an impressive 12%, largely thanks to AI revenue skyrocketing 280% to $3.1 billion.\n\nI believe Broadcom is one of the best-positioned chip stocks to ride the AI and data center megatrends. By serving semiconductor companies rather than the end market directly, Broadcom insulates itself from intense competition while still benefiting from the broader chip demand surge. That said, there is significant China exposure here that could keep the stock depressed if geopolitical troubles fire up more.\n\nStory continues AVGO revenue by region. Stocks to buy\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThis unique position has propelled the stock to a stunning 108% gain over the past year. With Broadcom trouncing Q2 revenue estimates by nearly 4% and the upcoming stock split poised to attract more investors, I\u2019m bullish that this chip leader has plenty of room to run. If you\u2019re looking for a high-conviction way to play the AI and data center gold rush, Broadcom looks like a compelling buy ahead of its 10-for-1 stock split on July 12.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) operates a chain of fast-casual restaurants specializing in Mexican-inspired cuisine. The company\u2019s Q1 report posted 7% comp sales growth driven by over 5% transaction growth. Restaurant numbers are also growing fast. Chipotle operated restaurants chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nRestaurant stocks have been on a tear lately, and Chipotle is no exception. Its stock has climbed nearly 372% over the past year. Despite its lofty $3,420 price tag, I think the upcoming 50-for-1 stock split on June 25 will make CMG shares more attractive to a broader range of investors.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that Chipotle trades at a significant premium compared to other restaurant businesses. I would be cautious about expecting substantial medium-term gains. Nonetheless, the long-term potential here looks very bullish to me.\n\nBarrett Business Services (BBSI) A photo of a businesswoman pointing at charts on a piece of paper on a table.\n\nSource: kan_chana/ShutterStock.com\n\nBarrett Business Services (NASDAQ:BBSI) provides business management solutions for small and mid-sized companies. I believe BBSI is well-positioned to capitalize on the megatrends of automation and a strong labor market.\n\nThe company reported gross billings increased 7% YOY in Q1, driven by an 11% increase in worksite employees from new client additions. This proves that businesses are outsourcing HR functions to focus on their core competencies. BBSI\u2019s client retention also continues to trend better than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWhile the company reported a quarterly loss of 2 cents per share, analysts expect BBSI to be solidly profitable for all of 2024. The stock has surged 53% over the past year and is trading at a premium valuation relative to its business size. However, BBSI has announced a 4 for 1 stock split. The new shares will be distributed on June 21, 2024, and trading will resume on a split-adjusted basis on June 24, 2024.\n\nL\u2019Air Liquide (AIQUY) Factory pipes and towers at sunset\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAir Liquide SA (OTCMKTS:AIQUY) is a French multinational company that supplies industrial gases and services to various industries worldwide. I believe AIQUY is one of the most solid long-term stocks you can buy right now. This is the sort of stock you buy and let compound for many years or even decades.\n\nAIQUY operates in a stable industry with consistent demand, which has helped it deliver steady returns over the years. While it may not offer explosive growth, the upcoming 11-10 stock split on June 24 could boost the compounding effects for long-term investors.\n\nMoreover, Air Liquide\u2019s 1.74% dividend yield sweetens the deal for income-oriented investors. AIQUY remains a top pick for investors seeking a reliable, long-term compounding machine.\n\nUnited States Lime & Minerals (USLM) Macro of silver\n\nSource: Phawat / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnited States Lime & Minerals (NASDAQ:USLM) manufactures lime and limestone products. USLM stock has been soaring higher than most expected, and I\u2019d say the near-term potential would be muted if it wasn\u2019t for the upcoming 5:1 stock split on July 15. Prices have been supported by underlying fundamentals, but a cooldown in profitability could throw it off track. USLM price vs EPS chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, USLM\u2019s revenues grew 7.4% to $71.7 million as higher selling prices offset lower sales volumes. Gross profit surged 27.6% to $30.6 million on those price increases and lower costs like cheaper natural gas. Net income jumped 31.2% to $22.4 million or $3.92 per share.\n\nWhile construction demand fell, it was partially offset by higher industrial demand. Management expects construction to pick back up going forward. With alternative assets gaining popularity and USLM\u2019s strong bottom line growth, I think it\u2019s a long-term buy that could deliver more dividend hikes ahead.\n\nHowever, opinions are mixed on the stock. The 5-for-1 stock split should drive near-term interest, but investors should still be cautious. I\u2019m bullish long-term as USLM rides these megatrends.\n\nSony Group Corporation (SONY) Sony logo on the side of a building at its offices in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is a global leader in consumer and professional electronics, gaming, entertainment, and financial services. I believe Sony\u2019s stock is a compelling buy ahead of its upcoming 5-for-1 stock split in October, as the company is riding several powerful megatrends that should drive long-term growth.\n\nIn the gaming segment, Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 console is seeing robust demand, with nearly 60 million units sold to date. Hit games like Hell Divest 2 are shattering sales records, while the company\u2019s aggressive studio acquisitions like Bungie are fortifying its content pipeline.\n\nBeyond gaming, Sony is capitalizing on the explosive growth in streaming entertainment through its music and video platforms. The company\u2019s imaging sensors are also poised to benefit from the proliferation of cameras in smartphones, EVs, and IoT devices.\n\nWith sales hitting a record 13 trillion JPY and operating income surging to 1.2 trillion JPY in fiscal 2023, Sony\u2019s financials are expanding impressively. I expect these tailwinds to keep Sony\u2019s stock on an upward trajectory. That said, you should keep an eye on Japan\u2019s currency devaluation before you make a decision on whether or not you want to buy SONY.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks to buy offer stability now and steady financial growth for the future. These corporations are household names\u00a0that are\u00a0likely to rise in the long run. While stocks carry more risk than leaving your money in the bank account, these same investments are also\u00a0likely\u00a0to keep up with inflation and generate more returns than the interest you would have made from the bank.\n\nInvestors can opt for an index like the\u00a0S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite, but it is possible to outperform both\u00a0of these benchmarks. Investors can look within indices and ETFs to discover how to outperform them. Some stocks in any fund or index perform better than others, and focusing on the winners can lead to outsized gains.\n\nThe blue-chip stocks to buy now on this list are all profitable and\u00a0are reporting\u00a0rising financials.\u00a0They have competitive moats within their industries and\u00a0look poised to gain more\u00a0market share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a\u00a0reasonably\u00a0valued Magnificent Seven stock that is exhibiting solid growth rates. The $2.2 trillion company trades at a 27.5 P/E ratio and\u00a0comes with\u00a0a 0.45% yield.\u00a0Shares are up by 27% year-to-date (YTD) and have more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nThe tech firm achieved 15% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in the\u00a0first quarter of 2024. Net income surged by 57% YOY amid the company\u2019s cost-cutting initiatives. Alphabet\u2019s profit margins stand to expand considerably as the firm further trims its costs and places a stronger focus on the bottom line.\n\nAlphabet recently initiated its first quarterly dividend which currently stands at 20 cents per share. Wall Street is bullish on the stock and analysts have rated it\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0\u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The average price target suggests a 13% upside. People will continue to use Google and YouTube to consume information, and Google Cloud is penetrating the cloud computing industry. Alphabet looks like one of the most promising blue-chip stocks to buy now.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently became the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded corporation. The AI boom is still\u00a0going\u00a0strong, and many big tech companies are rushing to buy Nvidia\u2019s chips. The stock\u00a0is currently rated\u00a0as a\u00a0\u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 41 analysts. It\u2019s easy to see why analysts are optimistic about the stock. Shares are up by 171% YTD and have gained more than 3,350% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe corporation continues to boast incredible revenue and earnings growth as AI tailwinds\u00a0continue to\u00a0propel the stock.\u00a0Revenue increased by 262%\u00a0YOY\u00a0in\u00a0Q1 2025 while net income was up by 628%.\n\nNvidia has generated plenty of additional attention since leadership announced a 10-for-1 stock split. The stock split doesn\u2019t impact Nvidia\u2019s value, but it makes options trading more accessible which should increase volatility. The overall sentiment is bullish\u00a0at the moment, so increased options trading can result in higher prices.\u00a0Nvidia has a pristine balance sheet and net profit margins that regularly exceed 50%\u00a0due to AI tailwinds.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another online advertising giant that\u00a0knows how to\u00a0grab people\u2019s attention and convert it into cash. Shares are up by 44% YTD and have soared by over 160% over the past five years as Mark Zuckerberg continues to roll with a year of efficiency.\n\nThe company more than doubled its net income\u00a0YOY\u00a0in\u00a0Q1 2024 and recently initiated a dividend program. Meta Platforms reduced its headcount by 10%\u00a0YOY\u00a0to 69,329 employees. The firm also reported 27%\u00a0YOY\u00a0revenue growth.\n\nMeta Platforms has 3.24 billion daily active users across its social networks. That\u2019s a 7% YOY improvement. A steady stream of new users allows Meta Platforms to display more ads and generate additional revenue. The company is also working on some AI initiatives that can become viable business segments\u00a0in the future. Meta Platforms has a healthy cash position of $58.12 billion and used $14.64 billion to repurchase shares this quarter. Meta Platforms also gave out $1.27 billion to investors as dividends.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) among the undervalued blue-chip stocks to buy now that looks like a bargain compared to other credit and debit card issuers. The stock trades at a 19 P/E ratio and offers a 1.22% yield. American Express regularly raises its dividend by 10% or more each year and hiked\u00a0its dividend\u00a0by 17% earlier this year. Shares have gained 22% YTD and are up by 84% over the past five years.\n\nThe fintech firm reported strong earnings in the\u00a0Q1 2024, which indicates that the company\u2019s multi-year growth plans are working. Revenue increased by 11% YOY while net income was up by 34%. Those growth rates translated into a net profit margin of 16.9%.\n\nOne of the\u00a0positive tidbits from the\u00a0recent results was that more than 60% of new accounts came from Millennials and Gen Z consumers.\u00a0Blue-chip stocks to buy must now win over new generations to stay relevant and reward long-term investors too. American Express\u2019 ability to do just that suggests a bright future.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) generates annual recurring revenue from its membership program and plenty of sales from its wholesale locations. The company offers affordable products that will always generate demand in good and bad economic cycles. Costco\u2019s May sales results demonstrate that people\u00a0are spending\u00a0more money with the wholesaler. Total revenue increased by 6.4% YOY while e-commerce sales\u00a0were up\u00a0by 15.3%. Growth rates were similar if investors excluded the impacts of changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange rates.\n\nCostco is a top pick\u00a0in Wall Street that is\u00a0currently rated as a\u00a0\u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\u00a0The stock has received a few upgrades lately, including a high of $960. This price target suggests that Costco can gain an additional 10% from current levels. Costco has\u00a0certainly\u00a0delivered plenty of upside for its investors. The stock has gained 34% YTD and has soared by 227% over the past five years.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) closed out 2023 with\u00a0am ambitious goal, open\u00a0285-315 restaurants in 2024. The Mexican Grill chain started the year by opening 47 new restaurants in Q1 2024. Chipotle announced that it remains on pace to hit its full-year restaurant goals. Most of Chipotle\u2019s new locations are coming with mobile order pick-up windows, called Chipotlanes, which have helped the company manage more orders and generate additional sales.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only good news cooking for Chipotle stock. Revenue increased by 14.1% YOY to reach $2.7 billion as higher prices didn\u2019t stop people from visiting their local Chipotle. Net income jumped by 23.2% YOY, resulting in a 13.3% net profit margin.\n\nInvestors\u00a0are gathering\u00a0around to buy Chipotle before the stock goes through a 50-for-1 split. The stock has gained 43% YTD and is up\u00a0by\u00a0342% over the past five years. Shares currently trade at a 73 P/E ratio. Chipotle\u00a0is currently rated as a\u00a0\u201cModerate Buy\u201d\u00a0among 27 analysts. None of them gave Chipotle a \u201cSell\u201d rating.\n\nWaste Management (WM) Image of green Waste Management (WM) branded truck in the foreground and building with Waste Management flag in the background.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nWaste Management (NYSE:WM) provides an essential service\u00a0for commercial, industrial and residential clients.\u00a0The company picks up waste\u00a0and gets it out of\u00a0local communities, corporate buildings and other locations.\u00a0Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock and have given it a consensus\u00a0\u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating. Shares have a projected 7% upside based on the average price target. That projected gain is in addition to Waste Management\u2019s 16% year-to-date gain. Shares have also been up by 79% over the past five years and have a 34 P/E ratio.\n\nThe company reported solid earnings that suggest the rally is here to stay. Revenue increased by 5.5% YOY in\u00a0Q1 2024 while net income was up by 32.8%. Waste Management recorded a 13.7% net profit margin to wrap up the quarter.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Is Selling Shares of 1 of Wall Street's Hottest Stock-Split Stocks. Should You Follow Suit?",
        "content": "If there's one thing Wall Street doesn't lack, it's data. Between earnings season and monthly economic data releases, it can be easy for investors to get overwhelmed and miss something important.\n\nRoughly five weeks ago, during the heart of earnings season, what's arguably the most important data release of the quarter occurred. I'm talking about the May 15 deadline for institutions to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F offers investors an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the quarter ending March 31).\n\nAs you can imagine, investors tend to pay the closest attention to what Wall Street's brightest billionaire investors are doing. This includes Pershing Square Capital Management's Bill Ackman, who oversees more than $10 billion of invested assets for his fund. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nUnlike most billionaire investors, who oversee investments in dozens or hundreds of stocks, Ackman has historically run a tightly knit portfolio of a half-dozen to one-dozen holdings. He puts his fund's capital to work in businesses he believes are undervalued, and usually builds a large enough stake to earn board seats and/or influence the strategic direction of the companies he's betting on. In many ways, Ackman can be considered an activist investor.\n\nAs of March 31, Pershing Square Capital Management had stakes in six companies and seven securities (Ackman's fund owns both classes of Alphabet's stock). But the most-surprising move of the first quarter is Ackman selling nearly 10% of Pershing Square's stake in its largest (20.1% of invested assets) and longest-held position: Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG).\n\nThis sizzling stock-split stock is on deck\n\nThe 81,014 shares Ackman's fund sold of fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle during the March-ended quarter reduced Pershing Square's remaining stake to 743,984 shares. Based on Chipotle's nearly $3,428 closing price on June 18, this position is currently worth a whopping $2.55 billion.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's stock has been doing so well that, on March 19, its board announced its first-ever stock split. A \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count without impacting its market cap or operating performance. In Chipotle's case, it's conducting a 50-for-1 forward-stock split, which will increase its share count by a factor of 50 and reduce its share price to 1/50th of its value the day it goes into effect (after the closing bell on June 25).\n\nStory continues\n\nNext to artificial intelligence (AI) colossus Nvidia, which completed a 10-for-1 stock split on June 7, Chipotle is one of the most-anticipated and hottest stock-split stocks on Wall Street.\n\nThe more than 15,000% increase in shares of Chipotle since pricing its initial public offering at $22 in January 2006 is primarily the result of management understanding its customer base, keeping things simple, and allowing its innovation to do the talking.\n\nWith no freezers in its restaurants, Chipotle has stuck to its promise of prepping its food daily, using only responsibly raised meats, and sourcing its vegetables locally, when it makes financial sense to do so. Just as grocery stores capitalized on organic food demand in the 2000s, Chipotle's management team has realized that consumers will pay a premium for higher-quality food.\n\nThe company's menu has also remained rather small throughout the years. Limiting the menu is done on purpose to ensure quick meal preparation and shorten wait times in the company's restaurants.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle has been Chipotle's innovation. While there's only so much that can be done with food-based innovation, the company began leaning on mobile order-dedicated drive-thru lanes (known as \"Chipotlanes\") in 2018. These Chipotlanes became a key source of revenue that propelled the company's growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe three probable reasons Ackman is selling shares of Chipotle\n\nWhat's compelled one of Wall Street's most-successful billionaire investors to dump nearly 10% of their stake in Chipotle?\n\nTo begin with, Bill Ackman and his investment team might simply be locking in some gains after a phenomenal run for their top holding. Since the start of the third quarter of 2016, shares of Chipotle have returned 770%. Although we don't know exactly what Pershing Square's cost basis is in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Ackman's fund appears to be sitting on an unrealized gain of more than $2 billion.\n\nYou might recall that Warren Buffett recently pared down Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple with the reasoning that tax rates are liable to rise in the future. It's possible that Ackman shares a similar view and wanted to lock in a bit of profit. This type of selling is relatively benign.\n\nA second reason Ackman may have sent 81,014 shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill to the chopping block is the lack of insider ownership and buying activity. Insiders own a very small percentage of outstanding shares, and the vast majority of insider transactions involve the exercising of options and the selling of shares. If insiders aren't willing to buy shares of their own company's stock, why should you? CMG Insider Ownership Percentage Chart\n\nThe caveat to this point is that insider selling isn't always bad news. For instance, executing options and selling to cover a tax bill isn't a red flag for investors. Nevertheless, there's only one reason insiders buy -- they believe the price of the underlying shares will increase -- and there's been virtually no insider buying activity to speak of in Chipotle.\n\nHowever, the biggest red flag is Chipotle Mexican Grill's valuation. A fast-casual restaurant chain shouldn't be trading at respective multiples of 62 times and 51 times forecast earnings for the current and upcoming year.\n\nAlthough optimists are quick to point to Chipotle's sustained double-digit sales growth, it's important to recognize that roughly half of this growth comes from opening new stores. During the first quarter, Chipotle's organic growth rate from its existing stores clocked in at 7%. While this is a fantastic organic growth rate for a chain as large as Chipotle, it's all the evidence we need that a forward-year earnings multiple of 51 isn't warranted.\n\nEven if Chipotle continues to outperform other fast-casual restaurant chains in the operating department, the company's stock-split euphoria isn't going to last. In other words, following Ackman's lead and paring down your stake in Chipotle may be the smart move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, many investors prefer to have entire shares of companies rather than fractional ownership. While this may sound absurd to people who don\u2019t mind using fractional trading, it\u2019s the reason why stock splits generate so much traction.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) both soared after announcing 10-for-1 stock splits. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) also rocketed to all-time highs after announcing a 50-for-1 stock split. People want to own entire shares of their favorite companies and have a large quantity of shares. Stock splits make that possible for corporations with high stock prices, but you can find plenty of companies with market prices below $50/share.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t buy a stock just because it\u2019s trading below $50/share, but these three stocks offer some upside to investors at a reasonable price per share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSemrush (SEMR) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks. stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is a search engine marketing tool that generates annual recurring revenue from more than 100,000 paying customers. The firm reported 21% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter along with a big surge in net income. GAAP profits totaled $2.14 million compared to a $9.86 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year.\n\nRising profits and annual recurring revenue point to more gains for the $2 billion company. Accelerated net income growth should also make Semrush\u2019s P/E ratio more reasonable within a year. While the stock is only up by 2% year-to-date, its 50% gain over the past year demonstrates what is possible.\n\nMany businesses will continue to use Semrush to appear on top of search results and create effective ad campaigns.

However, the dip presents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors. That\u2019s what SoFi\u2019s CEO Anthony Noto thinks. He purchased another $199,000 worth of stock and now has 8.12 million SoFi shares. There are a few reasons why investors may want to consider following the CEO\u2019s lead.\n\nRevenue for the fintech firm increased by 37% year-over-year in\u00a0Q1 2024. That\u2019s not surprising for investors who are in the know. SoFi has regularly delivered high revenue growth for its investors. However, net income growth presents a more compelling opportunity. The firm reported $88.0 million in GAAP net income compared to a GAAP net loss of $34.4 million in the same period last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi still makes a lot of its money from loans, but the company is diversifying away from those products.

Revenue growth is picking up, and two key segments have the potential to further accelerate growth rates.\n\nThe remote work marketplace reported 19% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0first quarter of 2024. Upwork also shared that it\u2019s experiencing soaring demand for its advertising and Freelancer Plus segments.

WFC and Palomar Holdings PLMR.\n\n4 Top Stocks Worth a Buy for Superrb Earnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is the highest priority for any organization. This is because if a start-up or well-known company doesn't make money, it won't last long.\n\nSo, what is earnings growth? Study a company's revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing share price. But, expectations of earnings play a significant role.\n\nEarnings Estimates & Share Price Movements\n\nFrequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company's earnings failing to meet market expectations.\n\nEarnings estimates embody analysts' opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.\n\nThus, investors should look for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.\n\nHere are the best four stocks that stand out:\n\nSkechers designs, develops, markets and distributes footwear for men, women and children. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). SKX's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 16.9%.

        "title": "Why The 22% Return On Capital At Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) Should Have Your Attention",
        "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE:CMG) look very promising so lets take a look.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Chipotle Mexican Grill:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.22 = US$1.7b \u00f7 (US$8.4b - US$997m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nTherefore, Chipotle Mexican Grill has an ROCE of 22%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Chipotle Mexican Grill compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Chipotle Mexican Grill  for free.\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Chipotle Mexican Grill Tell Us?\n\nThe trends we've noticed at Chipotle Mexican Grill are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 22%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 83%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Chipotle Mexican Grill thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that Chipotle Mexican Grill is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\n\nOne more thing, we've spotted  1 warning sign  facing Chipotle Mexican Grill that you might find interesting.\n\nHigh returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nStory continues\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Millionaire Minting Marvels: 7 Growth Stocks to Buy for 10X Gains",
        "content": "Most millionaires reach that level of wealth by investing their cash into profitable assets. Investments allow your money to work for you, and the growth becomes more pronounced once you get past the first $100,000.\n\nThat milestone is the hardest part about being a millionaire. That\u2019s because of how percentages work. If your $10,000 portfolio goes up by 10%, you only have $11,000. That\u2019s still better than nothing, but if you generate that same return on a $500,000 portfolio, your portfolio will gain an additional $50,000.\n\nBoth scenarios demonstrate what happens with a 10% return, but one portfolio generated an additional $50,000 while the smaller portfolio only brought in $1,000. Buying growth stocks with exceptional returns can help you reach your financial goals sooner. Combine that with regular investments, and it\u2019s possible to reach a 7-figure portfolio. Investors with that objective may want to look closely at these seven growth stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been a top cybersecurity player for several years, but its recent inclusion in the S&P 500 has brought more attention to the outperformer. The stock is up by 58% year-to-date and has gained 440% over the past five years.\n\nCrowdstrike continues to report robust revenue growth, while other cybersecurity companies are experiencing growth deceleration due to industrial headwinds. This context makes Crowdstrike\u2019s 33% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 FY25 even more impressive. Net income also expanded in the quarter, going from $0.5 million to $42.8 million year-over-year.\n\nThe company\u2019s business model indicates that more gains are likely. Most of Crowdstrike\u2019s revenue is recurring, and it closed out the quarter with $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue. That includes $211.7 million in net new recurring yearly revenue added in the quarter. Cybersecurity is a booming industry that becomes more important every year, and Crowdstrike is leading the pack.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckersOutdoor (NYSE:DECK) has gained market share in the athletic apparel industry. At the same time, corporate heavyweights like Nike (NYSE:NKE) are losing ground. Deckers Outdoor continues to march forward with its UGG and HOKA brands.\n\nIt\u2019s another recent addition to the S&P 500 that has been crushing the stock market. Shares are up by 51% year-to-date and have gained 480% over the past five years. Deckers Outdoor is valued at $26 billion and trades at a 35 P/E ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe athletic apparel company reported solid results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue increased by 21.2% year-over-year in the quarter and was up by 18% for the year. The HOKA brand made up more than half of total sales and was up by 34.0% year-over-year. UGG sales were up by 14.9% year-over-year, reaching $361.3 million.\n\nDeckers Outdoor is growing in both the domestic and international markets. Domestic sales increased by 19.4% year over year, while international sales were up by 25.2% year over year. Strong growth in both markets points to more runway for the stock.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) helps millions of people learn new languages. The educational tech company has also recently expanded to offer lessons in various subjects, like math and music. More than 31.4 million people use Duolingo every day. Duolingo cited the 54% year-over-year increase to a record number of net daily user additions. The surge in daily active users contributed to the company\u2019s 45% year-over-year revenue growth. Duolingo reported $167.6 million in total revenue compared to $27.0 million in net income.\n\nDuolingo now exhibits double-digit profit margins after burning through cash just a year ago. The net profit margin came in at 16.1% this quarter. Shares are up by more than 40% over the past year, including a 19% gain over the past month. Duolingo looks ready to rally, and rising profits will make the valuation more reasonable for long-term investors. The company is currently valued at $9 billion.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Explore the stock market trends for 2024 with analytical visuals of businessman planning long term investments and future business growth, Navigate towards success with smart strategies. growth stocks with millionaire potential\n\nSource: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is the search engine marketing tool of choice for many freelancers and businesses. The platform makes it easier to discover good keywords, run successful ad campaigns, and monitor the competition.\n\nMany businesses compete for the top search results on Google, Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) child company. Some small businesses make millions of dollars each year by ranking at the top of Google\u2019s search results for the right keywords. Companies will look for any competitive edge to increase their chances of showing up on Google, and Semrush has helped many businesses.\n\nThe digital marketing tool has 112,000 paying customers, up by 10% year-over-year. Semrush is also doing a great job getting customers to upgrade their subscriptions. Even though the paying customer base only increased by 10% year-over-year, revenue was up by 21% year-over-year. Semrush also generated a profit of $2.1 million during the quarter. Semrush also has 1.13 million registered free active customers. This figure is up by 27% year-over-year and presents additional revenue growth opportunities. Most of Semrush\u2019s revenue is recurring, translating into steady growth.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.\n\nSource: Funstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) hasn\u2019t had the best stretch. It\u2019s down by 28% year-to-date and over 80% from its peak. However, the tide appears to be shifting for Upwork. The company is only valued at $1.4 billion and trades at a 30 P/E ratio. That P/E ratio is reasonable for a leader in the remote work industry with rising revenue and earnings.\n\nThe remote work marketplace reported 19% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter 2024. While revenue reached $190.9 million, net income reached $18.4 million, a 7% year-over-year improvement. Upwork presents growth at a reasonable price, and if growth surges, the current price can look like a bargain.\n\nWhile remote work continues to attract more attention, Upwork\u2019s advertising segment also presents a compelling opportunity. Upwork\u2019s ads and monetization products segment grew by 93% year over year and is the company\u2019s fastest-growing revenue stream. Freelancer Plus exceeded 100,000 active subscriptions and was up by 76% year over year. Continued growth in these revenue streams can help Upwork regain positive momentum and deliver solid gains.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) continues to march higher. It\u2019s up by 50% year-to-date as a 50-for-1 stock split looms for the fast food restaurant chain. Chipotle\u2019s healthier food options have given it more pricing power. Despite multiple price hikes, customers come through Chipotle\u2019s doors in droves and continue to elevate the company\u2019s financials.\n\nChipotle reported 14.1% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, fueled by a 7.0% year-over-year increase in comparable restaurant sales growth. Net income remained elevated by 23.2% year-over-year, resulting in a 13.3% net profit margin.\n\nWhile the stock gains have been impressive for several years, more growth is on the menu. Chipotle opened up 47 new restaurants in the quarter and remains on pace for 285-315 new restaurants this year. New restaurant openings allow Chipotle to deliver higher revenue growth since it can reach customers in more locations. Reducing how far people drive to arrive at a Chipotle can also increase how often its most loyal customers buy food from one of its restaurants.\n\nSoFi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) has been a tough hold for long-term investors. Shares are down by more than 30% year-to-date and 38% over the past five years. Additionally, the stock is more than 70% removed from its all-time high.\n\nDespite this context, SoFi looks like it\u2019s on the verge of outperforming the stock market. The digital bank reported 37% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2024 and net income of $88.0 million. SoFi\u2019s profits are notable since the fintech firm reported a net loss of $34.4 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nSoFi\u2019s financial products are picking up momentum. It offers bank accounts, loans, credit cards, investment portfolios, and other resources for its 8.1 million members. SoFi CEO Anthony Noto has been capitalizing on the lower price of SoFi stock. He recently purchased $199,000 worth of SoFi stock and now has 8.12 million shares in the company. It\u2019s usually a good sign when the CEO is buying more shares of his own company.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, DECK, and SOFI.

        "content": "The S&P 500 is a market index of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. stock market exchange. The S&P 500 has around 80% of the entire market capitalization of public companies in the country, and it is generally known as the more reliable investment.\n\nHowever, investors should still be cautious about buying S&P 500 stocks and should complete due diligence beforehand. Specifically, during this time of high interest rates, consumer discretionary companies often struggle to bring high returns if this macroeconomic headwind continues.\n\nDespite their stability, they will most likely experience slowing growth shortly due to macroeconomic conditions and a declining reputation resulting from too aggressive cost-cutting efforts. Many of these companies are implementing corporate-wide layoffs and facing a fall in revenue, indicating no sign of growth in the near future. Below are three S&P 500 stocks investors should sell before they crash.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nS&P 500 Stocks to Sell: Home Depot Inc (HD) the outside of a home depot store\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) is the largest U.S. home improvement retailer, selling items ranging from furniture to decorations. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, the company has been an American home supplies powerhouse for the past few years.\n\nWhile Home Depot has long established itself as the country\u2019s most popular home improvement retailer, the company is currently suffering from macroeconomic conditions. Struggling with the high mortgage rates and inflation, Home Depot reported a decline in sales for the past three consecutive quarters. By the nature of discretionary projects, customers are less likely to invest in home improvements such as furniture or bedroom remodeling in times of\u00a0high inflation or a downturn.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Home Depot reported a 2.3% decrease in sales year over year. For the past year, the company has experienced consecutive revenue losses, and there are no signs of recovering from this downfall.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) has long been America\u2019s favorite clothing brand. Established as the largest athletic footwear and apparel company in the world for decades, Nike still remains consumers\u2019 top place to shop for athletic wear. Despite its strong brand recognition and image, the corporation has not performed well financially recently.\n\nIn the past months, the sneaker giant has announced its plan to cut around 2% of its total workers as part of its cost-cutting initiative. As of now, Nike is expecting a decline in sales and revenue in the first half of next year, which is a major reason behind Nike\u2019s efforts to reduce its production costs. The company\u2019s stock has been suffering heavily since the beginning of the year, dipping more than 12% year to date and down 23% year to year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, earlier this month, Nike\u2019s CFO Matthew Friend sold 9,350 shares of the company, indicating a gloomy future for Nike.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is an American-style Mexican fast-food restaurant that has grown extremely popular in the past decade due to its taste and casual dining experience at an affordable price. Given its convenience and quality, considering its price, it was especially popular among younger people who prefer the accessibility of fast food at such an affordable price. Chipotle has pioneered and established the fast food bowl culture, which led to its immense success and growth.\n\nHowever, this is the exact reason why investors should sell Chipotle. The biggest problem Chipotle is currently facing is its declining reputation, and customers are losing faith in the company. In a restaurant industry where customer loyalty plays a major role, Chipotle is losing a lot of its popularity due to shrinking portion sizes. For a company that thrives off of quality food at a reasonable price and good portion, this fundamental mistake directly translates to a loss in popularity and revenue. While this might seem like an easy fix, the executives have not been able to regain the faith of the customers, which I think will lead to a decline in the company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andy Kim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) The Best Restaurant Stock to Buy in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list Analyst Recommends 10 Best Stocks to Diversify Your Portfolio Away from Mega-Cap Tech and AI Stocks. Since Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nVenu Krishna, Head of U.S. Equity Strategy & Global Equity Linked Strategies at Barclays, recently shared a basket of stocks he recommends offsetting the risks that come from market concentration in big tech stocks. In an interview with CNBC, Krishna emphasized that he remains inclined towards big tech stocks, but the important question he addressed is which stocks offer more value outside of the tech sector in the long term.\n\nKrishna\u2019s methodology to find some of the best stocks outside of the tech sector is simple: find out at what \u201ccore fundamental\u201d metrics big tech stocks are \u201cexcelling\u201d at and then \u201ctry to come close to that and create a portfolio which can give us that kind of exposure.\u201d Through this methodology, Krishna says, he came up with a well-diversified portfolio of stocks that could act as a \u201chedge\u201d against market concertation in big tech.\n\nKrishna said he applied \u201cliquidity filters\u201d on the whole market to remove a \u201cbunch of companies\u201d and narrow down to stocks with strong growth and FCF multiples.\n\nDespite him pointing out the concentration of gains problem, Venu Krishna believes the rise of big tech stocks is a \u201chealthy trend\u201d and some of the gains are now bifurcating to other sectors, too.\n\nHowever Krishna said that over the past 18 months his portfolio of stocks has lagged behind the Big Tech, but outperformed equal-weighted S&P 500 and market cap-weighted S&P 500.\n\nFor this article, we took a look at Krishna\u2019s latest basket of stocks to offset concentration in big tech risks and picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nSusan Law Cain / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 60\n\nChipotle is one of the stocks Barclays analyst Venu Krishna believes could offset the tech concentration risks.\n\nIn April, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) posted strong Q1 results, which showed revenue in the period jumped by 13.9% on a YoY basis, beating estimates by $30 million. Comparable sales in the quarter increased by 7%. For the full year, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) expects its comp sales to grow in the mid to high-single digit range. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) has been steadily increasing its footprint over the past several years. Back in 2007, the company had just 704 stores. This figure now stands at 3437. One of the biggest signs of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u2019s (NYSE:CMG) strengths is its rising margins, even when the restaurant industry is reeling from high labor costs and squeezing margins. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u2019s (NYSE:CMG) current net margin of 12.45% is the highest it has been in the past decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CMG)\u00a0trades at 47X 2025 EPS estimate of $66.92 set by Wall Street analysts. This P/E is much higher than the industry of 16. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CMG)\u00a0is expected to see revenue growth of just 13-15% per year over the next 3 years, while its EPS growth is expected to come in between 3% to 20%. Analysts expect the American consumer to remain prudent in spending amid higher for longer interest rate scenario and dwindling savings. Therefore, for investors looking for high-growth stock appreciation names, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CMG)\u00a0might not be the ideal choice.\n\nAverage analyst estimate for Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) is $3244.77, which presents just 3% upside potential from the current levels. That means the Wall Street believes the stock has reached its potential and based on current catalysts and growth trajectory it does not have any room to grow significantly.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe best investment ideas are simple. We have previously written about\u00a0Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG). It turned out that this was our best investment idea since starting the fund. The stock is up 10x since we first invested at the end of 2017 (~47% annualized). Sounds absolutely incredible, except that your managers sold CMG back in 2018 (thinking that the stock had gotten ahead of itself), and proudly booked an 85% profit in 6 months, patting ourselves in the back. Interestingly, when we wrote about this in our 2019 letter, describing our big mistake to sell, the stock still went up +270% since that letter, delivering an impressive 30% annual return. This is an incredibly important point! You do not get many Chipotles in your investing career. Companies like these are super rare and the opportunity to buy them at an attractive price (which we got in 2017) is even rarer. Booking a quick profit, paying the capital gains tax and thinking that you will find another CMG to invest your proceeds into is usually delusional.\n\nAlong with our personal investment case of CMG, let us compare that to the experience that Bill Ackman had with the same investment. He is a famous hedge fund manager that we greatly admire, who has achieved an incredible track record in the past 20 years running Pershing Square. Bill Ackman has owned the restaurant stock since the third quarter of 2016 at an initial cost basis of about $411 per share (our cost basis was $289). Originally, Mr. Ackman bought 2.88 million shares. He was wise to hold on to CMG stock and it still is the top position in his fund (18% weight). But, if you follow his 13F filings, which are the public filings disclosing large investment manager\u2019s holdings of publicly traded securities, he kept trimming his position as the stock went up. We calculated that if he just sat on his original 2.88 million shares and didn\u2019t sell a share, his position would be worth $8.8 billion today. This would represent ~50% of his entire firms\u2019 assets under management (AUM). But he only has $1.8 billion invested in CMG as of Q1 2024. As Charlie Munger said: \u201c\u201cThe first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.\u201d\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Analyst Recommends 10 Best Stocks to Diversify Your Portfolio Away from Mega-Cap Tech and AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Chipotle (CMG) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this Mexican food chain is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Chipotle is 41.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 23.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 8.4%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Chipotle is 29.5%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 10.7%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 28% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Chipotle. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Chipotle a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Chipotle well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 7 Blue-Chip Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "It is a great time to look for blue-chip stocks to buy. Buying and holding reliable companies can result in steady returns without stress. You don\u2019t have to actively monitor price fluctuations or swing trade to generate massive profits in the stock market. Time in the market instead of timing the market can work wonders, but you have to pick the right stocks.\n\nSome blue-chip stocks offer a good mix of stability and growth. It\u2019s possible to outperform the stock market by comparing blue-chip stocks and strategically constructing your portfolio, but what should you look for? While each investor has different philosophies, it\u2019s good to look for companies that can deliver rising revenue and profit margins. Corporations with vast competitive moats are also less likely to lose market share or get replaced entirely.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to find moonshot stocks to accumulate solid gains. Here are the blue-chip stocks to buy that can continue to gain momentum and reward patient investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (META) A character inside a virtual world. Metaverse.\n\nSource: Led Gapline / Shutterstock\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has become a compelling leader in the advertising industry after a commitment to efficiency. Net income more than doubled year-over-year in Q1 2024 while revenue jumped by 27% year-over-year. Investors have accumulated positions in the social media giant due to the solid financials. Shares are up by 46% year-to-date and have gained 164% over the past five years. Thus, I think it is one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nThe company\u2019s continued user base growth should spark additional revenue growth. Daily active users across Meta Platforms\u2019 social networks reached 3.24 billion, up 7% year-over-year. A few months ago, the company generated many headlines for offering its first dividend. Meta Platforms distributed $1.27 billion to investors via dividends and repurchased $14.64 billion of shares.\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 growth comes amid significant cost-cutting measures. The company\u2019s headcount is down by 10% year-over-year, and more cuts can come. Meta Platforms recently announced that it will trim the number of VP positions.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Stock Is a Winner With Big Upside Potential\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been on a tear. Shares are up by 60% year-to-date and have soared by 533% over the past five years. The chipmaker has been a semiconductor leader for many years, and recent AI chips have accelerated revenue.\n\nBroadcom reported $12.5 billion in Q2 2024 revenue, a 43% improvement from the same quarter last year. Revenue from AI products reached a record $3.1 billion in the quarter, while Infrastructure revenue also accelerated due to VMware. Revenue was up by 12% year-over-year, excluding VMware.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chipmaker recently attracted more investors with its 10-for-1 stock split. Broadcom is following in Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) footsteps with the split that has generated more interest for the stock. Broadcom currently has a market cap above $800 billion, and it\u2019s realistic for the company to surpass the $1 trillion milestone this year or the next. While investors wait for that milestone, they enjoy a 1.21% yield and an impressive dividend growth rate.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has branched out into many industries and might as well be a fund at this point. The company is leading high-growth verticals like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, business software, social media, advertising, gaming, and others.\n\nIt has a chorus of supporters on Wall Street. Analysts have rated the stock as a Strong Buy with an average price target that suggests a 13% upside. The highest price target of $600 per share implies that shares can march 35% higher from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft has been delivering solid quarters for years, and Q3 FY24 was no different. Revenue increased by 17% year-over-year, while net income increased by 20% year-over-year. Microsoft Copilot allows the firm to strengthen its product line across multiple industries, which should lead to additional revenue. Copilot for Security is an example of this trend, and it positions Microsoft to gain more market share in the cybersecurity industry.\n\nVisa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot every blue-chip stock is a flashy tech company. Many of these stocks are hidden in plain sight. Whenever you use a credit or debit card to buy goods or services, the company creating those cards receives a small percentage of the transaction.\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a leading credit and debit card issuer that regularly generates net profit margins above 50%. The fintech stock is up 5% year-to-date and has gained 56% over the past five years. It trades at a 33 P/E ratio and offers a 0.77% yield. While the yield is low, Visa has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for over a decade.\n\nWall Street analysts liked the stock and gave it a consensus Strong Buy rating. The average price target implies a 17% gain from current levels. As consumers remained resilient, Visa delivered 10% year-over-year revenue and net income growth in Q2 FY24. These growth rates give Visa plenty of capital for stock buybacks and dividend distributions.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Chipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeople need to eat, but not everyone has the time or patience to make meals from home. Fast-food restaurants have capitalized on this trend, but the industry is shifting. More consumers are becoming health-conscious, which has put some of the most established fast-food restaurant chains at risk of declining growth.\n\nLuckily, those problems don\u2019t affect Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), a top restaurant chain known for healthier food options than most competitors. Chipotle has repeatedly raised prices while retaining customers and delivering higher profit margins.\n\nThe Mexican Grill chain reported 14.1% year-over-year growth, with net sales at $2.7 billion. Some of that growth is due to Chipotle\u2019s new restaurant openings, but comparable restaurant sales were up by 7.0% year-over-year. Chipotle remains on target to open 285-315 new restaurants in 2024, increasing the likelihood of double-digit revenue growth rates. Net income was up by 23.2% year-over-year. As such, I think it is one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nCommVault Systems (CVLT) Techy looking chip on circuit board with \"blue chip stocks\" engraved in blue light on semiconductor chip\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Mahambah\n\nCommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) is a cloud security firm with a 31 P/E ratio and a $5 billion market cap. The Russell 2000 member is relatively hidden compared to other cybersecurity companies, but it has the potential to outperform many of them.\n\nCommVault Systems has outperformed the stock market in recent years. Shares are up by 51% year-to-date and have gained 139% over the past five years. CommVault Systems should continue to generate additional gains as its annual recurring revenue (ARR) picks up. The firm currently has $770 million in total ARR, up by 16% year-over-year. Subscription ARR reached $597 million and is up by 25% year-over-year. Success with annual recurring revenue should translate into accelerating growth rates for revenue and net income.\n\nInvestors saw both of those outcomes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Full-year revenue increased by 7% year-over-year while Q4 FY24 revenue was up by 10% year-over-year. Net income came to $23.1 million if we exclude an income tax windfall. If we exclude tax benefits, that\u2019s compared to $83.6 million in full-year revenue. 27.6% of the company\u2019s total profits came in the last quarter. It represents accelerated growth which can translate into meaningful long-term gains.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) provides business safety equipment and supplies for more than one million North American businesses. The company regularly reports double-digit net profit margins and has been crushing the stock market. Shares are up by 18% year-to-date and have roughly tripled over the past five years.\n\nCintas currently trades at a 48 P/E ratio and offers a 0.79% yield. The firm has maintained a double-digit annualized dividend growth rate for several years and has regularly returned capital to its investors. Cintas\u2019 Q3 FY24 earnings results suggest it should have no issue providing shareholders with additional capital and long-term growth. Revenue increased by 9.9% year-over-year to reach $2.41 billion. Net income totaled $397.6 million, a 22.0% improvement compared to last year\u2019s quarter.\n\nWall Street analysts have mostly rated Cintas as a Moderate Buy, with a projected 4% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $790 per share indicates that Cintas can gain an additional 13.5%.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AVGO, MSFT, and CVLT.

        "title": "Marketing Efforts to Aid Chipotle (CMG) Amid Cost Challenges",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG will likely benefit from innovative marketing, technological advancement and strategic expansion. Also, the emphasis on throughput improvement bodes well. However, operational challenges and inflationary pressures are a concern.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s delve deeper.\n\nKey Catalysts\n\nChipotle's marketing efforts have been pivotal in driving sales and customer engagement. Campaigns like the \u2018Behind the Foil\u2019 series, which highlights the real teams preparing fresh food daily, have reinforced the brand's commitment to quality. The promotion of Braised Beef Barbacoa and the limited-time return of Chicken Al Pastor has successfully attracted more customers and increased transaction volumes. The campaigns not only spotlight existing menu items but also capitalize on consumer insights to enhance product appeal.\n\nChipotle's investment in its digital platform has paid off handsomely. During the first quarter, digital sales represented 37% of total sales, providing a boost to overall revenues. The company's robust rewards program, with a digital reach of 40 million members, has been a key driver in this area. Chipotle continues to explore innovative technologies, such as the automated digital make line and Autocado, to improve efficiency and customer experience further.\n\nChipotle focuses on improving throughput in its restaurants to drive growth. By streamlining operations and enhancing service speed, CMG managed to serve more customers efficiently. This is evident from their recent performance, where they achieved the highest throughput levels in four years. The strategic implementation of the \u2018four pillars\u2019 of throughput, which include key operational roles and readiness for peak times, is adding to the positives.\n\nChipotle's growth strategy includes aggressive expansion, both in North America and internationally. The company opened 47 new restaurants in the first quarter, including 43 with Chipotlanes, its drive-thru format designed to enhance convenience. The successful entry into new markets, such as the opening of its first restaurant in Kuwait, marks a significant step in Chipotle's international growth plans.\n\nFinancially, Chipotle has shown impressive performance at the restaurant level. During the first quarter, the restaurant-level margin came in at 27.5%, up by 190 basis points year over year. This improvement reflects the company's effective cost management and operational efficiencies. The ability to maintain strong margins while expanding rapidly is a testament to Chipotle's sound financial strategy and execution.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nChipotle\u2019s shares have surged 47.2% year to date against the industry\u2019s 3.8% decline.\n\nConcerns\n\nChipotle faces several operational challenges as it navigates transitions in its menu and promotional offerings. The conclusion of the Chicken Al Pastor promotion, along with the need to lap last year\u2019s menu price increase and the highly successful Carne Asada campaign, poses significant hurdles. These transitions require strategic planning to maintain customer interest and ensure smooth operational execution.\n\nChipotle is also contending with inflation across several ingredient costs, particularly beef, produce, and avocados. Although the previous year\u2019s menu price increase provided some relief, the company still faces a protein mix headwind from the successful Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative. For the second quarter, Chipotle expects its cost of sales to rise to the mid-29% range, reflecting higher prices across several items, notably avocados. The company anticipates the cost of sales inflation to remain in the mid-single-digit range for the rest of the year.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nChipotle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are:\r\n\r\nWingstop Inc. WING sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 21.4%, on average. The stock has surged 121.9% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for WING\u2019s 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) suggests a rise of 27.5% and 36.7%, respectively, from year-ago levels.\n\nBrinker International, Inc. EAT sports a Zacks Rank #1. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 213.4%, on average. EAT\u2019s shares have risen 88.3% in the past year.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EAT\u2019s 2024 sales and EPS indicates 5.1% and 41.3% growth, respectively, from the year-earlier actuals.\n\nEl Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. LOCO currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 19.4%, on average. LOCO\u2019s shares have risen 5.7% in the past year.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for LOCO\u2019s 2025 sales and EPS indicates 3.8% and 9.9% growth, respectively, from the prior-year figures.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Has Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Outpaced Other Retail-Wholesale Stocks This Year?",
        "content": "For those looking to find strong Retail-Wholesale stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Is Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) one of those stocks right now? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Retail-Wholesale peers, we might be able to answer that question.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is one of 213 individual stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #12 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups. The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. Chipotle Mexican Grill is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMG's full-year earnings has moved 4.2% higher within the past quarter. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.\n\nAccording to our latest data, CMG has moved about 47.2% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, the Retail-Wholesale sector has returned an average of 12.1% on a year-to-date basis. This means that Chipotle Mexican Grill is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.\n\nOne other Retail-Wholesale stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year is Itochu Corp. (ITOCY). The stock is up 16% year-to-date.\n\nThe consensus estimate for Itochu Corp.'s current year EPS has increased 4.2% over the past three months.

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Chipotle (CMG): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).\n\nChipotle currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.68, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 31 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.68 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 31 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.5% and 3.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CMG Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CMG\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Chipotle here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Chipotle, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs CMG a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Chipotle, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $55.31.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Chipotle. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Chipotle may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $3384.04 in the previous session. Chipotle Mexican Grill has gained 47.2% since the start of the year compared to the 12.1% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the -1.4% return for the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 24, 2024, Chipotle reported EPS of $13.37 versus consensus estimate of $11.63 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.01%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Chipotle is expected to post earnings of $55.31 per share on $11.35 billion in revenues. This represents a 23.29% change in EPS on a 14.97% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $66.52 per share on $12.84 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 20.26% and 13.11%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nChipotle may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nChipotle has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 60.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 19.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 59.1X versus its peer group's average of 9.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.68. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Chipotle currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Chipotle fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Chipotle shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.\n\nHow Does CMG Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of CMG have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Brinker International, Inc. (EAT). EAT has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Brinker International, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 7.83%, and for the current fiscal year, EAT is expected to post earnings of $4.47 per share on revenue of $4.35 billion.\n\nShares of Brinker International, Inc. have gained 6.2% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 17.11X and a P/CF of 10.33X.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry may rank in the bottom 63% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CMG and EAT, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Restaurant Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "Apart from the great Chipotle Mexican Grill (NASDAQ:CMG), one of the most remarkable and resilient high-growth restaurant stocks on the market in recent years, the fast food, fast casual, and quick-serve restaurant scene hasn\u2019t been too hot lately.\n\nNot all chains have been able to keep thriving amid inflation, especially those known for offering some of the most competitive prices in the industry. Despite the higher costs of living, people still seem willing to pay more if they\u2019re getting food that\u2019s perceived as made with higher-quality, potentially healthier ingredients.\n\nAt this inflation winddown phase, I think quality could become more important than affordability. Of course, price sensitivity also remains vital, given intense industry competition and consumer cravings for a good deal.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this piece, we\u2019ll examine three restaurant stocks rated as buys by many analysts that may be worth considering in late June.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill has continued to set the new growth standard for the restaurant industry. With the stock soaring close to 60% in the past year and over 158% in the last two years, many are likely wondering just how much this nearly parabolic recent rally has to go.\n\nThough getting on the expensive side, I still view Chipotle as having the legs to climb past $3,500 per share. Many analysts feel the same way as the high-growth restaurant chain approaches its much-awaited and much-needed stock split.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs view Chipotle as a \u201cleader in offering value and quality to customers,\u201d which is quite remarkable given \u201cconsumer behavior changes\u201d hitting the industry. I couldn\u2019t agree more. Undoubtedly, Chipotle has a not-so-secret formula for growth, and until now, few other firms have been able to follow the same playbook.\n\nShould rivals catch up with consumer trends by offering higher-quality food for an incrementally higher price, perhaps CMG stock\u2019s momentum could slow. Until then, I find little reason to throw in the towel.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there\u2019s a firm that seems to be taking a page out of Chipotle\u2019s playbook, it\u2019s Cava (NYSE:CAVA), a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant that\u2019s growing quite rapidly. With a $10.25 billion market cap, there\u2019s plenty of room to run as the firm continues its expansion.\n\nIn many ways, Cava sounds like the little brother of a Chipotle. With delicious, healthy, and customizable Mediterranean meals, Cava is quickly becoming a household name for many. With more growth runway and no shortage of new menu items, Cava stands out as a restaurant high-flyer, which, like Chipotle, deserves a rich premium to the industry averages.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, at writing, the stock trades at more than 420 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), making it one of the most expensive restaurant stocks you\u2019ll likely come across this year.\n\nAt around eight times price-to-sales (P/S), CAVA stock looks somewhat more palatable, especially once the company shifts gears from sales growth to margin enhancement. That said, for now, Cava has its foot on the gas. It\u2019s a high double-digit grower fit for fans of the chain who aren\u2019t put off by volatility and the pie-in-the-sky multiple.\n\nShake Shack (SHAK) The Shake Shack (SHAK) on 125th Street in Harlem, New York City, USA\n\nSource: Here Now / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), an upscale burger and frozen custard chain that\u2019s trying to show the world that consumers are more than willing to pay a little more to get a lot more quality. Though the value proposition is up for debate, I do find the company\u2019s expansion plan could help SHAK stock resume its rally after recently plunging more than 18% off its 52-week highs near $110 per share.\n\nThe first Shake Shack opened in Canada last week in the city of Toronto, and it won\u2019t be the last one. With many Torontonians eager to try the American chain for the very first time, it will be interesting to gauge just how lucrative a market Canada can be as Shake Shack looks to gradually increase its footprint north of the border.\n\nFor now, the firm\u2019s taking it somewhat slow with the expansion into the new market, with just 34 additional stores to open in the next decade, less than the new locations to open in the U.S. in 2024. For now, I view the slow and steady expansion as incredibly prudent.

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CMG for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Chipotle Mexican Grill's main business drivers.\n\nA Delaware corporation, Chipotle Mexican Grill, together with its subsidiaries, operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains. The company was founded in 1993 by Steve Ells, who started with a single restaurant in Denver, CO. The company offers a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. Chipotle restaurants feature free-range, hormone-free pork, natural chicken and other meat products cooked using traditional methods and served in a unique atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe company is committed to using high-quality real ingredients, classic cooking techniques and distinctive interior design to serve customers. As of Dec 31, 2023, the company owned and operated more than 3,400 restaurants across the United States, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth is significantly driven by its digital platform. It has enhanced its capabilities by digitizing restaurant kitchens, expanding partnerships with third-party delivery services, and increasing the number of Chipotlanes (drive-through format for customer pick-up of digital orders). Digital sales, encompassing revenue generated through the Chipotle website, Chipotle app, or third-party delivery aggregators, which also includes revenue deferrals linked to Chipotle Rewards, constituted 37.4% of food and beverage revenue in 2023, compared to 39.4% in 2022 and 45.0% in 2021. The company has facilitated convenient digital ordering through enhancements to the Chipotle app and website, including unlimited customization, contactless delivery, and group ordering.\r\n\r\nThe company utilizes multiple marketing channels, including national television, digital marketing, social media, fundraising, events and sponsorships to reach consumers. Third-party service providers mostly provide delivery services.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Chipotle launched a loyalty program called Chipotle Rewards, which provides customers with the opportunity to earn bonus points or free food. Earned rewards generally expire one to six months after they are issued and points typically expire if an account is inactive for six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Chipotle Mexican Grill, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in June 2014 would be worth $5,670.34, or a 467.03% gain, as of June 18, 2024, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 181.84% and gold's return of 75.51% over the same time frame.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for CMG too.\n\nShares of Chipotle have outperformed the industry in the year-to-date period. The company is benefiting from its digital efforts, Chipotlane add-ons and marketing initiatives. This along with strength in digital sales and new restaurant openings have been driving the company. Also, a strong comparable restaurant sales growth bodes well. For 2024, Chipotle anticipates comps growth in the mid to high-single-digit range, driven by its transaction growth and strong comps growth trends. It intends to focus on the stage-gate process and leverage digital programs to expand access and convenience. Earnings estimates for 2024 have increased in the past 30 days, depicting analysts\u2019 optimism regarding the stock\u2019s growth potential. However, commodity and wage inflation are concerning.\n\nThe stock has jumped 5.95% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 14 higher, for fiscal 2024; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "4 Top Stocks Worth a Buy for Superb Earnings Growth",
        "content": "Earnings growth is the highest priority for any organization. This is because if a start-up or well-known company doesn\u2019t make money, it won\u2019t last long.\n\nSo, what is earnings growth? Study a company\u2019s revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing share price. But, expectations of earnings play a significant role.\n\nEarnings Estimates & Share Price Movements\n\nFrequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company\u2019s earnings failing to meet market expectations.\n\nEarnings estimates embody analysts\u2019 opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.\n\nThus, investors should look for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.\n\nScreening Measures:\n\nTo shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)\n\n5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (stocks with a strong EPS growth history).\n\n% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (companies that saw year-over-year earnings growth of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal).\n\n% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).\n\n% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week).\n\n% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).\n\nThe above criteria narrowed the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only eight. Here are the best four stocks that stand out:\n\nSkechers SKX designs, develops, markets and distributes footwear for men, women and children. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). SKX\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 16.9%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill CMG operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican restaurant chains. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). CMG\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 23.3%.\n\nWells Fargo & Company WFC is one of the largest financial services companies in the United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. WFC\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 9.5%.\n\nPalomar Holdings PLMR is an insurance holding company. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1. PLMR\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26%.\n\nYou can sign up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "title": "3 Consumer Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "During the current quarter, consumer confidence has dropped to levels not seen since the fourth quarter of 2023. Among the factors making consumers more pessimistic were inflation, their reduced savings and perceived weakness in the labor market. Nonetheless, many Americans plan to spend more money on food going forward. Meanwhile, Gen Z members intend to shell out more for apparel, and beauty products. On the other hand, 27% of high-income members of Gen Z reported that they were looking to buy more expensive items, up from 23% three months earlier. Meanwhile, 17% of respondents stated that they intended to spend more on pet food and supplies, versus just 9% who were looking to shell out less for those products. With all that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at three of the best consumer stocks to buy now.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I noted in the introduction, many American consumers intend to spend more on beauty products and apparel, while consumers have generally become less confident in the economy.\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) sells a great deal of apparel and a significant amount of beauty products. Additionally, it is well-known for selling low-cost products. As a result, WMT stock should get a boost from both trends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart is likely already benefiting from these factors as the firm delivered excellent Q1 financial results. Specifically, its operating income jumped 9.6% YOY to $6.84 billion while its top line increased 6% YOY to $161.5 billion.\n\nOn June 10, JPMorgan upgraded WMT stock to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cneutral.\u201d The bank believes that the name has both offensive and defensive attributes while the retailer can beat analysts\u2019 average estimates going forward. JPMorgan placed an $81 price target on the shares, well above their current level of $67.\n\nFreshpet (FRPT) A view of several packages of FreshPet (FRPT) pet food, on display at a local grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I also noted in the introduction, 17% of American consumers polled plan to raise the amount they spend on pet food and supplies. That\u2019s very good news for Freshpet (NASDAQ:FRPT) which markets natural fresh meals and treats for dogs and cats.\n\nFreshpet stocks have enjoyed a recent rally, sparked by the company\u2019s strong Q1 results. During that quarter, its revenue soared 34% versus the same period a year earlier to $223.8 million while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, soared to $30.6 million from just $3 million in Q1 of 2023.\n\nThe company attributed the 30.6% YOY increase in its sales volume in Q1 to its strong business model and the success of its marketing efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nFreshpet\u2019s impressive financial results in the last two quarters in combination with Americans\u2019 willingness to spend more on pet food, bode very well for the outlook of FRPT stock and make it one of the best consumer stocks to buy now.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is already growing very rapidly and should benefit a great deal from many Americans\u2019 intention to spend more on food going forward.\n\nGoldman Sachs recently initiated coverage of CMG stock with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating. The bank identified the name as being among the top six restaurant stocks. Goldman expects restaurant chains to continue to benefit from strong spending trends going forward, but warned that their ability to increase prices has become more limited. As a result, these companies will become more reliant on attracting additional customers and opening more restaurants.\n\nIn Q1, Chipotle\u2019s top line jumped an impressive 14% YOY while its restaurant-level margin climbed 1.9% YOY to 29.5%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Best Stock Split Buy: Nvidia, Broadcom, or Chipotle?",
        "content": "Stock-split fever is making the rounds. Some investors have been infected by it in a major way. That shouldn't be surprising considering the big names that have announced stock splits this year.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) announced an eyebrow-raising 50-for-1 stock split in March. It's scheduled for after the market close on June 25, 2024. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) beat Chipotle to the punch. Although the tech giant announced its 10-for-1 stock split in May, it conducted the split after the market close on June 7. Most recently, Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) announced a 10-for-1 stock split last week. The semiconductor maker plans to split its shares after the market close on July 12.\n\nIf you've got stock-split fever, all three stocks could be on your radar screen. But which is the best pick to buy right now? Here's how Chipotle, Nvidia, and Broadcom stack up against each other.\n\nThe stock splits don't matter much\n\nFirst things first: The stock splits for Chipotle, Nvidia, and Broadcom don't matter much in choosing between these stocks.\n\nPerhaps the splits will spark a temporary bounce. However, it's difficult to know if a split or other factors cause a stock to rise.\n\nMore importantly, stock splits don't change anything about these three companies' underlying businesses or prospects. Over the long term, stock movements correlate with earnings. Splitting shares could attract some investors who were reluctant to buy at high share prices, but the move won't impact Chipotle's, Nvidia's, or Broadcom's earnings by one penny.\n\nAn easy elimination\n\nWith that out of the way, I think the most practical way to decide which of these three is the best stock-split buy right now is to use a process of elimination. And there is one easy elimination among the group, in my view.\n\nChipotle reported year-over-year revenue growth of 14.1% in the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 27.3%. Those are solid numbers. However, this growth appears to be fully baked into Chipotle's share price and then some.\n\nThe stock trades at nearly 61 times forward earnings. Chipotle's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 2.83. Although the Tex-Mex restaurant chain continues to deliver strong growth, it isn't anywhere close to the level needed to justify the stock's valuation. I'd scratch Chipotle off the list.\n\nTwo great AI stocks, one winner\n\nOn the other hand, Broadcom and Nvidia can't be eliminated so easily. Both companies are delivering impressive growth. Both stocks sport valuations that don't seem to be as frothy as Chipotle's.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom's revenue soared 43% year over year in its fiscal 2024 Q2, which ended on May 5, 2024. Its earnings jumped more than 20%. Much of this success can be attributed to increasing demand for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) products.\n\nSure, Broadcom doesn't qualify as a cheap stock. Its shares trade at a forward earnings multiple of 36.9 with a PEG ratio of 1.69. However, Broadcom's price doesn't seem overly excessive in my opinion because of the semiconductor maker's AI-related growth prospects.\n\nThen there's Nvidia. Its revenue rose by a jaw-dropping 262% year over year in Q1. Adjusted earnings skyrocketed 461%. Business is booming thanks to the tremendous demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) in training and deploying AI systems.\n\nLike Broadcom, Nvidia isn't cheap based on commonly used valuation metrics. Its forward earnings multiple is a lofty 50.8. Nvidia's PEG ratio is 1.51. However, the company stands at the center of the AI revolution. It's quite possible that Nvidia's current valuation could look attractive in retrospect five years from now.\n\nI think that Broadcom and Nvidia are two great AI stocks. But until there's a good reason to expect Nvidia's growth to slow, it's the best stock-split pick of these three.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that there are not many restaurant stocks to buy currently available. Consumers are reigning in their spending and reducing the amount they spend. It took a while for the U.S. Federal Reserve to catch up to the trends. However, interest rate increases and ongoing inflationary problems have finally started to bring an end to excess consumer discretionary spending.\n\nEven the world\u2019s largest restaurant chain, McDonalds (NYSE:MCD), is feeling the squeeze. Starting later this month, it plans on offering a $5 meal deal to bring back customers. But, as the promotion is only a month long, it remains to be seen if that will change the tide of its currently mixed financial results.\n\nThis all leaves investors wondering what the best restaurant stocks to buy right now are. There certainly are good buys out there, but it will depend greatly on how each restaurant company will navigate the near future while also planning for the long-term. Taking that into account, here are three of the best restaurant stocks to buy in June 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSweetgreen (SG) indoor vertical farming set up with green plants on shelves and PVC irrigation tubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/YEINISM\n\nSweetgreen (NYSE:SG) is a fast casual salad restaurant chain founded in the Washington, D.C. area in 2007. It went public in November 2021, right around the time the stock market as a whole took a major dip. So it\u2019s not surprising that in the first six months of being publicly traded it lost almost 83% of its value.\n\nBut the company is up a staggering 205% year-to-date (YTD), thanks in part to it beating all major expectations for its first quarter results. Sweetgreen opened six new restaurants during the first quarter. And, same-store sales increased 5%, 2% higher than management expected. Revenue totaled $158 million, which was better than management\u2019s expectation of $154 million at best.\n\nSweetgreen is growing in popularity and plans to open up to 28 new stores in 2024, including nine automated restaurants. The company has also been very strategic as it opens new locations. It prefers to place them in areas with a large population, in high employment areas and in high income areas. As a relatively new name in the restaurant industry, there is plenty of opportunity for growth. SG appears to be one of the great restaurant stocks to buy right now.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) seems to be weathering a recent controversy mostly unharmed. The CEO, Brian Niccol, has been lambasted online for his tone deaf response to customers\u2019 complaints about portion sizes. However, CMG stock is up 41% on the year, and has remained relatively flat in the days since his video blunder went viral.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the end of this month, Chipotle is set to complete a 50-for-1 stock split in order to make its shares more affordable. This split will be one of the largest ever for the New York Stock Exchange and presents great potential for investors who can buy in now. However, it also implies good future upside for investors who need to wait until it becomes more affordable. With this development, CMG might be at the top of the list of best restaurant stocks to buy this month.\n\nOther recent positive financial developments for the company in Q1 include total revenue increasing by 14.1% to $2.7 billion. Additionally, comparable restaurant sales increased\u00a0 7% and diluted earnings per share came in at $13.01, a 23.9% year-over-year increase.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nWashington D.C. area restaurant founders must be on to something, because Cava (NYSE:CAVA) is another one of the top restaurant stocks to buy right now. Relatively new to the stock market having only gone public in June of 2023, Cava is up 137% since its IPO and 121% YTD.\n\nWhat some would consider the Mediterranean version of Chipotle, Cava offers bowls, salads and pita wraps. It targets a similar demographic as Sweetgreen and Chipotle, so it\u2019s no surprise it is also doing well in the current economy. While traffic has slowed, the company still recently reported great Q1 results. EPS came in at 12 cents, a dramatic improvement from a loss of $1.30 per share the year prior, and beating analysts\u2019 estimates of 5 cents. Revenue was up 30.3% to $256.3 million and beat Wall Street forecasts of $246 million.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Cava now expects to open 50 to 54 net new restaurants in 2024, up from its February outlook of 48 to 52 net openings. With that increase has come the expectation that same-restaurant sales and adjusted EBITDA will also be higher than previously estimated. As consumers look for more affordable options, restaurants like Cava that offer filling meals for reasonable prices should see significant growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Philippa Main\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nPhilippa Main is a real estate agent in Virginia and Florida who also does freelance writing, editing, and business development and marketing.

        "content": "Shareholders approved Chipotle's historic 50-for-1 stock split at the company's annual meeting (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nChipotle (CMG)\n\nShares in Chipotle were higher in pre-market trading as investors are looking forward to its upcoming 50-to-1 stock split.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill announced back in March a stock split with one of the biggest multiples ever: Each current share will be split into 50 new shares.\n\nThis means that when markets open on June 26, shareholders will own 50 times as many shares as they did at the close of trading on June 25, but the price of each one will be about one-fiftieth of what it was before.\n\nChief financial officer and chief administrative officer Jack Hartung said the move would help the company \"reward our team members and empower them to have ownership in our company.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe company has been red-hot this year, gaining about 70% since last November. TD Cowen has raised its price target for Chipotle from $3,500 (\u00a32761.32) to $3,600, signalling a potential upside of 10%.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European equities snap losing streak as London regains stock market crown\n\nRowan Street Capital are also optimistic about the fast-food chain prospects.\n\n\u201cThe best investment ideas are simple.

The stock is up 10x since we first invested at the end of 2017 (~47% annualized),\u201d their analysts wrote.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK)\n\nActivist Starboard Value bought a roughly $500m stake in Autodesk, and is pushing for changes at the design-software maker, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.\n\nStarboard has reportedly held meetings with Autodesk executives in the past few weeks to express their concerns and suggest changes, including enhancing its margins, implementing changes to its board and the management of a recent accounting investigation that negatively impacted the stock.\n\nStarboard criticised Autodesk in private conversations with the company for not disclosing the investigation and other material updates until after the company's window for shareholders to nominate director candidates closed in late March, according to the WSJ.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is considering taking legal action to ask for Autodesk's director nomination window to be reopened and for the design-software maker's annual shareholder meeting, currently set for July 16, to be delayed, the report added.\n\nShopify (SHOP)\n\nShopify got a boost on Friday after an analyst at Evercore ISI said now was the time to buy stock in the e-commerce company with shares down this year but the price is being corrected as it remains in the red during pre-market trading.\n\nEvercore has upgraded the rating of SHOP shares to Outperform, setting a price target of $75. This decision comes after a significant drop in the stock\u2019s value, approximately 30% from its 52-week high.\n\nOutperform at Evercore means \u201cthe total forecasted return is expected to be greater than the expected total return of the analyst's coverage sector.\u201d\n\nRead more: UK housing market steadies despite election uncertainty\n\nThe analyst wrote in a research note that the recent pullback in the stock provides an attractive entry point. Shares of Shopify have dropped 16% this year.\n\nRentokil (RTO.L)\n\nPest control and hygiene firm Rentokil is one of the best performing stocks in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) this session on the back of a note from RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAnalysts updated their earnings forecasts for forex (-1% to -2%), and expect first-half results to be in line with the market's expectations, \"with acceleration of US organic growth through this year\".\n\nThe stock has also been boosted after activist investor Nelson Peltz amassed a \u201csignificant\u201d stake in the company and has \u201creached out to discuss ideas and initiatives to improve shareholder value\u201d.\n\nRentokil has been a volatile stock, with the London-listed business struggling in recent years, with its expansion into the US falling flat on softer demand for its products.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Peltz is likely to facilitate a big shake-up at the business.\n\n\"[Rentokil] has struggled in comparison with its US peer Rollins, both in share price terms and financial performance,\" he says.\n\n\"Given Rentokil does have a large chunk of its business across the Atlantic this could include a push to shift its primary listing to the US.\"\n\nWatch: Tesla board should take on an 'independent, active' role<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA\\\">TSLA</a>) shareholders voted in approval of CEO Elon Musk's pay package.</p>\\n<p>\\\"That's a pretty remarkable statement of confidence on their part.

        "title": "Chipotle's Stock Split Is Almost Here: Time to Buy Now Before It Happens?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) is having a moment. The company's stock has been red-hot this year, gaining about 70% since last November. And now, investors are looking forward to its upcoming 50-to-1 stock split. When markets open on June 26, shareholders will own 50 times as many shares as they did at the close of trading on June 25, but the price of each one will be about one-fiftieth of what it was before. The stock split won't change the value of people's investments or the valuation of the company -- at least, not in and of itself.\n\nIt will, however, make the shares somewhat more accessible to smaller retail investors, including Chipotle's employees. Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer Jack Hartung said the move would help the company \"reward our team members and empower them to have ownership in our company.\" And as shares become more accessible, demand for them could increase, which could add to the momentum behind the stock.\n\nRegardless of the direct and indirect impacts of a split, the question remains: Is Chipotle a good investment at its current valuation?\n\nImpressive growth\n\nGrowing revenues consistently, especially at double-digit percentage rates, is one of the surest ways to get Wall Street to love a company. Chipotle has been doing just that at a time when many of its competitors are struggling. Take a look at this table, which shows Chipotle's top-line growth for the last five years compared to McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) and Yum! Brands(NYSE: YUM), the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and The Habit Burger Grill.\n\nCompany 2019 Revenue Growth 2020 Revenue Growth 2021 Revenue Growth 2022 Revenue Growth 2023 Revenue Growth Chipotle 14.8% 7.1% 26.1% 14.4% 14.3% McDonald's (0.5%) (10.1%) 20.9% (0.2%) 10% Yum! Brands (1.6%) 1% 16.5% 3.9% 3.4%\n\nData sources: Company filings.\n\nThe only year Chipotle didn't post double-digit percentage growth was 2020. (I think we might know why.) Still, despite pandemic lockdowns, it achieved growth of more than 7% during a year when McDonald's revenue shrank by more than 10%.\n\nThe story is similar for net income. Chipotle has more than doubled its earnings since 2021, well outpacing its peers. MCD Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nWhile top-line growth is important to investors, though, it's not everything.\n\nChipotle's valuation should give you pause\n\nChipotle currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67.7. That's pretty high for the restaurant industry. McDonald's and Yum! both trade at ratios just above 20.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, investors are often willing to pay a premium for a stock based on the expectation of earnings growth.\n\nTo weigh that, they look to its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which you get by dividing the company's P/E by its expected growth rate over a given period. This provides a better idea of a company's value relative to its forecast future earnings. In this case, lower (but not negative) is better, and a stock with a PEG ratio below 1 is generally viewed as being undervalued.\n\nChipotle's PEG ratio is 2.5, which is in line with McDonald's 2.9 and Yum! Brands' 2.2. So on a forward-looking basis, maybe it's not as overvalued as it might appear to be.\n\nYet one weakness of the PEG ratio is its reliance on earnings growth forecasts -- there's no guarantee those predictions will prove accurate. If, for example, the economy turns and consumers pull back on their discretionary spending, restaurant sales will dip. Although in that circumstance, all three of these companies would likely suffer, a dip in sales could hit Chipotle's stock harder because it would expose its current overvaluation. Why buy a stock trading at a premium if there isn't an expectation that future earnings will justify it?\n\nIt's also worth considering that Chipotle's revenues have been boosted by the company's aggressive expansion. It opened 271 new locations last year alone. However, comparable-store sales -- which don't factor in the impact of adding more stores -- grew by just 7.9%. That rate was lower than McDonald's 9% comps growth.\n\nDespite TikTok pushback, Chipotle still seems to be on track\n\nCurrently, Chipotle is catching some heat from social media users who've been accusing it of reducing its portion sizes to maximize profits. In response, some customers have been using their smartphones to record the store workers preparing their burritos and bowls in an attempt to either prove the assertion or to induce the employees to be more generous with their scoops.\n\nThe company, meanwhile, has stated categorically, \"There have been no changes in our portion sizes,\" and added that management has \"reinforced proper portioning with our employees.\"\n\nWhether portion sizes have actually changed may be less relevant than consumer perception -- and consumer response. The kerfuffle hasn't seemed to impact the chain's numbers yet, but if it continues, it could. Chipotle built its brand, in part, on burritos that were bursting at the seams.\n\nRegardless of these concerns, Chipotle still seems to be doing a whole lot right. Given the growth it is delivering quarter after quarter and year after year, I'm inclined to look past its high valuation, but I'd also recommend exercising caution. Keep an eye on the TikTok protests, the company's response to them, and whether or not the issue has a material impact on revenues in the coming quarters. But outside of that concern, Chipotle continues to look like a good bet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investors load up on growth stocks hoping that they can outperform popular market indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. While it\u2019s possible for individual picks to exceed these funds, picking wrong can result in losses.\n\nSavvy investors have to navigate the potential of high returns with considerable downside. Truly, no growth stock can guarantee a high return. But you can increase your chances by seeking corporations with rising revenue and profit margins.\n\nWhile short-term momentum can result in sizable gains, a company\u2019s financial growth, balance sheet and catalysts determine its long-term returns. Investors who set lengthy time horizons can see more of those catalysts play out. You don\u2019t have to pursue speculative stocks to beat the market. Some corporations are already well-known and have been around for decades. Places you shop at regularly and companies you\u2019ve heard of several times can be the leaders in your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, these are some of the top growth stocks to consider.\n\nComfort Systems USA (FIX) Back View of the Head of the Project Holds Laptop and Discussing Product Details with Chief Engineer while They Walk Through Modern Factory., FR rents out these spaces in the U.S.\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nComfort Systems USA (NYSE:FIX) offers air conditioning installation, maintenance, repair and replacement services for commercial and industrial clients. The company has a very impressive dividend history, going from a quarterly payout of $0.20 per share to $0.30 per share in one year. The HVAC company usually raises its dividend at least twice per year.\n\nThe firm recently reported impressive results in the first quarter of 2024. Revenue increased by 31% year-over-year (YOY) to reach $1.54 billion. Meanwhile, net income grew by 68% YOY to reach $96.3 million. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Lane mentioned that the company\u2019s new acquisitions are off to great starts. Comfort Systems USA currently has a $5.91 billion backlog, which is a 33% YOY improvement from a $4.44 billion backlog in the same quarter last year.\n\nAlso, FIX has been outperforming the stock market. Shares are up by 50% year-to-date (YTD) and have gained 517% over the past five years. It trades at a 30 P/E ratio and offers a 0.39% yield.

The fast food restaurant chain offers healthier food choices than competitors, which has helped Chipotle outperform the stock market. Shares are up by 43% YTD and have soared by 352% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst quarter results suggest that the trend will continue. Revenue increased by 14.1% YOY to $2.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share came to $13.01 per share which is a 23.9% YOY boost. Also, Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants during the quarter and remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants this year.\n\nThe stock has attracted more attention due to its upcoming 50-for-1 stock split. This split will make the price per share more affordable for people who prefer to own large quantities of entire shares versus a fractional share. The upcoming split will also increase options trading activity for the stock which will lead to more volatility.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

        "title": "Chipotle Shareholders Approve Its Historic 50-for-1 Stock Split. Here's What Happens Next.",
        "content": "Chipotle(NYSE: CMG) is one step closer to the finish line of its historic stock split. At its annual meeting of shareholders held on June 6, 2024, shareholders approved the measure, paving the way for its 50-for-1 stock split to take place later this month.\n\nThere are a few important dates for shareholders to remember. Let's review the particulars so investors will be prepared for the upcoming stock split. Image source: Chipotle.\n\nMark your calendar\n\nChipotle's press release cited several key dates shareholders should mark on their calendars.\n\nThe first key date was the annual meeting that took place on June 6, when shareholders voted on the stock split, which the company noted was \"one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange history.\" The company said that \"shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of its common stock,\" which marks an important milestone in the process.\n\nThe second key date noted by Chipotle management is the record date. Each shareholder of record as of the close of business on Tuesday, June 25 will be entitled to take part in the upcoming stock split, receiving 49 additional shares for every share they currently own.\n\nThe third key date is the distribution date. After the close of business on Tuesday, June 25, 2024, each shareholder will receive the newly minted shares. This officially takes place after the market closes, and the additional shares will automatically be deposited to shareholders' brokerage accounts.\n\nIf you're already a Chipotle stockholder, you don't need to do anything more to receive the additional shares. However, it's important to remember that the process can vary from brokerage to brokerage, so some investors might notice a lag of hours or even days before the additional shares show up in your account.\n\nFinally, Wednesday, June 26, is the date Chipotle will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis. Investors should expect shares to trade at roughly one-fiftieth of the price before the split occurred. For example, for each share they own recently worth $3,250, post-split investors will own 50 shares worth roughly $65 each.\n\nBut is the stock a buy?\n\nThere's little question that Chipotle has become synonymous with fresh ingredients, and the company is a leader in the fast-casual dining space. This has helped the stock climb an impressive 43% so far this year. Looking further back, early investors were treated to mind-boggling returns, with the stock up more than 14,742% (as of this writing) since its IPO in 2006. With the stock split on the horizon, and the stock trading near record highs, investors are faced with the quintessential investing question: Is the stock a buy, or has the opportunity passed?\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite Chipotle's impressive march higher, there's still much more opportunity ahead for the burrito purveyor, as evidenced by its recent financial report. In the first quarter, Chipotle generated revenue of $2.7 billion, up 14% year over year, resulting in diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $13.01, up 24%. It's always telling when EPS outpaces revenue growth, as that's a sign that a business' scale and leverage is such that it drops more profits to the bottom line.\n\nFurthermore, Chipotle's comparable restaurant sales (or comps) increased 7%, driven by transactions that jumped 5%, while the average check increased 2%. The company also continues to squeeze more revenue out of each location, as average restaurant sales increased 2%.\n\nChipotle had 3,479 restaurants at the end of the first quarter, but management is ultimately targeting 7,000 locations in North America. While international growth has taken a back seat to its domestic push, there's also still plenty of opportunity abroad.\n\nDespite the stock hitting an all-time high this week, some on Wall Street believe there's much more to come. Analysts at Goldman Sachs(NYSE: GS) called Chipotle a \"top idea,\" assigning a buy rating and a price target of $3,730. This represents potential gains for investors of 18% over the coming year, compared to the stock's closing price on Wednesday. The analyst cited Chipotle's \"ability to scale the business in a highly profitable manner without losing grip on the core operations, including the quality of food/customer experience.\"\n\nTaken together, the company's robust results, its vast opportunity, and Wall Street's increasingly bullish take illustrate that Chipotle has a long runway of growth ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) has been one of the best-performing restaurant stocks over the last 15 years. While early investors have made a lot of money even off a small investment, newer investors should still be encouraged by Chipotle's recent business performance and its impact on the stock's return.\n\nEarnings per share surged 540% over the last five years. That massive increase in profitability helped drive the share price up 346%, which would have turned a $10,000 investment into $44,670. Management's focus on profitably expanding the store base means the stock's run is unlikely to be over.\n\nChipotle can keep growing\n\nChipotle just turned in another impressive report for the first quarter. Revenue jumped 14% year over year, while adjusted earnings increased 27%. Management sees full-year comparable-restaurant sales rising in the mid- to high-single-digit range, which should translate into double-digit growth in revenue and earnings.\n\nManagement's focus is driving profitable growth for shareholders. This is why investors should get excited about the company's plan to accelerate store openings.\n\nThe company opened 47 new restaurants in the first quarter, bringing the total footprint to nearly 3,500 stores across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, and Germany. It plans to open between 285 to 315 new locations for the year on its way to reaching its long-term target of having 7,000 restaurants in North America.\n\nChipotle has proven to be a top-tier restaurant business. It survived a major crisis in 2015 around food-borne illnesses associated with its restaurants, and most recently, the pandemic and spiking inflation.\n\nIf a restaurant can overcome those challenges, chances are it will continue to reward shareholders for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Too Late To Consider Buying Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) saw a significant share price rise of 23% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nIs Chipotle Mexican Grill Still Cheap?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. We find that Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s ratio of 69.32x is above its peer average of 19.52x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Hospitality industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat does the future of Chipotle Mexican Grill look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Chipotle Mexican Grill's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 74%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? CMG\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe CMG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on CMG for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for CMG, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

        "content": "We recently compiled the list of the 10 Stocks Wall Street Analysts Upgraded. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\u00a0stands against the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. But first, we are going to take a look at what the markets are doing.\n\nGlobal financial markets reacted with volatility today as the yen stumbled against the dollar, marking a significant decline after the Bank of Japan's cautious stance on reducing bond purchases. European stock futures, in contrast, showed signs of recovery following Thursday's substantial selloff, while Asian markets painted a mixed picture with losses in Australian and Chinese shares juxtaposed against gains in Korean equities. The yen experienced a notable decline against the dollar following the Bank of Japan's announcement of a delay in detailing its plans for reducing bond purchases, leading to a surge in Japanese sovereign bond futures.\n\nThis move came amidst contrasting market reactions across different regions on Thursday. While European stock futures saw gains recovering from the previous day's heavy sell-off, Asian markets faced mixed fortunes: Australian and Chinese shares retreated, while Korean stocks advanced. Specifically, the yen dropped by as much as 0.6% to 157.98 against the dollar initially, although it later recovered some of its losses. This development triggered significant movements in bond markets, where benchmark 10-year bonds saw yields plummeting to 0.915% as futures surged, marking the most substantial increase since late December. The Bank of Japan's decision to delay specifics on reducing debt purchases until its next policy meeting underscored lingering uncertainties in the financial landscape. This cautious approach prompted traders to recalibrate expectations for an imminent rate hike, as reflected in reduced bets within the swaps market. In parallel, Japanese equities displayed resilience amid the broader regional downturn, with the Topix Index surging by up to 0.9%. The overall market sentiment reflected a cautious optimism tempered by the central bank's deferred actions, highlighting the nuanced responses in global financial markets amidst ongoing economic adjustments and policy recalibrations.\n\nIn the current quarter, Bitcoin is facing stiff competition from traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which have outperformed the cryptocurrency amidst growing skepticism about its rebound prospects. JPMorgan strategists have raised concerns over a potential slowdown in inflows into the crypto market, highlighting broader doubts about its sustained growth. As of midday Friday in Singapore, Bitcoin has seen a decline of approximately 5% since the beginning of April, trailing behind global equity indices, fixed income benchmarks, and even commodities like gold. This underperformance underscores a shifting sentiment in financial markets, where investors appear to be favoring more established asset classes over the volatility and uncertainty associated with digital currencies. The contrast in performance between Bitcoin and traditional investments reflects a cautious stance among market participants, who are closely monitoring developments in both economic policy and regulatory environments that could further impact the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. This dynamic landscape suggests a recalibration of investment strategies amid evolving market conditions and changing perceptions of risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nThailand\u2019s Government Pension Fund is banking on a diversified strategy centered around gold, commodities, and private equity to offset lackluster performance in domestic stocks, amid challenging market conditions in recent times. According to Songpol Chevapanyaroj, the secretary-general of the state pension fund, the portfolio is poised to deliver returns exceeding 3% for the year 2024, a notable improvement from the 1.5% achieved in 2023. This optimistic outlook reflects strategic shifts within the fund, including increased allocations to gold and commodities. These investments are positioned as hedges against inflationary pressures and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, enhancing the fund's resilience against market volatilities. The decision underscores a proactive approach by Thailand\u2019s Government Pension Fund to navigate through economic uncertainties and optimize returns in a diversified investment landscape. By diversifying into alternative assets alongside traditional holdings, the fund aims to strengthen its financial position and achieve sustainable growth amid evolving global economic dynamics.\n\nDuring the week leading up to Wednesday, investors shifted their focus within the U.S. equity market, favoring growth stocks while shedding value stocks, reports BofA Global Research. This movement coincided with unexpected stability in the U.S. consumer price index data for May, which contributed to a decline in bond yields and heightened expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. According to BofA, there was a significant influx of $1.8 billion into U.S. growth stock funds, contrasted by $2.6 billion in outflows from U.S. value stocks during the same period. This trend underscores a preference among investors for sectors and companies expected to thrive in a low-interest-rate environment, where growth stocks historically perform well.\n\nIn addition to these equity shifts, the report highlights broader movements in financial markets. Investors allocated approximately $40 billion into cash, reflecting a cautious stance amidst market uncertainties. Concurrently, there was notable demand for U.S. Treasuries, with $1.8 billion flowing into these safe-haven assets, alongside $7.7 billion directed towards investment-grade bonds. The Federal Reserve's revised forecast of potentially one rate cut this year, down from earlier expectations of three cuts, further influenced market sentiment. This adjustment in monetary policy outlooks likely played a role in reshaping investor strategies and asset allocations throughout the week. Overall, the dynamics observed in U.S. equity flows and bond markets reflect a nuanced response to economic data and central bank signals, highlighting investors' adaptability amidst evolving financial conditions and expectations.\n\nIn our original article we listed 10 companies whose price targets were raised by analysts and ranked them by their upside potential by comparing their current market price with the raised price target.\n\n08. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\n\nUpside Potential: 10%\n\nAs of June 13, TD Cowen has raised its price target for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

This adjustment reflects TD Cowen's optimistic view on Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) future performance and growth prospects, driven by several key factors. Firstly, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) has delivered strong financial results, marked by significant increases in both revenue and profit. The introduction of innovative menu items has resonated well with customers, driving higher foot traffic and sales volumes. Furthermore, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) strategic investments in digital platforms and delivery services have expanded its market reach and enhanced convenience for consumers.\n\nOperational enhancements in efficiency and supply chain management have also played a pivotal role in boosting profit margins. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) well-established brand strength and loyal customer base contribute significantly to its competitive position and potential for growth. TD Cowen's decision to raise the price target underscores their confidence in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) ability to capitalize on these strengths amidst a favorable economic environment. This strategic alignment positions Chipotle to sustain its momentum and expand its business in the years ahead, reaffirming TD Cowen's positive outlook on the company's trajectory.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe best investment ideas are simple. We have previously written about\u00a0Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG). It turned out that this was our best investment idea since starting the fund. The stock is up 10x since we first invested at the end of 2017 (~47% annualized). Sounds absolutely incredible, except that your managers sold CMG back in 2018 (thinking that the stock had gotten ahead of itself), and proudly booked an 85% profit in 6 months, patting ourselves in the back. Interestingly, when we wrote about this in our 2019 letter, describing our big mistake to sell, the stock still went up +270% since that letter, delivering an impressive 30% annual return. This is an incredibly important point! You do not get many Chipotles in your investing career. Companies like these are super rare and the opportunity to buy them at an attractive price (which we got in 2017) is even rarer. Booking a quick profit, paying the capital gains tax and thinking that you will find another CMG to invest your proceeds into is usually delusional.\n\nAlong with our personal investment case of CMG, let us compare that to the experience that Bill Ackman had with the same investment. He is a famous hedge fund manager that we greatly admire, who has achieved an incredible track record in the past 20 years running Pershing Square. Bill Ackman has owned the restaurant stock since the third quarter of 2016 at an initial cost basis of about $411 per share (our cost basis was $289). Originally, Mr. Ackman bought 2.88 million shares. He was wise to hold on to CMG stock and it still is the top position in his fund (18% weight). But, if you follow his 13F filings, which are the public filings disclosing large investment manager\u2019s holdings of publicly traded securities, he kept trimming his position as the stock went up. We calculated that if he just sat on his original 2.88 million shares and didn\u2019t sell a share, his position would be worth $8.8 billion today. This would represent ~50% of his entire firms\u2019 assets under management (AUM). But he only has $1.8 billion invested in CMG as of Q1 2024. As Charlie Munger said: \u201c\u201cThe first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.\u201d\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, CMG ranks 8th among the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. You can visit Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets to see the other stocks whose price targets analysts recently raised. While we acknowledge the potential of CMG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CMG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The 7 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Retirement may feel distant, but it\u2019s important to save up now. Accumulating more money will give you more choices when you are ready to retire. Even if you want to work forever, extra cash gives you more options about the type of work that you pursue.\n\nRetirement stocks can help investors reach their long-term financial goals sooner. Capital gains and dividends can lead to a higher net worth. Solid retirement stocks like the ones on this list can generate those results. These stocks have impressive records and have been around for a while. There\u2019s a time and place for high-risk, high-reward investment opportunities, but retirement stocks tend to offer more stability.\n\nInvestors should look for companies with multiple decades of experience, rising revenue, and improving profit margins. These components are the foundation for many top-tier retirement stocks. The stock market offers many choices, but investors who want stability and have multi-decade time horizons may want to consider these picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) GOOG stock: letters spelling out google\n\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) combines value with growth. The tech giant trades at a 27.5x price-to-earnings ratio while offering a 0.45% yield for investors. Shares are up by 27% year to date and gained 226% over the past five years.\n\nWhile the company makes most of its revenue from advertising, Google Cloud has become a larger segment of the corporation\u2019s business model. Google Cloud made up over 10% of the company\u2019s revenue in the first quarter. The quarter also featured 15% revenue growth from a year ago and 57% net income growth.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s net income should continue to exhibit an elevated growth rate as the company trims costs and becomes more efficient. Artificial intelligence can also lead to more revenue growth for the company. Gemini is Alphabet\u2019s response to ChatGPT, and AI can also increase demand for cloud computing platforms. A potential acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) would expand Alphabet\u2019s offerings and can help the company reach new heights.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s (NASDAQ:CRWD) current valuation doesn\u2019t resemble a retirement stock. The company trades at a P/E ratio north of 700x, but its 87x forward P/E ratio makes it look more reasonable.\n\nCrowdstrike continues to achieve impressive revenue growth while many competitors are struggling. Revenue increased by 33% year over year to reach $921 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Annual recurring revenue grew at the same rate, reaching $3.65 billion. Crowdstrike\u2019s annual recurring revenue gives it a good foundation to deliver compelling growth rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income has been surging for the cybersecurity firm, and that can result in a more favorable P/E ratio for patient investors. Crowdstrike reported $500,000 in GAAP net income in Q1 2023. Meanwhile, GAAP net income came to $42.8 million in Q1 2024. Companies will have to invest more money to strengthen their digital defenses. Crowdstrike looks like a top beneficiary of this trend, and investors with a five- to 10-year horizon can be greatly rewarded.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NYSE:TXRH) is a steakhouse restaurant chain with fast-food restaurants. The company presents \u201cgrowth at a reasonable price,\u201d as it trades at a P/E ratio of 34x. Other fast-growing restaurant stocks have much higher P/E ratios. Texas Roadhouse stock is up by 42% in 2024 and has more than tripled over the past five years. Investors receive a 1.4% yield while they wait for the stock price to rally.\n\nRecent financial results suggest Texas Roadhouse can continue with its growth streak. Revenue increased by 12.5% year over year in the first quarter while net income sprang up by 31.4% year over year. Texas Roadhouse commanded an 8.4% year-over-year increase in comparable restaurant sales at company-owned restaurants. Comparable franchise restaurant sales were up by 7.7% year over year.\n\nTexas Roadhouse currently has 753 total restaurants. The split comes to 644 company-owned restaurants and 109 franchise-owned restaurants. The restaurant chain opened 12 additional restaurants this quarter.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to diversify into multiple fast-food restaurant stocks, you may also want to consider Chipotle (NYSE:CMG). The restaurant chain has healthier food options than most fast food giants. This distinction helped Chipotle set higher prices for its food without losing customers.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock is up by 39% year-to-date leading to its 50-for-1 stock split that will take effect June 26. Shares also gained 322% over the past five years. Financials continue to be an area of strength for the chain. Revenue increased by 14.1% in the last year to $2.7 billion in the first quarter. Net income grew by 23.2% to $359.3 million. Chipotle closed the quarter with a 13.3% net profit margin, which is above average.\n\nChipotle remains on pace to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year. Each time Chipotle opens that many restaurants, the company puts itself in a good financial position to open more in the following years. It\u2019s feasible to see Chipotle open more than 1,000 new restaurants before 2030. That development should result in meaningful gains for long-term investors.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a leading credit and debit card issuer that charges a percentage of every transaction. These plastic cards are more convenient than cash and offer enticing rewards and enhanced security.\n\nDebit and credit cards will be used across multiple generations, and that should result in steady revenue growth for Visa. The fintech firm reported 10% year-over-year improvements to its revenue and net income in the second quarter . Visa\u2019s leadership regularly rewards shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. The company allocated $3.8 billion in the most recent quarter toward those initiatives.\n\nVisa only has a 0.7% yield, but it maintained an annualized 18% growth rate over the past decade. This high growth rate can result in significant cash flow by the time you are ready to retire. Visa stock is up by 6% year to date and gained 62% over the past five years. The firm regularly has net profit margins that exceed 50%.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) outperformed the S&P 500 with a 26% year-to-date gain. Shares of the global retailer are up by 84% over the past five years. While Walmart is a reliable resource for groceries and affordable prices, the company is dabbling in two verticals that can stimulate growth.\n\nE-commerce is the first exciting opportunity. While Walmart reported 6% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, e-commerce was up by 21%. Walmart\u2019s continued success in e-commerce can help it compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and it can gobble up market share from Target (NYSE:TGT).\n\nWalmart\u2019s advertising segment is another area of strength, but it will take longer for advertising to meaningfully impact Walmart\u2019s financials. Advertising increased by 24% year over year, including a 26% growth rate for Walmart Connect in the U.S. Investors with lengthy time horizons can see advertising impact Walmart\u2019s profit margins meaningfully. Most of Walmart\u2019s business model revolves around low-margin sales. Growth in Walmart\u2019s advertising segment should translate into healthier profit margins.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been a top online advertising stock for several years. While a poor 2022 resulted in a meaningful price cut, the company flipped the script last year and recently touched an all-time high. Shares are up by 45% year-to-date and gained 177% over the past five years.\n\nJust like Alphabet, Meta Platforms trades at a reasonable valuation. Meta Platforms has a P/E of 29x and offers a 0.4% yield. Recent financial results suggest that Meta Platforms can become more affordable for long-term investors.\n\nRevenue increased by 27% year over year while net income was up by 117%. Meta Platforms continues to trim its headcount, which is 10% lower now than it was last year. Meta Platforms also wrapped up the quarter with $58.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The social media giant has plenty of capital to invest in new ventures while generating healthy profit margins for its investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG, CRWD, and TXRH.

        "title": "Cava Is Worth $33 Million Per Restaurant After Blistering Debut",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Of all the hot IPOs over the past year \u2014 AI firms and biotech startups and the like \u2014 none has popped on Wall Street quite like Cava Group Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019 Tesla Investors Back Musk\u2019s $56 Billion Pay Deal, Texas Move Apple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Hunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad\u2019s Reaction Was Remarkable. Tech Powers Stocks as Adobe Surges in Late Trading: Markets Wrap\n\nThe restaurant chain \u2014 the Mediterranean Chipotle, as its financial backers like to call it \u2014 has soared more than 300% since its initial public offering in June 2023, giving it a market valuation of over $10 billion. That equates to $33 million for each of its 323 restaurants, a staggering sum even for a chain that\u2019s rapidly expanding. By comparison, investors valued Chipotle Mexican Grill, the benchmark in the US fast-casual restaurant industry, at just about $3 million per restaurant when it completed the one-year mark in public markets. (On a price-to-earnings ratio, Cava is expensive, too, clocking in at 185.)\n\nAll of this highlights how the global IPO market is cracking back open after a couple of sluggish years. Bring the right kinds of new stocks to market, like a trendy fast-casual chain, and investors will bid them up.\n\nBut the rally has been so extreme that it\u2019s starting to cause angst among some Cava bulls. In the span of just four days, two of the 15 Wall Street analysts who cover the company \u2014 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s John Ivankoe and Piper Sandler\u2019s Brian Mullan \u2014 cut the stock to neutral from overweight.\n\nThe per-restaurant valuation \u201cis unprecedented\u201d in the industry, Ivankoe wrote in his June 3 report. Each location, he noted, currently pulls in less than $3 million a year on average in revenue. He told clients he\u2019d rather buy Chipotle stock at this point, underscoring a broader trend: two-thirds of analysts have buy ratings on Chipotle versus just over half now for Cava.\n\nSome corporate insiders have also recently sold chunks of their Cava stock. For the most part, though, investors remain willing to accept such lofty valuations. Even after a sluggish start to June, Cava is up more than 100% this year. Fast casual is popular with the Wall Street set now, and Cava, as they see it, is the up-and-comer that will trace Chipotle\u2019s arc.\n\n\u201cInvestors are willing to pay a premium for these growth-oriented concepts,\u201d said Jim Salera, an analyst who covers restaurant stocks at Stephens. Salera, who doesn\u2019t have a rating on Cava, says they\u2019ll \u201cpay that premium because there\u2019s only a handful of restaurants that are providing growth.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Lauren Balik, the CEO and founder of research firm Upright Analytics, the whole Cava-is-the-next Chipotle narrative is complicated. Yes, she says, Cava could expand rapidly like Chipotle did \u2014 the company plans to have 1,000 restaurants in operation within a decade \u2014 and business could boom, but that growth brings its own risks. Chipotle struggled to standardize hygienic conditions as it quickly added restaurants, triggering a series of food-poisoning incidents that made national news and cratered the stock in 2015. It took Chipotle a while to fix its procedures, and the stock only began to rebound two years later.\n\nCava has managed to avoid such problems, opening more than 50 locations in the past year without any notable quality issues. Still, Balik says, it\u2019s a good reminder that rapid growth can cause operational hiccups. She\u2019s betting against the stock, having put on a short trade in January.\n\n\u201cEveryone makes the comparison to Chipotle. If you make that comparison, you have to compare Cava to early Chipotle, which was a similar story,\u201d Balik says. \u201cIt opened a lot of new stores, it grew quickly, but the operations and execution in late 2015 didn\u2019t work that well.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War Grieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Chipotle, McDonald's initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nWolfe Research upgraded 3M (MMM) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $125 price target. The company's new CEO Bill Brown \"brings The Right Stuff to 3M,\" providing more confidence in the medium-term earnings outlook, the firm tells investors in a research note. Stephens upgraded Par Technology(PAR) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $60, up from $46. As a category leader in restaurant technology, Par is well positioned to capitalize on demand for loyalty, cloud-native POS and data-analytics solutions, the firm says, adding that it believes the sale of government subsidiaries simplifies the story and adds valuable capital flexibility. BofA double upgraded Kimberly-Clark(KMB) to Buy from Underperform with a price target of $160, up from $115. After Kimberly-Clark's volume inflection in Q1 following two years of volume declines, the firm sees the start of a longer-term improvement taking hold. Janney Montgomery Scott upgraded MAA (MAA) to Buy from Neutral with a $150 fair value estimate. After meeting with management, the firm is more confident in apartment real estate investment trust's near-term operating trends, and less concerned about the new supply still pervasive in MAA's core markets. Bradesco BBI upgraded PagBank (PAGS) to Outperform from Neutral with a $16 price target. The firm cites the company's higher profitability and \"attractive\" valuation for the upgrade.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nWolfe Research downgraded Roper Technologies (ROP) to Peer Perform from Outperform without a price target. The firm finds the stock's valuation more balanced, and sees a less clear path for future estimate revisions. Canaccord downgraded Cara Therapeutics(CARA) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $1, down from $10. The company announced that oral difelikefalin did not demonstrate meaningful clinical benefit versus placebo at any dose as part of the dose-finding Part A of its KOURAGE Phase 3 study in notalgia paresthetica. H.C. Wainwright and Needham also downgraded Cara Therapeutics to Neutral-equivalent ratings. Barclays downgraded NextEra Energy Partners(NEP) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $25, down from $32. With limited debt capacity should the company want to stay within its credit ratings, and an \"extremely high\" payout ratio of 95%, NextEra has limited potential options outside a distribution cut, with a reduction of at least 45% necessary, to pay off its remaining convertible equity portfolio financings, the firm tells investors in a research note. Janney Montgomery Scott downgraded Generac (GNRC) to Neutral from Buy with a fair value estimate of $154, up from $126, after having recently hosted a Fireside Chat with CFO York Ragen and Director of IR Kris Roseman. Following the management talks and a review of the firm's model, the firm thinks additional multiple expansion is unlikely and would like to receive additional clarity regarding the 2025-plus rollout of updated energy technology products before ratcheting up estimates. Goldman Sachs downgraded W. R. Berkley(WRB) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $83, down from $88. The firm says recent litigation trends, inclusive of multi-year highs in U.S. district court cases pending, bring an \"element of uncertainty\" with regard to claim cost trends, especially given increasing levels of large verdicts.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nGoldman Sachs initiated coverage of Chipotle (CMG) with a Buy rating and $3,730 price target. The firm initiated coverage of the restaurant sector with a \"selectively constructive\" view. Goldman's top idea is Chipotle Mexican Grill. The firm also started coverage of Restaurant Brands (QSR), Sweetgreen (SG), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), and Starbucks (SBUX) with Buy ratings. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of McDonald's(MCD) with a Neutral rating and $288 price target. The firm sees a balanced risk/reward for McDonald's given near-term risks from its national $5 value menu launch. Goldman also started coverage of Yum! Brands (YUM) and Wingstop (WING) with Neutral ratings. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Wendy's(WEN) with a Sell rating and $16 price target. The firm believes scale increasingly matters in a tougher competitive environment and sees multiple challenges in view of lower income consumer uncertainties and intensifying value competition. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Jack in the Box (JACK) with a Sell rating and $55 price target. Argus initiated coverage of GE Vernova(GEV) with a Buy rating and $190 price target. GE Vernova is a well-run, financially strong company that looks to be \"well poised\" to take advantage of megatrends such as energy transition, global electrification and global decarbonization, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays initiated coverage of NetEase (NTES) with an Equal Weight rating and $104 price target. The firm says China's online gaming market is maturing, while NetEase has high-market share and potentially peak margins.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) the Best Restaurant Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Ackman?",
        "content": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Bill Ackman's 2024 Portfolio: 6 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024. Since Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) ranks 1st in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire\u00a0Bill Ackman recently made headlines after reports suggested he plans to take his investment firm public as soon as next year. A Wall Street Journal report said the 58-year-old billionaire was selling a stake in Pershing Square to investors as part of a funding round that could value the firm at about $10.5 billion. According to data from WSJ, Pershing Square managed over $16 billion in assets as of the end of April. The publication said Ackman has told investors that he plans to at least quadruple assets under management.\n\nAckman has run a concentrated portfolio for years. As of the end of the March quarter this year, his portfolio was worth over $10 billion, with just seven stocks. And yet Ackman made $610 million last year, coming in at the seventh position in Bloomberg\u2019s annual list of the best-paid hedge fund founders.\n\nIn 2022, Ackman, who writes long and fiery posts on Twitter, announced that he was done with activist investing and was taking a \u201cquieter approach.\u201d In 2023, Pershing Square Holdings generated strong NAV performance of 26.7% versus 26.3% for its principal benchmark, the S&P 500 index.\n\nAckman talked in detail about the fund\u2019s returns and future strategy during his 2023\u00a0letter to investors:\n\n\u201cWhile our investments in hedging and asymmetric instruments have been enormously profitable, we could have done better. In each of the three black swan events of the last 20 years, we had an early and highly variant view of the likely impact and probability of their occurrence and had identified and invested in instruments that offered profits many times their cost. In retrospect, we should have invested more and achieved even greater profits without risking materially more capital.\u201d\n\nFor this article we scanned Ackman\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked his top six stock holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) Billionaire Bill Ackman's Best Stock to Buy in 2024?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG)\n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman\u2019s Q1\u20192024 Stake Value: $2,162,590,372\n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman\u2019s hedge fund decreased its position in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) in the first quarter by 10%, ending the period with a $2.16 billion stake in the company. The restaurant chain is still the biggest holding of Pershing Square. In April, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) posted strong Q1 results, which showed revenue in the period jumped by 13.9% on a YoY basis, beating estimates by $30 million. Comparable sales in the quarter increased by 7%. For the full year, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) expects its comp sales to grow in the mid to high-single digit range. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) has been steadily increasing its footprint over the past several years. Back in 2007, the company had just 704 stores. This figure now stands at 3437. One of the biggest signs of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u2019s (NYSE:CMG) strengths is its rising margins, even when the restaurant industry is reeling from high labor costs and squeezing margins. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u2019s (NYSE:CMG) current net margin of 12.45% is the highest it has been in the past decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CMG)\u00a0trades at 47X 2025 EPS estimate of $66.92 set by Wall Street analysts. This P/E is much higher than the industry of 16. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CMG)\u00a0is expected to see revenue growth of just 13-15% per year over the next 3 years, while its EPS growth is expected to come in between 3% to 20%. Analysts expect the American consumer to remain prudent in spending amid higher for longer interest rate scenario and dwindling savings. Therefore, for investors looking for high-growth stock appreciation names, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc\u00a0(NYSE:CMG)\u00a0might not be the ideal choice.\n\nAverage analyst estimate for Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) is $3244.77, which presents just 3% upside potential from the current levels. That means the Wall Street believes the stock has reached its potential and based on current catalysts and growth trajectory it does not have any room to grow significantly.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe best investment ideas are simple. We have previously written about\u00a0Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG). It turned out that this was our best investment idea since starting the fund. The stock is up 10x since we first invested at the end of 2017 (~47% annualized). Sounds absolutely incredible, except that your managers sold CMG back in 2018 (thinking that the stock had gotten ahead of itself), and proudly booked an 85% profit in 6 months, patting ourselves in the back. Interestingly, when we wrote about this in our 2019 letter, describing our big mistake to sell, the stock still went up +270% since that letter, delivering an impressive 30% annual return. This is an incredibly important point! You do not get many Chipotles in your investing career. Companies like these are super rare and the opportunity to buy them at an attractive price (which we got in 2017) is even rarer. Booking a quick profit, paying the capital gains tax and thinking that you will find another CMG to invest your proceeds into is usually delusional.\n\nAlong with our personal investment case of CMG, let us compare that to the experience that Bill Ackman had with the same investment. He is a famous hedge fund manager that we greatly admire, who has achieved an incredible track record in the past 20 years running Pershing Square. Bill Ackman has owned the restaurant stock since the third quarter of 2016 at an initial cost basis of about $411 per share (our cost basis was $289). Originally, Mr. Ackman bought 2.88 million shares. He was wise to hold on to CMG stock and it still is the top position in his fund (18% weight). But, if you follow his 13F filings, which are the public filings disclosing large investment manager\u2019s holdings of publicly traded securities, he kept trimming his position as the stock went up. We calculated that if he just sat on his original 2.88 million shares and didn\u2019t sell a share, his position would be worth $8.8 billion today. This would represent ~50% of his entire firms\u2019 assets under management (AUM). But he only has $1.8 billion invested in CMG as of Q1 2024. As Charlie Munger said: \u201c\u201cThe first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.\u201d\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list of Billionaire Bill Ackman's 2024 Portfolio: 6 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024. You can visit Billionaire Bill Ackman's 2024 Portfolio: 6 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024 to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "The 3 Best Under $50 Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Stocks needn\u2019t be expensive to buy. In fact, stocks often attract more investors when their share price is affordable. Companies appear to acknowledge this fact, which is why many are splitting their stocks. Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just split its stock on a 10-for-1 basis, taking the share price down to $120 from $1,200. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) will split its stock later in June on a 50-for-1 basis.\n\nRight now, many stocks are trading for less than $50, putting them in reach of most investors. A lot of these stocks are of well-known blue-chip companies and are trading at fair valuations, with many of them also offering attractive dividends. Best of all, some of these affordable stocks have catalysts pushing their share prices higher. Here are the three best under $50 stocks to buy in June 2024.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of automotive giant General Motors (NYSE:GM) is currently trading just under $48 per share. The price might not be below $50 for long after the company announced a new $6 billion stock buyback program. The share repurchase comes as a $10 billion stock buyback program announced in November 2023 ends on June 30. A timeframe for completing the new share repurchases hasn\u2019t been announced.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Detroit automaker\u2019s commitment to its shareholders is admirable, especially coming after the company endured a costly strike last fall when employees represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union staged rotating strikes that temporarily shut down production. General Motors is also grappling with uncertainty surrounding consumer demand for electric vehicles, which the automaker has invested billions of dollars in.\n\nDespite the headaches, General Motors has managed to post strong financial results in recent quarters, putting it in a position to extend its stock buyback program. GM stock has increased 31% in the last 12 months.\n\nUBS Group (UBS) UBS (UBS) bank sign on gray stone wall with red and gray logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Judith Linine\n\nShares of Swiss banking giant UBS Group (NYSE:UBS) have risen 54% in the last 12 months but still trade for a little more than $30 per share. UBS stock currently looks cheap to buy, trading at only three times price/earnings. Now might be an opportune time to buy UBS stock, with the bank scheduled to complete its merger with former rival Credit Suisse by July 1 of this year.\n\nUBS, which acquired Credit Suisse in 2023 for $3.2 billion after the bank\u2019s collapse, had previously said the banks\u2019 combination would be completed by year\u2019s end. The accelerated takeover of Credit Suisse leaves Switzerland with one global bank that has a balance sheet twice as large as the country\u2019s economy. Going forward, UBS will be an international behemoth with nearly $6 trillion of assets under management.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to being cheap, UBS stock also pays a quarterly dividend of 17.5 cents per share, giving it a yield of over 2%.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) a southwest airline stocks (LUV) jet flying above the clouds\n\nSource: Carlos E. Santa Maria / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) have gotten beaten down since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. LUV stock today is trading 42% lower than where it was five years ago. At under $30 per share, the stock should be accessible to most investors. And now might be a good time to take a position with major changes coming to the airline. Southwest stock recently jumped 8% higher on news that activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a $1.9 billion stake in the carrier.\n\nPrivately held Elliott has become one of Southwest Airlines\u2019 largest shareholders and is demanding big changes at the underperforming company, including the ousting of CEO Robert Jordan and an overhaul of the board. Elliott Management says major changes are needed to reverse the prolonged slump in LUV stock. Investors appear to agree. With air travel in the U.S. back at record levels, many investors say it is unacceptable that Southwest\u2019s stock continues to underperform.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?",
        "content": "President and CEO of Nvidia Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, 2 June 2024. (Chiang Ying-ying, Associated Press)\n\nEarlier this week Nvidia (NVDA) completed a 10-for-1 stock split, following its original announcement in May. This means the company's share price is now trading around its lowest level since late 2022.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) firm is the sixth member of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to announce a stock split just this year, up from four in 2023.\n\nAnalysts believe this is a sign of more to come in the technology sector.\n\nThey have pointed to Meta Platforms Inc (META) as one of next companies to possibly announce a stock split. The tech conglomerate, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp is the only firm in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that has not yet split shares.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrading at over $500 a share, Meta is considered \u201cripe for a split,\u201d Ken Mahoney, president of Mahoney Asset Management, said.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock has surged more than 450% from its 2022 low, driven by AI interest, buybacks, and a new dividend.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nWhat is a stock split?\n\nA stock split is a decision by a company's board of directors to increase the number of shares outstanding by issuing more shares to current shareholders (without diluting the value of their stakes).\n\nThe number of outstanding shares rises and the price per share decreases proportionally, while the market capitalisation and value of the company stays the same.\n\nFor example, in a 2-for-1 stock split, a shareholder receives an additional share for each share held. So, if a company had 1 million shares outstanding before the split, it would have 2 million shares outstanding after a 2-for-1 split.\n\nIn Nvidia's case, the company split its shares on a 10-for-1 basis based on the closing share price on Friday 7 June of $1,210. Shareholders were awarded 10 shares for each of their existing shares, and the stock was trading at around $120 per share on Monday 10 June.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, reverse stock splits happen when a company reduces the number of shares outstanding, thereby raising the market price of each share.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy do they happen?\n\nStock splits often result in a share price increase as small investors and employees perceive the stock as more affordable. Retail traders in particular find this appealing as they may only be able to buy shares in full on their trading platforms or within ISAs, with limits on buying fractional shares.\n\nCompanies often perform stock splits to make their stock more accessible to a wider range of investors,\u201d explains Sam North, market analyst at investment platform eToro. \u201cA stock split can reduce the price per share, making it more affordable for individual investors to buy.\"\n\nLower share prices are also useful to companies when it comes to remunerating staff members with share options. The move also brings a company's share price to a similar range to others in the same sector.\n\nRead more: What are share repurchases?\n\nStock splits can often improve trading liquidity, effectively boosting demand for the stock and driving up prices.\n\nAnother possible reason for the price increase is that a stock split provides a signal to the market that the company's share price has been increasing over time \u2014 people may assume this growth will continue in the future. This further lifts demand and prices.\n\nReverse stock splits often happen when a company wants to meet the minimum requirements to remain listed on an exchange. Firms can get ousted off an exchange if their price drops too far, so the move can help a company survive and recover from a rough patch.\n\nRecent stock splits\n\nSeveral high-profile stock splits have taken place this year including Walmart (WMT), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Lam Research (LRCX), Sony Group (SONY), Amphenol Corporation (APH), and Cintas (CTAS).\n\nRetailer Walmart announced a 3-for-1 stock split on 30 January, and completed its first split in 25 years after the market closed on February 23, while Chipotle Mexican Grill approved a 50-for-1 split on March 19, which will take effect after the closing bell on 25 June.\n\nCorporate identity uniforms company Cintas approved a 4-for-1 stock split on 2 May 2and shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis after the market close on 11 September.\n\nSony's board greenlit a 5-for-1 stock split last month, which goes into effect on 8 October, while electronic components firm Amphenol revealed a 2-for-1 forward split on 20 May, which was completed on 11 June.\n\nWafer fabrication equipment company Lam Research also approved a 10-for-1 stock split, which will become effective after closing bell on 2 October.\n\nRead more: The stock market rally has been all about large caps\n\nIt comes as Amazon (AMZN) has so far split its stock three times in its history. The latest one was announced in March 2022 on a 20:1 basis.\n\nOther big-tech names such as Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) have also carried out stock splits in the past.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nInvestors should weigh up stock splits on a case-by-case basis. Overall, historical stats indicate that they tend to outperform the S&P 500 index over the next 12 months, but of course it can all be subject to change.\n\nHowever, stock splits like Nvidia, and now potentially Meta, can make them more attractive candidates for the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Currently, no stock in the Dow index trades above $500 a share.\n\nThe Bank of America (BoA) (BAC) has already predicted more splits in the tech sector, including the likes of Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI), KLA Corp (KLAC), and Netflix Inc (NFLX).\n\nWatch: What are SPACs?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Investors interested in Retail - Restaurants stocks are likely familiar with Compass Group PLC (CMPGY) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nCompass Group PLC has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Chipotle Mexican Grill has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CMPGY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CMG has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nCMPGY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.89, while CMG has a forward P/E of 56.61. We also note that CMPGY has a PEG ratio of 1.94. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CMG currently has a PEG ratio of 2.49.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for CMPGY is its P/B ratio of 7.71. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CMG has a P/B of 25.58.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help CMPGY earn a Value grade of B, while CMG has been given a Value grade of F.\n\nCMPGY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that CMPGY is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this Mexican food chain have returned -1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which Chipotle belongs, has lost 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Chipotle is expected to post earnings of $15.58 per share, indicating a change of +23.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $55.30 points to a change of +23.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $66.52 indicates a change of +20.3% from what Chipotle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Chipotle is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMG _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Chipotle, the consensus sales estimate of $2.92 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.3%. The $11.35 billion and $12.84 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15% and +13.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nChipotle reported revenues of $2.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.1%. EPS of $13.37 for the same period compares with $10.50 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.01%. The EPS surprise was +14.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nChipotle is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Chipotle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 High-Flying Stocks Have Split in 2024 -- But This Is the Only Stock-Split Stock Worth Buying Right Now",
        "content": "During periods of heightened volatility and uncertainty, it's not uncommon for professional and retail investors to gravitate to time-tested businesses that have handily outperformed Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500, over the long run. It's why the collective FAANG stocks have been so popular over the last decade.\n\nBut when the going has gotten tough on Wall Street over the past three years, it's stocks enacting splits that investors have flocked to. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMore than a half-dozen top-notch businesses became stock-split stocks in 2024\n\nTo keep things simple, a \"stock split\" is an event whereby a publicly traded company alters both its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. It's a purely superficial move that has no impact on a company's market cap or underlying operations.\n\nStock splits come in two forms: forward and reverse. A forward-stock split's purpose is to make shares more affordable for retail investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their online broker. By comparison, a reverse-stock split increases a company's share price, often with the goal of meeting minimum continued listing standards for a major U.S. stock exchange.\n\nSince 2024 began, seven high-flying stocks have announced or completed a forward-stock split:\n\nRetail kingpin Walmart(NYSE: WMT)announced a 3-for-1 stock split on January 30, and completed its first split in 25 years after the market closed on February 23. The board of fast-casual dining chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) approved a 50-for-1 split on March 19, which will take effect after the closing bell on June 25. Corporate identity uniforms company Cintas(NASDAQ: CTAS) gave the green light for a 4-for-1 stock split on May 2. Shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis after the market close on September 11. On May 14, the board of Japan-based consumer electronics company Sony Group(NYSE: SONY) Ok'd a 5-for-1 stock split, which goes into effect on October 8 for the company's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Electronic components juggernaut Amphenol(NYSE: APH) had its board approve a 2-for-1 forward split on May 20, which was completed on June 11. On May 21, wafer fabrication equipment company Lam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX) approved a 10-for-1 stock split, which will become effective after closing bell on October 2. Artificial intelligence (AI) behemoth Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a 10-for-1 forward-stock split on May 22, which was enacted after the market closed on June 7.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile all seven of these companies have well-defined competitive advantages and have seen their respective valuations soar over the years, only one of these stock-split stocks looks investment-worthy right now.\n\nThese half-dozen stock-split stocks are all historically pricey and/or set to face headwinds\n\nYou might be thinking that the infrastructure backbone of the AI revolution, Nvidia, is the logical stock to the buy of this stock-split group -- but this couldn't be further from my thinking. History has shown that every next-big-thing innovation since the mid-1990s has endured a bubble-popping event. Since no Ai stock has benefited more directly from the rise of AI, it's Nvidia that would be hit the hardest if history rhymes, once more.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia is set to face an onslaught of internal and external competition. Most notably, its four top customers, representing about 40% of its net sales, are internally developing AI-inspired graphics processing units of their own.\n\nThis also means that Lam Research, which is benefiting in a big way from the packaging of high-bandwidth memory needed in AI-accelerated data centers, isn't worth buying, either. Semiconductor equipment companies tend to be highly cyclical, and Lam Research is trading at one of its most-aggressive forward earnings multiples in a long time. Add in export restrictions of its AI-driven wafer fabrication equipment to China, and you have a stock with more potential risk than reward.\n\nIt's a similar story for Amphenol, which is valued well-above its average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple over the trailing-five-year period. Despite having competitive cost advantages, Amphenol is decidedly cyclical and at the mercy of the U.S. and global economy. A marked decline of close to 4% in U.S. M2 money supply since April 2022 may spell trouble for cyclical tech stocks trading at a premium.\n\nBut it's not just stock-split stocks in the tech sector whose valuations or growth trajectories are unappealing.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is valued at 47 times forward-year earnings. Although the introduction of digital ordering lanes (known as \"Chipotlanes\") and its limited menu have fueled operating efficiency at its restaurants, Chipotle is ultimately a food company whose organic growth rate is only in the high-single-digits.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart is commanding a forward earnings multiple of 25 with projected sales growth that's slated to come in just above the prevailing inflation rate. Though I can acknowledge that Walmart's size affords it cost advantages that few other retailers can match, there's minimal upside potential at a forward P/E of 25.\n\nTo round things out, corporate identity uniform provider Cintas is also aggressively valued. Even with the understanding that stock-split stocks have historically outperformed, paying a multiple of 41 times forward earnings for a cyclical business with low-double-digit forecast earnings growth through 2028 doesn't seem like a smart move for investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis is the only stock-split stock that can be confidently bought hand over fist right now\n\nAmong the \"Class of 2024\" stock-split stocks, the only one that looks like a screaming bargain right now is Japan-based Sony Group.\n\nI'll freely admit that Sony Group, like the six other stock-split stocks listed above, isn't perfect. New gaming consoles only come out every six to seven years, and sales of the PlayStation 5 have notably tapered since its introduction in November 2020. But in spite of this headwind, Sony has a multitude of catalysts, including gaming, which are capable of pushing its stock higher.\n\nFor instance, even though PlayStation 5 console sales have been unimpressive, Sony has enjoyed a steady improvement in PlayStation Plus subscription revenue. PlayStation Plus is a multi-tiered service that allows subscribers to game with their friends, as well as store their gaming data in the cloud. Subscription revenue tends to be predictable and often generates juicy margins.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Sony's next-generation gaming console may be less than three years away from hitting store shelves. It's not uncommon for the valuations of gaming companies to modestly expand in anticipation of a new console making its debut.\n\nBeyond gaming, Sony is a top-tier supplier of image sensors used in smartphones. Although smartphone sales aren't growing at the same pace they were a decade ago, wireless providers upgrading their networks to support 5G download speeds have incented consumers and businesses to upgrade their devices. Even a modest global expansion in smartphone sales should be enough to deliver meaningful operating growth for Sony's Imaging and Sensing Solutions segment.\n\nIn addition to approving a stock split, Sony's board also gave the green light to repurchase up to 30 million shares of the company's stock, on a post-split basis. If this buyback program were completed in its entirety, it would reduce the company's outstanding share count by almost 2.5%. More than likely, these buybacks will provide a modest boost to Sony's earnings per share.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that Sony Group is the only truly inexpensive stock-split stock of 2024.

        "content": "Buying and holding an index can eventually double your money, but its smarter to look for stocks predicted to double. That\u2019s because you can grow your money faster with the right investments. Some stocks double within a few years, while others do it in a few months.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to pinpoint stocks that will double within a few months. Shorter timeframes require a good mix of financial results, timing, and luck. However, luck becomes less relevant if you expand the time horizon.\n\nInvestors will have an easier time finding stocks that double if they set the deadline to 2026 instead of the end of 2024. Corporations then have more time to capitalize on growth initiatives, report stronger financials, and gain market share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinding stocks in high-growth industries with rising revenue and profit margins is a good recipe for success. These are some of the top growth stocks predicted to double by the end of 2026.\n\nCommVault Systems (CVLT) An image of a circle web with a lock icon in the center. AI stocks\n\nSource: vs148 / Shutterstock\n\nCommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) is a cloud security company offering a centralized platform. This model makes it easier for businesses to detect and address threats before they become serious.\n\nRevenue continues to rise for the cybersecurity firm. Q4 FY24 sales grew by 10% year-over-year to reach $223.3 million, while subscription revenue was up even more. That segment jumped by 27% YOY to reach $119.9 million.\n\nCommVault Systems initiated a $50.4 million stock buyback in the quarter. A one-time $103 million windfall from an income tax benefit gave the company extra cash to put back into its stock. CommVault Systems reported $23.1 million in income, excluding the income tax benefit.\n\nGrowth should continue for the firm. Guidance for the next quarter implies 8.3% year-over-year revenue growth at the midpoint. CommVault Systems also has $770 million in total annual recurring revenue, which is up by 16% year-over-year. That\u2019s not the only thing going up for CommVault Systems. Shares are up by 48% year-to-date and have gained 140% over the past five years.\n\nSezzle (SEZL) Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMocca\n\nSezzle (NASDAQ:SEZL) is a fintech firm that specializes in \u201cBuy Now, Pay Later\u201d solutions. The stock has silently crushed the stock market with a 306% year-to-date gain. Despite the incredible rally, the stock only trades at a 38 P/E ratio.\n\nRevenue, denoted as \u201cTotal Income\u201d in the Q1 2024 press release, increased by 35.5% year-over-year. Net income jumped by 364.3% YOY, resulting in a 17.0% net profit margin. The company\u2019s Q1 FY24 GAAP net income exceeded all of its fiscal 2023 GAAP profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nSezzle has $82.2 million of cash on hand and a market cap of roughly $500 million. The firm bumped its guidance to suggest 25% YOY revenue growth and $30 million in GAAP net income in fiscal 2024. Sezzle has a solid balance sheet with more than twice as many current assets as current liabilities.\n\nSezzle plans to generate $5 EPS in fiscal 2024. Current levels indicate the stock has a forward P/E ratio under 18 times.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany fast-food restaurant stocks have been soaring. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) set the standard of how quickly a fast-food restaurant chain can grow. It\u2019s easy to see Chipotle\u2019s 5-year gain of 351% and wonder if you can find the next hot restaurant stock.\n\nGranted, many investors have had this same idea. Money has poured into fast-food restaurant stocks, inflating their P/E ratios and making them far riskier than they were a few months ago.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) is an exception to the rule that offers \u201cgrowth at a reasonable price.\u201d The stock trades at a 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.45% yield. Shares are up 41% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nThe steakhouse restaurant chain reported another quarter with rising revenue and profit margins. Sales increased by 12.5% YOY in the first quarter, while net income was up by 31% YOY. Comparable restaurant sales flourished and were up by 8.4% year-over-year. Rising profit margins, more restaurant openings, and a reasonable valuation make the stock a good candidate for a doubling by the end of 2026.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CVLT and TXRH.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in June and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "Stock splits often create excitement and buzz among investors, but not all splits are alike. Some stock splits point to fantastic long-term growth stories and great investment opportunities, while others may be overvalued speculation stories that ultimately lead to disappointments.\n\nOn that note, the June 2024 stock split calendar includes two household names, and I recommend buying one but not the other right now.\n\nThe stock to buy: Chipotle\n\nMexican fast-food giant Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) is set to undergo a 50-for-1 stock split, effective June 26, 2024. While the split will drop individual share prices from the $3,155 range to approximately $63, the true appeal lies in the company's robust fundamentals and growth prospects.\n\nAlthough Chipotle is not cheap by conventional profitability metrics -- boasting a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 68 and a price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) ratio of 66 -- its revenue-based price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.6x is more palatable. This is particularly notable given the robust profit margins the company enjoys in the competitive restaurant industry.\n\nOne key factor that sets Chipotle apart is its strategy of direct ownership of its restaurants. It's an unusual approach in today's food service industry, where most brands prefer to manage a number of franchisee locations.\n\nChipotle's more hands-on approach not only supports product quality but also fosters better employee relations, leading to higher service standards and customer satisfaction. This commitment to quality and operational efficiency drives Chipotle's strong financial performance and market position.\n\nThe company's ability to innovate with menu offerings, such as the successful introduction of lifestyle bowls and plant-based options, continues to attract a diverse customer base. Moreover, Chipotle's robust digital strategy, which includes a popular app and efficient delivery services, has significantly boosted sales and customer loyalty. With a well-defined expansion plan and an unwavering focus on sustainability, Chipotle is well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\nIt's important to note that stock splits themselves don't inherently add value to any stock; they simply make high-priced stocks more affordable to a broader range of investors. The approval of a split can be seen as a vote of confidence in future stock gains by the board of directors, but it's largely accounting gymnastics. Nonetheless, Chipotle looks like a buy right now for the reasons above, making the upcoming stock split an opportune moment for investors to enter or expand their position in this high-performing stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock to avoid: Nvidia\n\nOn the flip side, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) performed a 10-for-1 stock split over the weekend, effective on the morning of June 10. While Nvidia is a leader in the generative AI boom and has a stellar track record, the stock's lofty valuation is cause for concern.\n\nNvidia's stock trades at an extremely high 70x earnings, 37x sales, and 75x free cash flow. These multiples suggest that much of the company's future growth potential is already priced in, leaving little room for error.\n\nIn comparison, Chipotle's valuation ratios -- while also high -- are less concerning. The profit-based figures are comparable to Chipotle's, but the Mexican restaurants manager's price-to-sales ratio of 8.6x is considerably lower than Nvidia's 37x. Profits come and go much faster than top-line revenues, and can be manipulated with cost controls and accounting tricks.\n\nFor example, about 31% of Nvidia's annual operating expenses are recorded in the form of stock-based compensation right now -- and that ratio is rising. Chipotle also boosts its bottom-line profits with stock-based compensation, but that's just 14% of the company's operating costs. Nvidia is more vulnerable to stock price fluctuations, adding uncertainty to an already highly competitive market space.\n\nImagine a rival like Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) undermining Nvidia's dominant AI systems position with power-efficient and price-competitive AI accelerator chips. The sudden presence of a strong challenger could drive down Nvidia's lofty stock valuation, perhaps inspiring top engineering talent to find work elsewhere, and undermining Nvidia's long-term prospects.\n\nI have sold some of my Nvidia shares recently, reinvesting the profits in another high-growth stock with a lower valuation. By diversifying my portfolio, I'm balancing the potential growth opportunities while managing risk in an unpredictable market. With or without stock splits, Nvidia certainly looks risky at today's prices.\n\nWhy Chipotle is the better stock-split buy in June\n\nNvidia's steep valuation and high stock-based compensation expenses pose significant risks in a competitive tech landscape. At the same time, Chipotle's robust profit margins and strategic growth initiatives make it a solid investment idea right now.\n\nI'll agree that Nvidia's stock split also serves the same vote-of-confidence function as Chipotle's, but the restaurant chain's statement looks stronger. So if you're looking for a stock-split stock to buy today, I'd recommend taking a closer look at Chipotle while staying away from Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks Over $100 You Should Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "The $100 per share price point is a magical threshold for many investors and companies. Stocks priced below that amount are considered affordable while those above it are \u201cexpensive.\u201d It is why when many companies announce a stock split the ratio applied is typically sufficient to get the shares below $100.\n\nFor example, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) trades at over $3,100 per share. Its shareholders just approved a 50-to-1 stock split, one of the largest splits in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. When completed, CMG stock will trade for around $63 a share.\n\nChipotle could have split its stock 2-to-1, 3-to-1 or even 10-to-1 but it wouldn\u2019t have been enough. Even at 20-to-1, Chipotle stock would still trade for more than $150 a stub. It is a psychological barrier that companies feel the need to break through. Yet whether Chipotle Mexican Grill costs $3,100 or $63, it is still a great stock to own. It is not the price that matters but the business underlying that is important.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMaybe you can\u2019t afford a stock costing thousands of dollars and don\u2019t have access to a brokerage that will let you buy fractional shares. That\u2019s okay. There are still plenty of stocks over $100 to buy that will make great investments without breaking the bank.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nOff-price retailer TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is a great place to start your hunt for excellent stocks over $100 to buy. The owner of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and more, has a long history of market outperformance, even during a recession. Perhaps especially during recessions.\n\nHelping consumers get great deals on name brand products has been the hallmark of TJX business. Through all types of business and economic cycles, the retailer has maintained a steady upward trajectory. Since its 1989 initial public offering, TJX gave investors a total return of 30,610% versus just 3,000% for the S&P 500. The change in stock price alone generated 18,000% returns for investors.\n\nTJX Companies stock goes for around $107 per share and though its valuation is slightly elevated compared to historical norms, it remains one of the stocks over $100 to buy. The retailer continues to see rising sales, profits and margins. As the economy becomes more difficult, consumers looking for a bargain while trying to look good will return again and again to its retail banners.\n\nRTX (RTX) A booth showcasing various technologies offered by Raytheon.\n\nSource: Jordan Tan / Shutterstock.com\n\nRTX (NYSE:RTX) is the second-largest defense contractor producing much of the U.S. military\u2019s missile defense systems. Among its many platforms, RTX is responsible for the Patriot missile system, Stinger and Javelin missiles, high-speed, anti-radiation missiles (HARMS) and national surface-to-air missile systems (NASAMS).\n\nStory continues\n\nLike death and taxes, the reality is that war will always be with us. Yet as President Theodore Roosevelt once said, \u201cspeak softly and carry a big stick.\u201d RTX is a big part of the U.S. military\u2019s \u201cbig stick.\u201d Preparedness ensures wars needn\u2019t be fought on U.S. soil.\n\nThe defense contractor generated $19.2 billion in Q1 sales, a 12% increase. GAAP profits soared 32% to $1.32 per share. Adjusted earnings rose 10% to $1.34 per share. The future looks just as strong. RTX President and COO Chris Calio said, \u201cWe\u2019re operating in one of the strongest demand periods in our history with a record $202 billion backlog.\u201d\n\nThe war in Ukraine certainly fuels a lot of the demand for RTX weapons systems. During the quarter it booked $282 million for NASAMS for Ukraine. But the military contractor also booked $1.6 billion for Patriot systems for Germany, $818 million for Patriot-guided enhance missiles (GEM-T) for NATO and another $874 million for various international GEM-T orders.\n\nI\u2019ve long expected RTX stock to hit an inflection point because of all the global hot spots that erupted over the last four years. Shares have more than doubled in that time frame, and trade at $108 today. Yet RTX stock is up over 50% since just last October. War is big business and RTX is one of the biggest to benefit from it.\n\nAxcelis Technologies (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe third stock over $100 to buy is Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS), a manufacturer of ion implantation systems that are critical to the chip-making process. As the complexity of computer chips has grown, the number of implant steps increased with it. Implantation is a form of introducing impurities into a semiconductor to its electrical, optical and structural properties.\n\nAxcelis is the second-largest provider of implantation systems behind Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and has a 28% share of the market. It is the only company offering a broad range of equipment for the process. It is the fastest-growing one in the field.\n\nWhere Axcelis Technologies stock had been trading at $111 per share recently, Bank of America upgraded its price target to $125 and the stock immediately took off to meet the new target. The consensus view on Wall Street has a one-year price target of $146 per share, implying an additional 16% upside in the stock.\n\nPresident and CEO Russell Low said Axcelis was \u201coff to a good start in 2024\u201d after posting first-quarter results as the tech stock\u2019s products \u201ccontinue to win business from new customers globally.\u201d It makes the tech equipment leader an excellent stock over $100 to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in RTX stock.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Billionaire-Owned Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Investors love to follow Warren Buffett's stock picks to get investing inspiration. But while Buffett is an investing legend who freely gives sound advice, he's not the only billionaire investor.\n\nOthers might be lesser known, but they have also been responsible for incredible wealth creation, and you might want to get to know them and their stock picks better. Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG), Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST), and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are three fantastic billionaire-owned stock that average retail investors might want to add to their portfolios right now.\n\n1. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle is the original fast-casual restaurant chain, and it has become a powerhouse company and incredible stock. It still has tons of potential in feeding burritos to its upscale clientele, and it's a favorite of Pershing Square Capital's Bill Ackman. It has been a mainstay of Pershing Square for years, making up 20% of the total portfolio, which has only seven different stocks.\n\nChipotle has 3,500 restaurants, and it sees the opportunity to reach 7,000 company-owned restaurants in North America alone. It has expanded internationally as well and is just getting started in global locations. It signed its first franchise agreement for restaurants in the Middle East and has already opened its first one in Kuwait.\n\nThe company sees many opportunities to grow comparable-restaurant sales as well. It continues to improve its processes and release new menu items, resulting in efficiencies and higher consumer interest. Management was able to successfully raise prices to combat inflation, and its performance has been outstanding despite the challenging economy.\n\nThe company announced a 50-for-1 stock split in March to go through at the end of June, and that's just another reason to be confident about this reliable, no-brainer stock.\n\n2. Costco\n\nCostco is also a no-brainer stock for reliable growth. It operates a membership model that breeds loyalty and sales growth, and it's resilient under pressure. That's why the chain continues to report strong growth in both revenue and comparable-store sales despite inflation.\n\nThe company began to feel some pressure last year from a combination of trying to build on unprecedented growth during the height of the pandemic and customers holding back on expensive purchases. Now it's back to accelerating growth that's still outdoing pre-pandemic rates. Sales increased 9.1% in the 2024 third fiscal quarter (ended May 12) driven by a 6.6% increase in comps.\n\nThe membership fees go straight to the bottom line, and with an increase in those fees and high renewal rates, Costco has been reporting high profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company still has plenty of opportunity to open new stores, too, and plans to add about 25 to 30 stores annually, which is a low rate for retail chains. Each one of Costco's huge warehouses is another incredible growth driver, and this well of new sales won't dry up anytime soon.\n\nBillionaires like Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments and Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors own Costco stock. It's been reliable for decades, and there is every reason to believe that it can continue to deliver long-term gains.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nLastly, many billionaires own shares of the final stock I'll recommend today, Amazon, starting with Warren Buffett. He only bought shares for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio in 2019, while other billionaires have owned it for much longer.\n\nAmazon is the second-largest company in the U.S. by sales and still has a multitude of growth opportunities.

        "title": "7 Cash-Cow Stocks Making Money Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Cash-cow stocks represent a distinctive category in the stock market that retail investors tend to underappreciate. But what are cash-cow stocks?\n\nAs the name suggests, cash-cow stocks generate substantial, predictable and recurring free cash flow per share. This metric is generally more telling than earnings per share because it provides a clearer picture of the actual cash available for quick deployment, omitting non-cash factors such as depreciation. Free cash flow\u2019s consistency and reliability help investors forecast profits more accurately, creating improved pricing accuracy and long-term modeling.\n\nCurrent interest rates and sky-high mega-cap valuations make cash flow more important than ever and cash-cow stocks more appealing as a result. That\u2019s why cash-cow ETFs like the Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF (BATS:COWZ) have enjoyed record inflows in recent months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf you want to create a custom basket of cash-cow stocks, though, starting with these seven companies creates a well-rounded, financially robust cash-cow portfolio of your own.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe king of cash-cow stocks, Warren Buffett, loves Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) \u2014 and for good reason. Offering a 3% total yield and $4.9 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, few cash-cow stocks blend growth and income as effectively as Occidental Petroleum.\n\nOver recent years, particularly in 2023, Buffett\u2019s Occidental Petroleum holdings exploded in size. He now holds 27% of the oil and gas giant, valued at over $14.5 billion. He also possesses warrants that could boost his ownership to 33%. While Occidental is actively engaged in sustainability and net-zero initiatives, it also stands to gain from the rising crude oil prices currently observed in the market.\n\nRecently, Occidental\u2019s stock price has oscillated between $55 and $65, though it briefly touched $70 per share in April before settling back toward its usual trading range. But, thanks to both its intrinsic strengths and rising crude prices, the company\u2019s shares may be ready to mark new highs. Now may be the best time to follow Buffett and buy this cash-cow stock with growth prospects situated within a well-established sector.\n\nZoom Video Communications (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nRemote work isn\u2019t going anywhere, and surprising cash-cow stock Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) is perfectly poised to capitalize on this trend. Offering $4.33 in free cash flow per share and plenty of continued growth prospects, Zoom\u2019s expanding toolkit may represent a new momentum surge for the cash-cow stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nZoom has been integrating generative AI to enhance user experiences, unveiling a host of features last year. These include an AI assistant that integrates across Zoom\u2019s platforms, encompassing meetings, chats, phone, email and whiteboard functionalities. More interesting, Zoom\u2019s CEO is also moving toward creating \u201cdigital twins\u201d with AI to improve personal productivity and further entrench the cash-cow stock as the main player in remote work tech.\n\nTo that end, Zoom is broadening its services to become a comprehensive solution for remote workers. Initially focused solely on video conferencing, Zoom is now developing a more integrated ecosystem. This evolution simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need for multiple applications, which reduces friction for remote workers and employers alike. Additionally, this approach enhances customer retention, as both large corporations and small businesses increasingly rely on Zoom as their primary provider for remote communication solutions.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) exemplifies a top cash-cow stock, as evidenced by its staggeringly high share price and imminent 50-for-1 stock split. This valuation is underpinned by the company\u2019s robust free cash flow per share, which has averaged $13.91 across the past five quarters. Better yet, the company bounced back from a small dip of $3.41 free cash flow per share in 2023\u2019s fourth quarter to hit a whopping $15.91 per share to start 2024.\n\nWith over 90% of its shares held by institutional investors, Chipotle is a favored stock among big financial entities. One notable investor, Bill Ackman, holds a 3% stake, benefiting significantly from Chipotle\u2019s aggressive share buyback programs. Over the past five years, these buybacks have been a consistent feature, except during a brief hiatus during the pandemic. The company recently announced plans to continue this trend with an additional $200 million repurchase round, signaling ongoing confidence in its financial strategy and future growth prospects.\n\nRestaurants tend to be a risky prospect (just ask Red Lobster), but Chipotle\u2019s cash-cow status and institutional ownership both affirm its long-term potential.\n\nHanesbrands (HBI) HanesBrands (HBI) logo displayed on a smartphone with red Hanes underwear brand logo displayed in image background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/viewimage\n\nHanesbrands (NYSE:HBI), a leading innerwear clothing seller, dominates 60% of the market across several countries. Despite this, the stock trades shockingly low, slightly above $5, equating to a mere 0.34x price-to-sales ratio even as the stock posted $503 million in free cash flow over the past 12 months.\n\nThe company has faced significant challenges, including supply chain issues and faltering consumer confidence, prompting management to streamline operations strategically. Recently, Hanes initiated steps to divest its Champion clothing line, focusing more on its core innerwear products. The deal is worth $1.2 billion but may climb to $1.5 billion if performance criteria are met, further increasing the cash-cow stock\u2019s treasure chest.\n\nLast year,Barington Capital Group, an activist investment firm, publicly urged Hanes to implement cost reductions, reduce inventory and improve margins. The proposed sale of Champion may be a direct response to Barington\u2019s demands, signaling the beginning of a recovery phase for this undervalued cash-cow stock.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), recognized for its array of travel services, including Priceline and Kayak, stands out as another cash-cow stock with a high share price exceeding $3,800. Despite a recent dip, Booking\u2019s free cash flow per share is a massive $191.60 over the past 12 months. Institutional ownership is substantial, with more than 92% of the company held by institutions, contributing significantly to the firm\u2019s 8.25% total yield, of which only 0.46% comes from dividends.\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about Booking Holdings\u2019 future growth as the global travel industry rebounds from pandemic-induced lows. This optimism is supported by the company\u2019s latest earnings report, which showed a 10% year-over-year increase in quarterly gross travel bookings and a 17% surge in sales. Moreover, annual income jumped by 192%, indicating that management is effectively navigating higher interest rates and tightening cost controls to enhance profit margins \u2014 both buoyed by an improving travel market that will likely explode as the summer progresses.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) operates at the cutting edge of technology, specializing in the development of semiconductor photomasks \u2014 a critical component in semiconductor manufacturing. This focus positions Photronics at a pivotal junction between today\u2019s essential tech and tomorrow\u2019s limitless possibilities. Better yet, the small-cap tech stock is also a cash cow, generating $173.5 million in free cash flow over the past year.\n\nPhotomask technology, while complex, has a dual impact on technological progress. It ensures the precision and accuracy vital for advancing sectors like artificial intelligence and quantum computing, where increasingly intricate circuit designs demand flawless execution. Furthermore, Photomasks play a crucial role in miniaturizing transistors and other components, thereby driving advancements in line with Moore\u2019s Law.\n\nTrading at a modest 12.5x earnings, Photronics offers an attractive entry point for investors. This valuation is considered low for a tech stock, especially one that enables key technological advancements. With its stable and solid free cash flow, as well as its critical role in the semiconductor industry, Photronics represents a promising opportunity for growth as global dependency on semiconductor technologies continues to expand.\n\nAutoZone (AZO) An AutoZone (AZO) storefront in Saint Augustine, Florida.\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutoZone (NYSE:AZO) enjoys a strong following among auto enthusiasts and has captured the attention of institutional investors, with a remarkable 93% ownership rate and a share price hovering a bit below $3,000. As a prime example of a cash-cow stock, AutoZone has demonstrated stable financial performance, boasting an average free cash flow per share of $112.30 over the last 12 months.\n\nThe company recently reported strong third-quarter results, though somewhat muted compared to its record-setting second quarter. Still, AutoZone\u2019s financials exceeded previous figures and market expectations, with earnings per share surging to $36.69 \u2014 a 7.5% increase year-over-year. Both revenue and profit margins expanded despite facing challenging holiday sales comparisons for both Christmas and New Year\u2019s.\n\nFurthermore, AutoZone has expanded its retail footprint, adding 45 new stores, bringing its total to 7,236 locations. Although these new stores initially impacted cash flow, they are poised to contribute positively soon, enhancing AutoZone\u2019s robust free cash flow per share as they integrate into the company\u2019s efficient operational model.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nHow Fast Is Chipotle Mexican Grill Growing?\n\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Chipotle Mexican Grill's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 48%. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Chipotle Mexican Grill achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 14% to US$10b. That's encouraging news for the company!\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this freereport showing analyst forecasts for Chipotle Mexican Grill's future profits.\n\nAre Chipotle Mexican Grill Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Chipotle Mexican Grill has a market capitalisation of US$87b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$572m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.7% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Add Chipotle Mexican Grill To Your Watchlist?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, Chipotle Mexican Grill is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill that you need to be mindful of.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Chipotle Is Splitting Its Stock 50-for-1 This Month: Should You Buy Now?",
        "content": "Investors love a good stock split. Those events don't do anything more than split the same-sized pie into smaller pieces, but they only occur after a company's share price has soared, which generally indicates that the business is doing quite well. Even better, when management decides to split a company's stock, it implies that it thinks there's more growth coming.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) wowed Wall Street back in March with the announcement of a stock split with one of the biggest multiples ever: Each current share will be split into 50 new shares. The change is set to go through on June 25 for shareholders of record as of June 18.\n\nSo is now the time to buy Chipotle?\n\nChipotle stock looks unstoppable\n\nChipotle has been an incredible stock to own over its time as a public company, and while it has had some rough patches, it has absolutely crushed the S&P 500 over the past five years as well as most other time periods. CMG Chart\n\nIt has created a fast-casual model that generates incredible customer loyalty, sales, and profits -- and that has been hard to replicate. It's known for selling healthy, fresh Mexican-style fare at midlevel prices; it's more expensive than the typical fast-food chain, but significantly cheaper than the standard sit-down restaurant. It targets a more affluent clientele that tends to be more resilient during periods of economic volatility, and it has demonstrated strong performance over the past few years despite a pandemic and the surge of inflation that followed it. It is also incredibly profitable, with high and increasing margins and net income.\n\nOther chains have attempted to mimic its model and performance, and many new contenders have been touted as \"the next Chipotle.\" But whatever its secret sauce is, it continues to stand out from its peers. As CEO Brian Niccol recently quipped: \"The next Chipotle is Chipotle.\"\n\nConsider its operating margins compared with those of Sweetgreen, Shake Shack, and CavaGroup. CMG Operating Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWhat's coming next?\n\nChipotle already has more than 3,000 restaurants, but it's aiming to eventually have 7,000 in North America alone. It's fairly saturated in large urban markets, so now it's going after the smaller towns and suburban areas where many of its affluent customers live. It's also intensifying its push into Canada.\n\nIt already has some stores in select European markets, so it has plenty of opportunity to expand internationally, and it recently launched its first franchise partnerships for stores in the Middle East. Otherwise, all of its locations are company owned.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement also sees a flywheel effect in its business that creates opportunities for leverage and efficiency. As it retains a strong cadre of employees and trains them in leadership roles, its stores perform better, with faster service and higher transaction rates.\n\nIs now the time to buy?\n\nSince investors love stock splits, Chipotle stock rose in the wake of the news that this one was coming. But Chipotle stock tends to rise all the time, and it headed even higher after its outstanding first-quarter earnings report.\n\nStock-split stocks do seem to rise after they split, lending support to the argument that investors should buy them beforehand. But nobody can reliably \"time the market,\" and there's no need to try. If you see the opportunity in buying Chipotle stock, it won't matter much in the long term whether you bought it before or after the split. What could matter is that the earlier you buy it, the longer you have for its growth to compound, maximizing your overall gains.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Ikea will pay humans $17 an hour to work virtual jobs in its video game store",
        "content": "As more and more Americans flock to the virtual world of Roblox, brands are trying all kinds of tricks to bring real-world retail experiences to the gaming platform.\n\nIn 2022, Chipotle released the Chipotle Burrito Builder, a simulation in which players roll virtual burritos for a chance to win credits at Chipotle stores. Kellogg and Forever 21 have tried their hand at similar stunts on the platform to help promote their products, and the platform even rolled out virtual video ads earlier this year.\n\nNow, Ikea is trying its hand in the Roblox metaverse as well\u2014with a twist. The furniture chain is hiring human workers to do everything from helping customers pick out furniture to serving meatballs at the Ikea bistro\u2014all online.\n\nEarlier this week, the Swedish company beloved for its affordable home furnishings announced that it was accepting applications for 10 paid positions at the Coworker Game, a new virtual universe the brand is launching on Roblox at the end of the month. While virtual visitors will be able to browse, Ikea told Fortune that the gameplay itself focuses specifically on work: Ikea fans and Roblox users will have the opportunity to experience the brand\u2019s workplace environment alongside a few paid employees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be the first brand to launch paid work on Roblox to showcase how we do careers differently,\u201d Darren Taylor, country, people, and culture manager at Ikea U.K. and Ireland, said in a press release.\n\nThe announcement comes as part of Ikea\u2019s effort to attract a new generation of workers, according to the press release. The company told Fortune that the brand is actively trying to promote greater work flexibility and give employees increased autonomy in determining their work patterns. For the 10 paid positions, pay will start at \u00a313.15\u2014just under $17 an hour\u2014and new virtual coworkers will have the opportunity to \u201cflex their skills, help customers, and get promoted to move departments, just like in the real world.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Ikea, there is no set route to career progression,\u201d Taylor said in the statement.\n\nThe paid opportunities are available only to Roblox users in the U.K. and Ireland, and working in the Roblox universe will not give users any advantage in applying for roles at Ikea in the material world, the company told Fortune.\n\nLaunched in 2006, Roblox has evolved into one of the most popular virtual experience platforms in the world, with more than 75 million daily users, a figure that\u2019s tripled since 2020. The platform functions as a virtual playground, enabling users to participate in a variety of user-generated games.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe platform\u2019s emphasis on buying and selling virtual items has also lent itself to partnerships with major brands looking to experiment in the metaverse\u2019s retail market. In 2021, Nike partnered with Roblox to release Nikeland, a virtual world allowing users to buy virtual products and dress their avatars in Nike apparel.\n\nRecently, however, the company has struggled as costs have continued to outpace revenues and its stock has fallen well below its 2021 high. In its most recent quarter, revenues fell almost $130 million short of expectations, as the video game industry at large continues to struggle post-pandemic, with the cost of game development going up and the return to work and school pulling users away from their consoles.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "After posting impressive Q1 results last week, Cava Group CAVA has started to display the expansion that pushed other popular retail restaurant chains to notoriety among investors such as Chipotle Mexican Grill\u00a0CMG and Starbucks SBUX.\n\nTo that point, since going public in June of 2023, the Mediterranean fast-casual food chain has seen its stock soar almost +100% which in this time frame has largely outperformed Starbucks -19% and the Zacks Retail-Restaurant Market\u2019s -6% while impressively topping the broader indexes and even edging Chipotle\u2019s +56%.\n\nConsidering Cava Group has been one the hottest IPOs in recent memory let\u2019s see if it's still time to buy CAVA for more upside. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ1 Review\n\nPosting Q1 sales of $259.01 million, Cava Group\u2019s top line expanded 46% over the last three months with Q4 sales at $177.17 million. This also beat Q1 sales estimates of $246.65 million by 5%. More intriguing is that Cava Group is already profitable with Q1 EPS of $0.12 crushing expectations of $0.04 per share by 200% while skyrocketing from $0.02 a share in Q4. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Trajectory & Overview\n\nAlthough Cava Group launched its IPO last year, the company was founded in 2006 and has locations across the United States. Fueling Cava Group\u2019s expansion is a unique dining experience with its build-your-own bowl model being similar to Chipotle as customers can customize their choice of high-quality fresh ingredients.\n\nCava Group\u2019s total sales are now expected to climb 24% in FY24 and are slated to jump another 20% in FY25 to just over $1 billion. Annual earnings are projected to soar 62% this year to $0.34 per share versus $0.21 a share in 2023. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to expand another 33% to $0.46. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMore intriguing and suggestive that the rally in CAVA could continue is that earnings estimate revisions for FY24 and FY25 are nicely up in the last 30 days and have now soared over 40% in the last two months respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nCava Group's stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as it would be no surprise if CAVA continued to move higher considering the company\u2019s attractive growth trajectory and the positive trend of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Growth stocks continue to drive the market and investor portfolios higher. Several companies with strong catalysts are seeing their sales and profits rise, and that is pushing their share prices to new heights. For investors, growth stocks can make a big difference to the performance of their portfolio and how much money they ultimately make off their investments.\n\nCurrently, the stock market is hovering near all-time highs largely because of some strong performing growth stocks. These are stocks that have outperformed the broader market by a wide margin. And the companies behind them continue to flourish and expand at a rapid rate. Owning even a few of these high-flying growth equities can make all the difference when it comes to achieving wealth.\n\nLet\u2019s explore growth stock goliaths \u2014 seven picks that will tower over the competition.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of audio streaming giant Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) continues to rip higher. So far this year, SPOT has gained 70%, bringing its 12 month increase to 105%.\n\nThe company has distinguished itself as the dominant player in the streaming of music, podcasts and audiobooks. And, Spotify is giving satellite radio a run for its money. The latest news to drive the share price higher is that Spotify is raising the prices it charges for its premium plans in the U.S. as it tries to expand profit margins.\n\nAdditionally, the Swedish company has raised prices for its monthly individual premium plan to $11.99 from $10.99. Spotify has also increased the price of its premium duo plan to $16.99 from $14.99 and hiked its family plan to $19.99 from $16.99 previously. The price increases are the latest attempt by SPOT to improve margins. The company had already lowered its spending and cut staff. Spotify\u2019s quarterly profit topped $1 billion for the first time this April after the company curtailed its global marketing spend.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nCan anything stop Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF)?\n\nRecently, the clothing retailer\u2019s stock jumped 24% higher after it reported record Q1 financial results. The company reported EPS of $2.14 versus $1.74 that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $1.02 billion compared to $963.3 million that was forecast on Wall Street. Sales were up 22% from last year and profits were nearly seven times higher than Q1 of 2023.\n\nFurther, Abercrombie & Fitch said the results represented the strongest first quarter in its 132-year history. The company has been one of the best-performing retailers coming out of the pandemic. Specifically, it reported double-digit sales growth throughout 2023. Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s financial results have improved over the past six years when the company began to transform into a brand geared toward working millennials.\n\nStory continues\n\nANF stock has risen 440% in the past 12 months, including a 90% gain this year.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock market is near an all-time high. Trading in cryptocurrencies has come storming back. And, even the trade in meme stocks is back on.\n\nIs it any wonder that the stock of online brokerage Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) has more than doubled in the last 12 months (up 135%)? Shortly after reporting record Q1 financial results, HOOD announced its first ever stock buyback, sending its share price even higher.\n\nThe brokerage says it plans to repurchase $1 billion of its own shares over the next three years. Analysts at Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) have calculated that Robinhood Markets is likely to buyback 49 million shares of its common stock, or 6% of its total shares outstanding. The share repurchases are scheduled to begin in this year\u2019s third quarter. Robinhood Markets hasn\u2019t set an expiration date for its inaugural stock buyback program.\n\nTherefore, some analysts say the stock buyback is a sign that Robinhood is maturing. Also, the company has announced an expansion into credit cards. So far in 2024, HOOD stock is up 70%.\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nMediterranean restaurant chain Cava Group (NYSE:CAVA) went public a year ago. Since then, it has delivered four consecutive quarters of profits. The company, which many analysts refer to as the next Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), recently reported first-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates across the board and raised its forward guidance.\n\nThe company reported EPS of 13 cents, which was nearly triple the 5 cents expected among analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $259 million, ahead of Wall Street expectations for $246 million. Sales were up 30% from a year ago. Cava continues to expand at breakneck speed, opening 14 new restaurants during Q1 of this year. That brought its national count to 323 outlets. And analysts say there\u2019s plenty more growth ahead.\n\nThe stock of Cava has more than doubled (up 133%) since its market debut in June 2023.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) Person holding mobile phone with logo of British semiconductor company Arm Ltd. on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRene Haas, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of British microchip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), recently said that his goal is to capture 50% of the market for personal computer (PC) chips within five years. That\u2019s ambitious and speaks to Arm\u2019s ascent as a leading growth stock. Since holding its initial public offering (IPO) in September 2023, ARM stock has also more than doubled, having gained 108%.\n\nThe company has only reported a couple of quarterly earnings so far, but the results have been encouraging. Recently, Arm revealed that its fiscal Q4 revenue rose 47% year-over-year (YOY) to $928 million. The sales growth was driven by Arm\u2019s licensing unit, which grew 60% to $414 million during the quarter. The company said demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips is powering its overall sales growth.\n\nArm\u2019s microchips and processors are already used in many different electronic devices, including most smartphones. The PC market looks to be the company\u2019s next target.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA stock) logo on white object in foreground as well as a high-rise building in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTalk about a comeback.\n\nAfter being decimated during the 2022 bear market, shares of Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) have come roaring back. The stock recently rose more than 30% after the online used car retailer reported record quarterly financial results and turned a profit during this year\u2019s first quarter. Year-to-date (YTD), Carvana\u2019s stock is up 104%. Over the past 12 months, the stock has risen an incredible 565%.\n\nFor Q1 of this year, the company announced EPS of 23 cents compared to a loss of 74 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $3.06 billion versus $2.67 billion that was anticipated on Wall Street. The financial results are records for Carvana, which has been in business since 2012. The strong print was attributed to efficiency gains in its operations and the reconditioning of vehicles for sale.\n\nManagement said they\u2019re planning further cost reductions and efficiency gains that will increase profitability further through areas such as advertising, overhead, and operational expenses. Carvana\u2019s success comes after a major restructuring, with the company pivoting to focus on profitability rather than growth after bankruptcy concerns emerged in 2022.\n\nEli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) has a blockbuster catalyst with its hugely popular weight loss drug Zepbound. The medication used to treat obesity was only approved for sale in the U.S. six months ago.\n\nBut already, it is having a positive impact on LLY\u2019s finances. Recently, the pharmaceutical company reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit and raised its forward guidance as sales of its weight-loss drugs rapidly accelerate.\n\nEli Lilly and Co. reported Q1 EPS of $2.58 versus $2.46 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter missed analyst targets, coming in at $8.77 billion compared to $8.92 billion that was forecast. Despite the miss, sales were up 26% YOY. As for guidance, Eli Lilly and Co. said it expects full-year earnings of $13.50 to $14 per share, up from previous guidance of $12.20 to $12.70 a share. The company expects full-year revenue of $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion, which is an increase of $2 billion at either end of the range.\n\nAnalysts had expected full-year earnings of $12.50 a share and sales of $41.44 billion from Eli Lilly and Co. The latest earnings include the first full quarter of Zepbound sales. The drug, which was approved by U.S. regulators last autumn, reported $517.4 million in Q1 sales. Some analysts have forecast that Zepbound could post more than $1 billion of sales in its first year on the market. Therefore, it might become the biggest selling drug of all time.\n\nLLY stock has risen 87% over the last 12 months, including a YTD gain of 40%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in LLY and CAVA.

Two other women climbed onto the employee side of the service counter and also began throwing food at the shocked staff.\n\nBemused customers can be seen scattered around the store as they watch the chaos.\n\nDetails of what led to the outburst are unknown, and it is unclear whether police became involved in the altercation.

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) is one of the most recognized restaurant chains in the world. Its relentless focus on food quality and top-notch customer service has helped it build one of the most loyal followings among fast-food businesses.\n\nWith sizzling carne asada, tasty burritos, and fresh avocado, it's hard not to enjoy a meal at Chipotle. However, the company has something new brewing, and it has nothing to do with food.\n\nChipotle's board of directors recently approved a 50-for-1 stock split. Assuming that the company's shareholders add their approval on June 6, split-adjusted shares will hit the exchanges later this month.\n\nLet's dive into the mechanics of stock splits, and assess if Chipotle stock is a buy right now.\n\nWhy is Chipotle splitting its stock?\n\nAt of the time of this writing, shares of Chipotle are trading for approximately $3,063. Its all-time high stock price was about $3,200.\n\nBroadly speaking, when a stock begins to hover around record levels, buying activity can sometimes slow down. This is because investors perceive the stock as expensive and begin looking for alternatives.\n\nThis behavior is based more in psychology than on the investing fundamentals, though. When a company undergoes a stock split, the number of outstanding shares rises by the stated ratio. At the same time, the share price is reduced by that same ratio -- therefore, the market cap and valuations of the company remain unchanged.\n\nNevertheless, Chipotle's management believes that splitting its stock will make it more accessible and appealing to employees and retail investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nChipotle is a best-in-breed business\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if you have some trepidation when it comes to investing in a restaurant stock. Macroeconomic factors such as inflation and higher interest rates have taken a toll on consumer discretionary spending. As such, a business that depends on people's willingness to pay for small indulgences like take-out meals may not come across as the most enticing investment opportunity.\n\nChipotle has differentiated itself from some of its peers through investments in technology. The company makes venture capital-style investments in all areas across the food spectrum -- from sourcing ingredients to sustainability and more. These investments have helped it innovate its menu offerings, build out a digital app, and understand customer dynamics on a deeper level. As a result, the company is generating transformational growth in both revenue and profits.\n\nYet while all of this is encouraging, there is one more variable it's important to unpack before making a decision about whether or not to buy shares of Chipotle.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest in Chipotle stock before the split?\n\nWhen a stock split is on the horizon, the question of whether to buy shares before or after it takes place is a common conundrum for investors. Often, share prices rise following a split as more investors pour in and scoop up shares at a perceived lower cost.\n\nHowever, the lower price tag on the stock does not mean that you're actually buying in at a lower valuation. In fact, when momentum traders begin acquiring the stock and shares sharply rise, the market cap increases as well -- meaning that you're actually investing at a higher price point than was available before the split. CMG PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart illustrates Chipotle's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over the last five years. Although its P/E has normalized from its highs of a few years ago, Chipotle stock has historically been pretty pricey compared to the broader market.\n\nThat said, its long-term shareholders have been handsomely rewarded. Over the last five years, Chipotle has delivered a total return of 362%. By contrast, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF had a total return of 107%. Zooming out further, over the past 10 years, Chipotle stock has returned 453% compared to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF's return of 228%.\n\nAll things considered, Chipotle has been a terrific investment, and I suspect that dynamic will continue after the split later this month. Given its superior returns compared to funds that track the S&P 500, I'd say that Chipotle's premium valuation is warranted.\n\nI think the prudent strategy would be to scoop up shares of Chipotle before the split. However, in the grand scheme of things, it's not that important when exactly you buy this stock. Your investment thesis should be rooted in the fundamentals of the business as well as a conviction that Chipotle can fend off competition.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

These establishments feature an expanded menu selection priced above traditional fast food options, often incorporating fresher and cleaner ingredients to serve customers prioritizing quality.

Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and modern fast food stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 3.6% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nSweetgreen (NYSE:SG)\n\nFounded in 2007 by three Georgetown University alum, Sweetgreen (NYSE:SG) is a casual quick service chain known for its healthy salads and bowls.\n\nSweetgreen reported revenues of $157.9 million, up 26.2% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 3.9%.

Year-over-year, revenue grew 26% and Restaurant-Level Profit Margin expanded by 400 basis points to 18%. We delivered positive Adjusted EBITDA during a traditionally slower first quarter. We remain confident that our strategy positions Sweetgreen for success today as well as for long-term, capital efficient, profitable growth,\u201d said Jonathan Neman, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 2 Household-Name Stocks That Look Ready to Split",
        "content": "Stock splits are often misunderstood. They don't change the fundamental value of a company; instead, they increase the number of shares available, making them more accessible to a broader range of investors.\n\nIt's similar to peeling and segmenting an orange. The orange remains the same, but the smaller pieces are more convenient to consume.\n\nThis technical adjustment -- a pure exercise in accounting gymnastics, really -- can generate excitement in the market, as it often signals a company's strong performance and growth potential. For those seeking to take advantage of the buzz around stock splits, here are two outstanding investments on the verge of stock splits right now.\n\nKey details about Chipotle's upcoming stock split\n\nLet's start with the most obvious stock splitter. Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) proposed a 50-for-1 stock split on March 19, and shareholders will vote on the proposal in Thursday's annual meeting. The measure is likely to pass with an overwhelming majority.\n\nFirst, I can't recall a single example of ordinary stock splits getting a thumbs-down in the arena of shareholder approvals. Second, this would be the first stock split in Chipotle's history, and the share price is getting quite rich. Currently trading at $3,090 per share, there are only four beefier share prices on the American market today.\n\nAgain, the split won't add any value to Chipotle's market cap, but it will make the stock easier to manage -- especially for retail investors with modest stock-buying budgets. Some of us would have to save up for many months before grabbing a single Chipotle share today, and some of the most popular stock brokerages haven't embraced fractional trades yet. But after the suggested 50-for-1 split, the share price should drop to roughly $62 on the morning of June 26.\n\nChipotle stands out in the restaurant industry for many reasons. In an era of widespread franchising, Chipotle insists on owning its stores to control product quality and employee relations. Its career-oriented management style reminds me of Costco's (NASDAQ: COST), complete with generous worker benefits and solid pay scales.\n\nThe incoming stock split suggests that Chipotle's leadership expect share prices to keep rising for the foreseeable future. The company's focus on product quality and humane employee relations is setting new standards for the restaurant sector.\n\nI personally can't eat at Chipotle -- cilantro tastes like soap -- but it's an undeniably great company, and the stock split makes it more accessible.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Costco should consider a stock split soon\n\nSpeaking of Costco, the wholesale retailer should consider a stock split nowadays.\n\nCostco isn't a complete stranger to stock-splitting operations -- it has just been a while. Its last stock split was a 2-for-1 affair on Jan. 13, 2000. Costco's stock has seen a total return of 2,450% since then, leaving the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index far behind with a mere 477% gain: ^SPX Chart\n\nLike Chipotle, Costco is known for its employee-friendly environment. Its Kirkland selection of store-brand products is often indistinguishable from leading name-brand options. In fact, they're often made in the same factories, by the same market-leading producers, but packaged with a Kirkland label and sold at a lower price.\n\nAnd Costco runs its retail operations near the break-even line. The company is quite profitable anyway, thanks to its membership shopping system. Annual fees accounted for 1.9% of Costco's total revenue in last month's third-quarter report, but they also generated more than half of the company's operating profits.\n\nNow, Costco hasn't announced a stock split or arranged for a shareholder vote on the idea yet. But with share prices crossing the $800 mark last week, those stubs are getting a bit unwieldy. It would behoove Costco's board of directors to make the stock more easily reachable for individual investors -- including their own workers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Insiders At Chipotle Mexican Grill Sold US$42m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "content": "Many Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman & CEO, Brian Niccol, sold US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$3,195 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$3,076. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\n\nAll up, insiders sold more shares in Chipotle Mexican Grill than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Chipotle Mexican Grill. In total, insiders dumped US$33m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nDoes Chipotle Mexican Grill Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Chipotle Mexican Grill insiders own 0.7% of the company, currently worth about US$565m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Chipotle Mexican Grill Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold Chipotle Mexican Grill shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But it is good to see that Chipotle Mexican Grill is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill that deserve your attention before buying any shares.\n\nOf course Chipotle Mexican Grill may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock-Split Stock That Turned $1,000 Into $71,000",
        "content": "Over the long term, the stock market has been an incredible wealth-building machine for patient investors. For example, if you had invested $1,000 in the S&P 500 in 2006 and reinvested your dividends along the way, you'd have a stake worth about $6,000 today, an annualized return of 10.6%.\n\nThat's a safe way to grow your money. But if you had invested in some individual stocks as well, you might have a lot more. That's the beauty of a diversified portfolio. If one stock plummets, you can only lose the amount you put into it. But an investment that takes off can double or triple your money or gain even more, making up for the investments that go sour.\n\nGrowth investors can reap huge rewards over long periods of time. If you had invested $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) stock in January 2006 when it went public, you'd have a stake worth about $71,000 today. CMG Total Return Level Chart\n\nWhat Chipotle is doing right\n\nChipotle launched the fast-casual restaurant concept that has become part of American culture, and it's still a dominant force in that niche. Many chains have tried to replicate its success, some faring better than others, but none have achieved what Chipotle has. CEO Brian Niccol said on the recent earnings call, \"I believe the next Chipotle is Chipotle.\"\n\nCustomers love its fresh and healthy food at mid-range prices. The concept is popular among a more affluent demographic where spending remains resilient despite inflation, and who are still springing for fast-casual even if they're cutting down a bit on luxuries.\n\nChipotle has been through some difficult times, including several scandals and food-safety issues. Its stock hasn't always been a reliable grower. But since the company got a new CEO in 2018, it has fixed itself up and gone on an incredible run. It's an illustration of why identifying stocks with strong potential and then holding on for the long term is such a wise strategy.\n\nChipotle fairly consistently reports double-digit percentage revenue growth and strong comparable sales growth, as well as expanding margins and increasing profits. In 2024's first quarter, revenue increased 14% year over year, driven by a 7% increase in comparable sales. Operating margin widened from 15.5% to 16.3%, and earnings per share rose from $10.50 to $13.01.\n\nThere's still a massive opportunity\n\nNiccol explained that Chipotle has made major improvements in its processes that are leading to quicker service. Between that and some marketing campaigns, transactions jumped 5% in the first quarter, driving the higher comps result. As well as Chipotle is performing, it's still finding ways to improve.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle has already proven its concept and grown its business, and it's now expanding even further. Though it already has almost 3,500 stores, it sees the opportunity to grow that number to 7,000. It has moved beyond the urban centers where it's well established and is opening stores in more suburban areas, as well as in foreign markets. It's making more of a push into Canada, and it recently signed its first franchise agreement for stores in the Middle East.\n\nChipotle opened 47 new locations in the first quarter and plans to open about 300 during the full year.\n\nHow does the stock split play in?\n\nChipotle announced this month's 50-for-1 stock split in March. That's one of the largest stock-split multiples ever. Chipotle shares have a four-digit price tag, and companies often split their stocks when the price gets very high, since some investors may view that as a barrier to entry -- even in a time when most brokerages offer their clients the option of buying fractional shares. Stock splits don't change anything fundamental about a company -- they just divide its shares into smaller pieces -- but investors love them. And when a stock price gets high enough to justify a split, it usually indicates that the company is doing well, and the decision to conduct one signals that management expects the good times to continue.\n\nChipotle's market cap is up 34% so far this year, and investors can expect that to increase with the stock split. Long term, Chipotle is a winning stock that could add value to any retail investor's portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

For years, Chipotle has provided Real Food for Real Fans during basketball's highest level of competition in June.

        "content": "It\u2019s never a great feeling to be watching a stock go parabolic while you\u2019re sitting on the sidelines. Undoubtedly, none of us want to chase a hot stock just in time for the steep pullback. Though many parabolic rallies do end in a painful correction (or even a crash), not at all of them do. In fact, some parabolic moves may not fully reflect the positive change in the growth narrative and the fundamentals.\n\nHigh-flying GPU behemoth Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a top name that immediately comes to mind as a winner that just finds new ways to keep on winning for investors, including those who may have bought shares a bit late in the game.\n\nAlthough NVDA stock will eventually suffer a painful plunge, it remains to be seen where there are still multi-bagger moves left before the time comes. Though risky, Nvidia represents one of those rare generational names that can prove cheaper than originally thought, as it makes the most of the wind at its back.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three more hot runners that may have enough gas to keep going.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NASDAQ:CMG) keeps serving up hot gains for investors at a time when many folks are shunning quick-serve restaurants and fast-food joints in favor of home cooking. Undoubtedly, Chipotle may have the edge to take market share from rivals, even as prominent industry headwinds weigh.\n\nCompared to most other fast-food firms, Chipotle has the freshness factor down far better than its rivals. This allows the firm to command a higher price tag and, perhaps more remarkably, pass higher costs onto consumers amid inflation without having them run out the door.\n\nMoving ahead, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Bittner still views CMG stock as a great buy despite the stretched price tag and the hot run behind it (shares are up almost 40% year to date). They conducted a survey that found prices on certain goods, like chicken, have actually come down. In a post-inflation climate, Chipotle still looks positioned to win.\n\nAs the restaurants encounter a bit of deflation for the summer (hello, value menus!), Chipotle looks positioned to retain and continue growing its share. All considered, CMG stock has the catalysts it needs to keep its run going strong.\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there\u2019s a momentum stock out there that has more heat than Nvidia, it\u2019s high-flying data center equipment maker Vertiv (NYSE:VRT). Year to date, VRV stock has more than doubled, surging around 115%. In the past year, shares have soared over 400%\u2014a blistering move that is definitely not sustainable. Just because the road ahead won\u2019t be as prosperous as the one behind doesn\u2019t mean VRT stock is a name to scratch off your radar.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Nvidia, Vertiv stock doesn\u2019t look insanely expensive after its euphoric run at just 43.7 times forward P/E. It\u2019s striking just how robust the growth and magnitude of tailwinds are for the firm. With the company launching a new AI Hub ahead of Nvidia\u2019s next-generation chip launch, I would not be surprised if VRT continues to leave the rest of the market behind.\n\nAt some point, a serious pullback in VRT stock is in order. But until the P/E multiple swells markedly, I\u2019m just not sure when that time will be. If you consider yourself a risk-taker, perhaps the stock is worth nibbling on, even at close to $100 per share. Just be ready for wilder moves in the second half.\n\nWestern Digital (WDC) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Western Digital Corporation (WDC) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. WDC stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDon\u2019t forget about the data storage hardware firms, which are poised to thrive in the AI boom. Undoubtedly, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is a fantastic storage firm that many have discovered still has a lot to gain as the AI boom rolls on.\n\nDespite soaring more than 93% in the past year, I still find WDC stock to be an intriguing value option that may just have more room to run in the year ahead. At 12.0 times forward P/E, WDC stock may very well be the momentum stock to own if you\u2019re looking to play \u201ccatch up\u201d at this point in the AI race.\n\nDespite the heated run, the stock is nowhere close to all-time highs, which haven\u2019t been seen in nearly a decade. In any case, as a top storage hardware innovator who stands to benefit from a continuation of the steep cyclical upswing for storage hardware, I\u2019d not sleep on the name.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Walmart and Chipotle Soared After Announcing Stock Splits. Will Nvidia Be Next?",
        "content": "Stock splits seem to be coming back into vogue.\n\nAfter Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG), two of the higher-profile consumer goods stocks on the market, both announced stock splits earlier this year, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) became the latest closely watched stock to announce a split, telling investors during its earnings report on May 22 that would execute a 10-for-1 split on June 10.\n\nWith that move, Nvidia becomes the latest \"Magnificent Seven\" stock to reward investors with a stock split. In fact, out of the group of seven tech stocks, only Meta Platforms and Microsoft haven't done a stock split since the pandemic began.\n\nStock splits attract a lot of attention from retail investors, but they don't actually change the fundamentals of the stock or the business. A stock split effectively splits the shareholder \"pie\" into more pieces. For example, if you had 10 shares worth $10 each before a 2-for-1 split, you'd have 20 shares worth $5 each afterwards. However, the total value of stock you own would remain the same at $100.\n\nDespite the mathematical reality of a stock split, there's some evidence that stocks do better after a stock split. According to research from Bank of America, on average, stocks that split have historically returned 25% in the following year, compared to just a 12% return for the S&P 500.\n\nAhead of Nvidia's stock split, Walmart and Chipotle appear to offer the latest example of this pattern. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWalmart and Chipotle reward investors\n\nWalmart announced its first stock split in a generation earlier this year. The move came after several years of a strategic overhaul under CEO Doug McMillon, which modernized the company by building up the omnichannel and e-commerce businesses, embracing new growth opportunities like advertising, remaking its international portfolio (including acquiring India's Flipkart), and leveraging its strength in grocery.\n\nAs a result of those moves, Walmart handily outperformed the S&P 500 since the stock bottomed out in late 2015, when the market balked at McMillon's plan to ramp up capital expenditures to invest in stores. The stock has more than tripled since, leading Walmart to offer a 3-for-1 stock split, which it announced in late January.\n\nThe company said the move was designed to encourage its employees to participate in its stock purchase plan, giving them the opportunity to benefit from the company's rising stock price.\n\nSimilarly, Chipotle announced its first stock split ever earlier this year, coming after years of superior growth under CEO Brian Niccol. Niccol helped the burrito roller turn the page past the E. coli outbreak that pulled down the stock earlier, and the company has reported strong growth by embracing drive-thru with the Chipotlane concept as well as the digital and delivery channels.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen Chipotle announced a 50-for-1 stock split in March, it offered a similar explanation to Walmart, saying it would make the stock more accessible to employees and a broader range of investors.\n\nBoth Walmart and Chipotle have jumped since their stock split announcements.\n\nHow Nvidia is like Walmart and Chipotle\n\nWalmart and Chipotle both rewarded investors with stock splits, not just to make the shares more accessible to employees, but also because they're at the top of their games, executing near perfectly. Both companies delivered flawless first-quarter earnings reports in recent weeks and soared on the results, showing that the stock splits were also a sign of confidence from management. They're choosing to split their shares because they believe their stock prices will continue to climb.\n\nNvidia is in the same boat. The AI chip superstar has been posting blockbuster results since shortly after ChatGPT was launched, with revenue more tripling over the past year and profits growing even faster.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang talked up building \"AI factories\" on the recent earnings call, seeing his company as the end-to-end provider of all the hardware needed to run complex AI models like ChatGPT in the generative AI era, which he sees as the next industrial revolution. Nvidia is doing this when rivals like AMD and Intel are only just starting to launch their own data center GPUs designed for generative AI, showing that Nvidia has a huge head start.\n\nIn other words, Nvidia is clearly at the top of its game, as the recent earnings report reminded us as well.\n\nIn that sense, buying the stock because of the stock split is less about the mechanics of the split and its impact on the stock than it is about management's view of the company. What the stock split seems to say is that Nvidia's management, like Chipotle's and Walmart's, is confident that the stock price will continue to go up, and that the company is well positioned in the competitive landscape and will continue to execute and grow the business.\n\nThat, as much as any other factor, looks like a good reason to buy Nvidia stock, just as it's been a good reason to buy Walmart or Chipotle stock.

        "title": "Chipotle\u2019s CEO on his go-to order and the biggest challenge he had while working the counter",
        "content": "If you\u2019re stumped looking up at the menu of a Chipotle, you can take inspiration from CEO Brian Niccol\u2019s go-to order: a chicken burrito bowl with white rice, fajita veggies, pico de gallo, and \u201ca little\u201d cheese. That\u2019s in addition to an accompanying barbacoa quesadilla and, of course, chips and guac.\n\n\u201cIt's probably a little too much food for my age,\u201d Niccol told Fortune. \u201cBut, you know, it's hard to resist.\u201d\n\nThough he never worked behind the counter at Chipotle, Niccol has experienced firsthand what it takes to assemble his meal, among many others. After taking over as CEO of the fast-casual chain in 2018, part of Niccol\u2019s initiation was training at a location in Denver, where he learned how to prepare the chain\u2019s vegetables and toppings, manage the restaurant\u2019s peak lunch hours, and learn the skill that is perhaps most lauded among fast-food workers: bundling a burrito\u2019s ingredients into a tightly wrapped tortilla.\n\n\u201cWrapping a burrito is an art,\u201d Niccol said.\n\nSelf-admittedly slow to learn burrito wrapping and in need of repetition to become proficient on the line, Niccol admitted he \u201cripped a few too many\u201d tortillas during his training process. But the behind-the-counter experience gave him a deeper appreciation for the workers who prepare and serve Chipotle\u2019s meals, which helped generate $2.7 billion in first-quarter revenue for the company, and grew the company to over 3,300 locations in 48 states.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don't realize there's a lot of precision that goes into the way our teams make the rice, cook the chicken, cook the steak,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cIt really matters the way we cut, the way we prep everything. That was pretty eye-opening to see, especially at the scale at which we have to do it.\u201d\n\nHeaping on success\n\nBut if learning the art of burrito-wrapping was a steep learning curve for Niccol, reviving the company from a soured reputation must have been its own stomach ache for the new CEO.\n\nWhen Niccol became the company\u2019s leader in 2018, Chipotle was still reeling from the impact of its 2016 E. coli outbreaks that sickened over a thousand customers, forcing the company to temporarily shut down over 40 locations. Chipotle\u2019s comparable sales fell 20% year over year following the outbreak, and the company coughed up $25 million in 2020, the largest-ever fine in a federal food safety case.\n\nChipotle recovered under Niccol\u2019s guidance, thanks to a few key changes: It moved its headquarters from Denver to Newport Beach, Calif., to be closer to Irvine, where Niccol was wrapping up his tenure as CEO of Taco Bell, a subsidiary of Yum Brands and home to a talent pool of fast-food workers. He grew Chipotle\u2019s loyalty program and app, which helped the company keep customers coming back to its locations through the pandemic. Chipotle put increased emphasis on touting fresh ingredients and leaned into the open-kitchen layout of its restaurants, asking employees to think more like chefs and providing more information on each ingredient. Niccol said this attitude shift elevated a fast-food concept into more of a sit-down restaurant feel.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThere is something to the sights and sounds of Chipotle, hearing the grill and seeing guys chopping chicken and seeing people banging pans,\u201d Niccol told Fortune in 2023. \u201cYou want those sounds, and you want those smells.\u201d\n\nToday the company is grappling with decisions to raise prices to offset increases in wages, as well as consumer backlash over the ability to order some menu items only online\u2014including Niccol\u2019s favorite barbacoa quesadilla\u2014and portion sizes, which some say have dwindled. The accusations over skimpy burrito bowls have even led some customers to film employees preparing their meals, claiming workers heap on proteins and toppings in front of a phone camera. Niccol insists Chipotle\u2019s portions are just as generous as they\u2019ve always been.\n\n\u201cWe always want to give people big portions that get them excited about the food,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to double the amount of meat, you gotta pay for it, but our goal is to get people really excited about what I believe is really delicious food.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Specifically, both Nvidia and Chipotle have upcoming stock splits scheduled for June.\n\nWith shares of each continuing to soar, investors may be hard-pressed as to which company represents a more compelling position in the long run.\n\nLet's break down the benefits and opportunity costs of owning each stock, and assess which one looks like the superior choice.\n\nThe case for and against Nvidia\n\nThe chart below illustrates Nvidia's revenue, gross profit, and net income over the last 10 years. Clearly, the last couple of years have witnessed outsized growth compared to prior periods. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIt's no secret that Nvidia is a major player in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm. The company's H100, A100, and Blackwell graphics processing units (GPU) are in high demand with customers that include Tesla and Meta Platforms.\n\nWhat's really notable about the trends above is that Nvidia's growth is accelerating across both the top and bottom lines. By generating excess cash flow, Nvidia is able to reinvest profits into other growth drivers and bolster its long-term roadmap.\n\nWhile this is all positive, there are some risks that should be acknowledged. For now, Nvidia is estimated to have an 80% share of the AI chip market.\n\nHowever, rising competition from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and even big tech firms such as Amazon and existing customers like Meta pose a threat. Each of these companies is developing its own line of chips, which should eventually encroach on Nvidia's commanding lead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for and against Chipotle\n\nChipotle is best known for its tasty burrito wraps and bowls. With 40 million rewards members, Chipotle has undoubtedly built a loyal customer following with strong brand equity.\n\nOne of the ways that Chipotle has been able to capture the attention of so many consumers is due to the company's investments in digital sales strategies. CMG Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, Chipotle has been able to fund an extremely profitable operation. Its digital sales channels have helped fuel meaningful margin expansion, which in turn has flowed to the bottom-line. Although these financial results are encouraging, Chipotle stock does carry some risk.\n\nMacroeconomic factors such as inflation and interest rates can impact just about any business. While Nvidia is certainly not immune to these factors, I would argue that a restaurant chain such as Chipotle is more susceptible.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumer discretionary trends are highly sensitive and can fluctuate from year to year. I'd encourage investors to think about that dynamic as it relates to long-term growth prospects.\n\nAnd the winner is?\n\nThe final piece of this analysis revolves around valuation. As seen in the chart below, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of Chipotle and Nvidia illustrate vastly different trends. CMG PE Ratio Chart\n\nOver the last year, Chipotle's P/E has risen considerably -- now sitting at 65.7. By contrast, Nvidia's P/E is far lower than it was a year ago.\n\nAnother way of looking at this is understanding that, while each stock has risen sharply in the last year, shares of Nvidia are technically cheaper than they were 12 months ago. Why? Because the company's earnings growth is outpacing the acceleration of the stock price.\n\nAt the end of the day, Chipotle and Nvidia are two very different businesses.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Chipotle's fast-casual dining is a luxury purchase. While the operating results above indicate that the company can grow, it's important to remember that Chipotle sells burritos -- it's not exactly a proprietary business.\n\nOn the contrary, Nvidia sells a product that businesses of all sizes need. And while competition exists, I think that there are stronger longer-term secular tailwinds fueling AI as opposed to the food industry. If anything, Chipotle could become a customer of Nvidia as the company doubles down on its technology investments.\n\nStated differently, AI is so prolific that its applications span a variety of industry sectors, including food and beverage. I don't think the opposite is true, though. I don't see many reasons why Nvidia would ever be a Chipotle customer.\n\nConsidering the growth narrative surrounding AI, coupled with Nvidia's attractive valuation, I think the company is the better option compared to Chipotle.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle's Portion Sizes Have Gone Viral. What Could That Mean for the Stock?",
        "content": "The size of Chipotle's(NYSE: CMG) portions has come under scrutiny recently thanks to a viral trend on social media app TikTok -- customers have been videoing employees making their burrito bowls to make sure they were filling them properly.\n\nThe start of this trend can be traced to influencer Keith Lee, who has over 16 million followers, and who criticized the company for its shrinking portions. This prompted some Chipotle customers to begin videoing the chain's employees to incentivize them to give them more food. More and more customers followed suit.\n\nThis trend could impact the company's results and stock in the short term, and may have longer-term implications as well.\n\nMy recent Chipotle orders\n\nSince these complaints about Chipotle's portions went viral, I've ordered bowls from Chipotle twice from two different locations in two different states. Immediately following the hoopla, I placed a steak bowl order for pick-up through a drive-thru \"Chipotlane\" and received the fullest bowl I've ever gotten. No video was needed (or possible), and the portion size was great.\n\nTwo days later, I ordered two more bowls at my local Chipotle, and the results were completely different. One bowl was about half the size of the one I had gotten two days earlier and the other was maybe a third of that size. The chips were also stale.\n\nAfter I reached out to customer service, they gave me two BOGO (buy one, get one free) offers to use in the next 30 days and a free chips and guacamole reward. They also said they'd contact the store's manager.\n\nOver the past year, I have consistently had issues both with food quality and portions at my local Chipotle, which is one reason I've avoided the stock. However, given the strong sales momentum the company has seen during this time, my belief is that those were likely isolated issues relating to that single location. This is also an example of how anecdotal evidence is sometimes just that -- anecdotal -- and may not reflect the big picture.\n\nFor the company's part, Chipotle has said that it has neither altered its portion sizes nor instructed employees to give fuller bowls to customers who were recording them. The company did say that it had \"reinforced proper portioning\" with its employees, but did not indicate whether \"proper\" means keeping those portions moderate or filling the bowls up.\n\nBased on my recent experiences, there are big differences in portion sizes from one Chipotle location to the next. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow this could impact the company's results\n\nChipotle's biggest expense category is food, beverage, and packaging -- costs on that front represented 28.8% of its revenue in Q1. The company has been constantly fighting food inflation by boosting prices. However, another way for food companies to keep profits up when their costs are rising is by reducing portion sizes. This is commonly referred to as shrinkflation. President Biden even called out shrinkflation in his State of the Union address earlier this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the near term, if Chipotle does indeed increase its portion sizes to mollify its customers, that would increase its food expenses and hurt its restaurant-level margins. A 10% increase in expenses in the food, beverage, and packaging category from larger portions would add about $330 million a year in additional expenses (nearly $260 million after taxes), or about $9.40 in annual earnings per share (EPS), based on expected sales of $11.35 billion this year. That's not a small amount, even for a company on course to earn more than $55 per share this year.\n\nIn the long term, if Chipotle keeps its larger portion sizes, it would have a lasting impact on margins, while smaller sizes could have an impact on demand. Right now, there seems to be a bit of a battle between Chipotle and its customers over this issue.\n\nThis is a bit of a vulnerable time for the company. Many other quick-service chains have felt pressure from consumers struggling with higher menu prices. Chipotle has thus far avoided this, as evidenced by its strong same-store sales, pricing power, and traffic.\n\nSkimping on portions and quality may boost results in the near term, but eventually, it could catch up to the company. Chipotle has a good reputation and has bounced back from worse, including a number of food poisoning incidents related to E. coli and norovirus, but now, it needs to maintain that good reputation.\n\nI think the company missed an opportunity when Lee's complaint and other TikTokers' response to it went viral. It could have played into some marketing that would have driven more customers to its restaurants, perhaps for a limited time, by promoting the size of its bowls. The company's ambiguous response regarding its portion sizes also wasn't helpful.\n\nTime to buy, sell, or hold?\n\nChipotle stock now trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 55.5 -- a premium valuation relative to its growth and margin profile. It doesn't quite have the long expansion opportunity it has had in the past, so same-store sales and restaurant-level margins will play a bigger role in its long-term prospects. CMG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNot long ago, an event like the Chipotle portion saga would have likely been forgotten fairly quickly. Historically, consumers have had short memories when it comes to things like this. However, in the era of social media, consumers have been gaining more power. So I wouldn't 100% write it off as I would have done several years ago. I never thought Bud Light sales would still be impacted a year after calls by some to boycott the brand, so you never know.\n\nAt this point, given Chipotle's valuation, I'd view the restaurant stock as more of a hold while we wait to see whether this blows over as expected. I think it will, but I wouldn't rush to buy the stock at these levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Costco and Chipotle Investors Need to Learn This History Lesson",
        "content": "Both Chipotle(NYSE: CMG) and Costco(NASDAQ: COST) stocks have been huge winners for long-term shareholders. Their returns have more than doubled those of the S&P 500 index over the last 10 years, with Chipotle up 486% and Costco up 779%. The stocks have different but high-quality business models that have driven durable growth for many years, which should continue into the future.\n\nBut just because a business is good doesn't mean the stock is a buy. Investors looking at buying shares of Chipotle or Costco need to learn a history lesson from 50 years ago. COST Total Return Level Chart\n\nThe Nifty Fifty valuations\n\nIn the early 1970s, a lot of America's largest businesses saw their stock prices soar. These included well-known names like American Express and McDonald's. Investors started calling this group the Nifty Fifty -- 50 of the best stocks you could buy at any price. Or so the story went.\n\nAt its peak in 1972, the Nifty Fifty had a collective price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 42. This was more than double the S&P 500 average. Subsequently, the United States faced a major inflationary period that drove all stock valuations down. The Nifty Fifty were hit particularly hard due to their high starting P/E ratios.\n\nFor example, McDonald's grew its revenue at a 24% rate from 1972 through 1980. Earnings per share (EPS) grew at a similar clip. Despite this, in 1980 McDonald's shareholders who bought in 1972 were sitting on a cumulative loss of 35%. Adjusted for inflation, these returns were a lot worse. Despite huge growth in the underlying business, McDonald's was a poor investment because of its high starting P/E ratio, another reminder that price matters when buying a stock.\n\nThis brings us to Chipotle and Costco.\n\nCostco and Chipotle are more expensive than the Nifty Fifty\n\nChipotle and Costco have grown their sales at a consistent clip over the last 10 years. Chipotle's are up about 181% and Costco's are up 127% (cumulatively) over that time, which is similar but actually slower growth than McDonald's in the 1970s. With the stock prices soaring, a lot of investors seem to think this growth will be endless and that no price is too high to pay for Chipotle or Costco stock.\n\nThis will likely be foolish thinking. If you are buying Costco stock today, it trades at a P/E of 53. Chipotle is actually more expensive at a P/E of 65.5. Remember, the Nifty Fifty stocks traded at an average P/E of 42, which is significantly below what these two stocks trade at right now. A high P/E gives a stock more downside risk. Essentially, these two stocks are priced for perfection, which will likely lead to poor stock performance over the next 10 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWill Chipotle and Costco steadily grow their sales over the next decade? I think so. But these are not hypergrowth stocks that can grow into their earnings ratios within a few years. Costco's revenue only grew 5.7% year over year last quarter. This isn't Nvidia. At this pace, it will take the stock 10 years or longer to get back to an average market multiple. Same with Chipotle.\n\nIf valuations contract to a market average earnings multiple under 30, it is possible that both Costco and Chipotle post negative returns over the next 10 years. This is a major risk for investors buying today. COST PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe lesson investors need to learn\n\nWhen a slower-growing business is at an extreme earnings ratio it is unwise to buy its common stock. I think this is what is happening today with stocks like Chipotle, Costco, and even some others such as Wingstop (this one actually has a P/E above 100).\n\nThis doesn't mean existing shareholders need to sell, though. If a business maintains its high quality, there is no reason to sell even if the P/E gets over-extended in the interim. Especially when you consider capital gains taxes. In fact, for the few shareholders that held the Nifty Fifty stocks through the 1970s and into the 1990s, the basket of companies actually ended up outperforming the S&P 500. However, I don't believe this means it was smart for anyone to buy McDonald's in 1972.\n\nCostco, Chipotle, and other so-called unbeatable stocks feel eerily similar to the Nifty Fifty stocks of the early 1970s. Investors should take this as a history lesson and use it to avoid making mistakes with new buys in their portfolios today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Cava Group Stock?",
        "content": "Cava Group's (NYSE: CAVA) stock price has more than doubled since the beginning of the year. The fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain is expanding rapidly and building a customer base eager for new healthy fast-food choices.\n\nStill, such concepts do not necessarily translate into lucrative stock picks, and for every Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG), you can find numerous other restaurant stocks that have struggled to move higher over time. Fortunately for Cava shareholders, the business has made significant gains. The question for investors still on the sidelines is whether they have waited too long to buy the restaurant stock.\n\nThe state of Cava Group stock\n\nPart of the appeal of Cava Group is that many perceive it as a sort of second-chance stock for those who missed out on the approximately 140-fold gain in Chipotle delivered from its 2006 initial public offering (IPO) price to its current level.\n\nOn the surface, such a comparison makes sense. Both are fast-casual restaurants that emphasize food made with healthy ingredients. Also, since Cava specializes in Mediterranean cuisine, it does not compete with the Mexican food offered by Chipotle.\n\nMoreover, Cava operated 323 restaurants as of April 21 -- the end of its fiscal first quarter -- making it less than one-tenth the size of Chipotle and its approximately 3,500 locations. Achieving higher-percentage growth is easier from a smaller base, a factor that would presumably favor Cava.\n\nHowever, Cava could face more limitations than Chipotle. For one, Cava has stated a long-term goal of having 1,000 restaurants by 2032. While Cava could increase that target later, Chipotle management says it expects to eventually have 7,000 locations in North America, meaning it plans to grow more than Cava.\n\nCava could also struggle to attract more customers as quickly as it hopes. Despite the recent growth in the popularity of Mediterranean food, interest in it lags well behind Mexican food, another indication that Cava's growth potential might not match Chipotle's.\n\nImproving financials\n\nResults have justifiably stoked investor optimism for Cava. Its $259 million in fiscal first-quarter revenue was a 30% yearly increase. That's not as strong as its 60% surge in fiscal 2023, but it's still a rapid rise. Since same-restaurant sales climbed 2% yearly, most of the growth came from the 60 new restaurants the company opened during the trailing 12 months.\n\nThe company limited its operating expense growth to 22%, resulting in an operating profit. With that, net income for the fiscal first quarter was $14 million, improving from a $2 million loss in the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough management did not offer revenue guidance, it said it expects to open between 50 and 54 restaurants over the next year, which should help it maintain a rapid growth pace.\n\nStill, with the aforementioned share price increase, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has spiked to 13, well above Chipotle's ratio of 8. This is concerning given the challenging competitive landscape faced by Cava. Since Chipotle is a more developed chain offering a more popular cuisine, prospective investors may question whether Cava's stock is worth its premium price.\n\nWhere is Cava stock headed?\n\nAmid the continuing growth and rising valuations, the answer to the question of whether this is too late or too early to buy Cava stock depends on investors' point of view.\n\nThose who are not shareholders already might be too late to capitalize on the recent surge in the price. Those prospective buyers would have to pay a significantly higher valuation for the enterprise.\n\nHowever, management seems to have built a successful restaurant chain. Given its growth and rising popularity, it holds the potential to rise much higher over the long term, meaning investors still could be able to profitably buy into this company at this relatively early stage.\n\nInvestors who choose to buy now should probably accumulate their stakes gradually since the stock looks increasingly unpredictable in the near term.

        "title": "Move Over, Chipotle -- Cava Sees Revenue Surge. Time to Buy the Stock?",
        "content": "In the restaurant space, investors are constantly on the lookout for what company could become the next Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). And for good reason -- Chipotle's stock is up over 7,000% since it IPO'd back in 2006.\n\nThe latest contender is Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA), a Mediterranean restaurant fast-casual concept that has been growing its restaurant base quickly. The company reported strong revenue growth in the first quarter.\n\nLet's take a close look at Cava's most recent earnings report and see whether the stock makes good sense for investors now.\n\nA surge in revenue\n\nCava saw revenue for its fiscal Q1, which ended April 21, soar 30% to $256.3 million. The growth was aided by the company having 323 locations at period end versus 263 at the end of its fiscal Q1 a year ago. Same restaurant sales grew 2.3%, although the company said that adjusting for holiday shifts, it would have seen 4.3% growth. Cava saw a 3.5% benefit from menu price increases and mix, while guest traffic was down -1.2%.\n\nNotably, the company was facing difficult comparisons, as a year ago it saw same restaurant sales growth of 28.4%. Its restaurant level margins (RLM) ticked down slightly to 25.2% from 25.4%. This metric helps measure the profitability of its restaurants before corporate costs. Food costs as a percentage of revenue went down, but labor costs rose.\n\nThe company flipped to a profit, with earnings per share of $0.12 versus a loss of $1.30 a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA, meanwhile, nearly doubled to $33.3 million. Cava also generated $38.4 million in operating cash flow on the quarter and free cash flow of $4.7 million. This is important, as it shows the company can self-fund its restaurant expansion plans, which is one of the long-term key drivers for the stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAs a result of its solid start to the year, Cava also raised its full-year guidance. It now expects same restaurant sales growth to come in between 4.5% to 6.5%, from an earlier range of 3% to 5%, and for adjusted EBITDA of between $100 million to $105 million, up from a prior outlook of $86 million to $92 million. Cava also increased its expected restaurant openings for this fiscal year to between 50 to 54, up from an earlier view of 48 to 52 new locations.\n\nThe company said it does see a potential traffic headwind as the excitement that came with its IPO last year starts to fade. However, it is expecting the launch of a new grilled steak offering to help boost comps, given the favorable reception the dish has had in test markets in Boston and Dallas. Cava will also look to roll out a loyalty program by year-end, although its potential positive effect is not contemplated in its current guidance. The steak rollout will, however, be a slight headwind to its restaurant level margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, its expansion plans continue to remain on track, with locations now in 25 states and the District of Columbia. It said its recent entry into the Midwest with an opening in Chicago was met with strong results.\n\nTime to buy the stock?\n\nDespite a solid first quarter, Cava shares were falling following its latest report. One reason could be the stock's valuation which, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 230 times and a price-to-sales of 9.6 times, is not cheap. Even at an enterprise value to EBITDA basis, the stock trades at a hefty 87 multiple. Compared to other growing fast casual concepts such as Chipotle and Shake Shack, the stock is expensive. CAVA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, Cava has less than a tenth of the number of restaurants that Chipotle has in the U.S. currently. If the concept can remain popular and garner the same appeal throughout the U.S., Cava could potentially grow to become the size that Chipotle is today (nearly an $87 billion market cap) over the next 15 to 20 years. Note that Chipotle had under 500 locations in 20 states at the time of its IPO in 2006.\n\nThat would mean a lot of upside for Cava stock, which currently has about a $9 billion market capitalization. It's not easy projecting out a restaurant chain's success over the next two decades, as tastes do evolve. But the ingredients are in place for Cava to potentially be a huge winner despite its current expensive stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 High-Octane Stocks That Billionaires Are Buying",
        "content": "Following the stock selections of famous investors can be a great way to find future winners. These investors generally have excellent track records of beating the market's average returns, and because some of these professionals oversee billions of dollars in assets for their clients, they conduct exhaustive research before investing in a company.\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors were asked to identify three high-octane stocks that they favor and that billionaire investors have been buying recently. Their picks: Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), Coupang(NYSE: CPNG), and Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG).\n\nA fallen growth stock that could spring back to life\n\nJohn Ballard (Alibaba): Alibaba shares are trading well off their peak today. Economic headwinds from COVID-related issues weighed on consumer spending in China last year, which significantly impacted Alibaba's revenues, and the stock's moves reflected that. But this once fast-growing e-commerce and cloud computing leader could be turning a corner.\n\nOne billionaire investor who has acquired a sizable stake in the company is Appaloosa Management's David Tepper, who has an estimated net worth of $20 billion, according to Forbes. Tepper is a highly successful hedge fund manager, and his firm more than doubled its stake in Alibaba to $814 million during the first quarter.\n\nWhile Alibaba doesn't look like a high-octane stock right now, the opportunity it has to expand internationally through its AliExpress cross-border retail business, in addition to meeting the rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) services through Alibaba Cloud, could see the company's revenue growth improve in the coming years.\n\nAlibaba's revenue jumped 7% year over year in the March-ending quarter, driven by its market-leading Taobao and Tmall online retail businesses. It also reported strong demand for AI services in Alibaba Cloud. These results show the worst is likely behind the company now. Management noted in the last earnings report that the improved shopping experiences in Taobao and Tmall should help the retail group return to healthy growth in its fiscal 2025 (which will end in March 2025).\n\nWith the shares trading at a cheap forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.4, the stock could double in value if it moves closer to the market's average P/E of 21.\n\nThis e-commerce company is making all the right moves\n\nJeremy Bowman(Coupang): E-commerce presents one of the biggest growth opportunities in global business, and one of the more intriguing ways to get exposure to it is through Coupang, South Korea's leading e-commerce operator.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoupang is growing rapidly, expanding its profit margins, and borrowing liberally from the playbook that made Amazon into the titan it is today. It's expanding into new businesses like food delivery and video streaming, and it recently acquired Farfetch, the luxury online fashion marketplace. It's also investing in AI technology to help run its warehouses with robots.\n\nIn Coupang's most recent quarter, revenue jumped 28% on a currency-neutral basis to $7.1 billion, and its gross profit soared 36% to $1.9 billion, thanks in part to its recent price hike on its Prime-like Rocket Wow membership service.\n\nNot surprisingly, the stock has caught the attention of some billionaire investors. Stanley Druckenmiller, the mastermind behind Duquesne Capital Management, the hedge fund that delivered average annual returns of roughly 30% for nearly 30 years, counts Coupang as the second-largest holding in his family office, behind Microsoft.\n\nDruckenmiler hasn't explained why he likes Coupang, but the stock's combination of growth potential at a reasonable valuation is intriguing. The shares sport a P/E of 33.\n\nSome other billionaires who bought Coupang in the first quarter include Marc Stad, whose Dragoneer Investment Group fund purchased nearly 2 million shares, and Israel Englander of Millennium Management, who bought nearly 1 million shares.\n\nGiven the past success of e-commerce companies like Amazon and MercadoLibre, and Coupang's own growth potential, improving profitability, and reasonable valuation, it wouldn't be surprising to see more billionaire investors buy Coupang stock in the coming quarters.\n\nA perennial winner that could still make millionaires\n\nJennifer Saibil (Chipotle Mexican Grill): Chipotle has probably minted a few millionaires over its years on the stock market, and it has been a mainstay in billionaire Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital equity portfolio.\n\nIn the first quarter, Ackman actually sold some shares, but it might have been to rebalance the portfolio. Pershing Square only owns eight stocks, and even after the sale, Chipotle stock is up from 18% of the total to 20%.\n\nWhile Ackman sold, other billionaire investors were buying in. Ken Griffin of Citadel Investors, for example, bought 135,356 shares in the first quarter. Chipotle stock is up 35% this year, and it's been a reliable gainer for most of its time as a public company.\n\nInvestors love Chipotle, and for good reason. It regularly reports double-digit percentage increases in revenue, driven by strong comparable sales growth. Earnings per share (EPS) consistently grow. That trend was on display in Q1, with a 14% year-over-year increase in sales and a 7% boost in comparable sales. EPS rose from $10.50 to $13.01.\n\nPlus, there's another reason Chipotle stock has been off to the races this year. In March, management announced a 50-for-1 stock split that will take place in June. Stock splits usually indicate that a company's management team is confident about its future, and even though they don't do anything to alter the value of the underlying business, investors love them. Chipotle shares have been trading above $1,000 for a while, so this split was probably overdue.\n\nThis fast-casual chain is an all-weather winner with plenty more growth ahead. Retail investors should join the billionaires in adding Chipotle shares to their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Stock splits occur when companies divide their shares into multiple lower-priced units without changing their market caps, which is the value of all the shares combined.\n\nThink of it like a pizza. Whether the pieces are small or large, the size of the pie remains the same, but it can be divided into as many slices as you want. This tactic can be a great way to make an expensive stock more liquid and attractive to smaller investors with less cash available.\n\nAfter enjoying explosive rallies over the last five years, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) have decided to split their stocks. Let's explore what this could mean for long-term investors of these two stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWith shares up by a nosebleed-inducing 2,800% in just five years, Nvidia has a lot of incentive to keep its stock price more accessible for investors who don't have thousands of dollars lying around.\n\nOn May 22, the technology giant announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which will go into effect on June 10. The soon-to-be lower stock price could boost Nvidia's liquidity and help investors overcome the psychological barrier to buying a company currently trading for four figures. Meanwhile, Nvidia's fundamentals remain excellent. And it dominates the market for advanced generative artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue soared 262% year over year to $26 billion, driven by sales of graphics processing units (GPU) like the H100 and H200 to data center clients. The company plans to cement its lead over rivals by speeding up its chip upgrade cycle from every two years to every year. The new chips could enjoy robust demand because they make training AI models faster and more energy efficient. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDespite its high price tag, Nvidia stock is still relatively affordable from a valuation perspective. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 41, it's cheaper than rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, which is valued at 47 times forward earnings despite a revenue growth rate of just 2% in its most recent quarter. (Remember, Nvidia grew sales by 262%.)\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nWhile tech companies are typically known for breakneck growth rates, sometimes restaurants can also soar by tackling an old industry in an exciting new way. With shares up 376% over the last five years (to around $3,151), the Mexican-inspired fast-casual chain Chipotle has become a victim of its own success. Management thinks a lower stock price could be beneficial to its long-term goals.\n\nChipotle's massive 50-for-1 stock split, which goes into effect on June 18, will dramatically lower its stock price and make it more liquid for smaller retail investors who might not have access to fractional shares. More importantly, the split may help the company improve its operational performance by allowing it to reward top-performing managers with more specific increments of stock, which is hard to do with the high price tag.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe goal is to improve throughput (a metric that measures how fast customers move through the line) by having a more skilled and motivated workforce with a sense of ownership in the company.\n\nChipotle is also on the cusp of a major international expansion that will bring its unique fast-casual Mexican concept to new markets like Europe and the Middle East. In April, the company opened its first restaurant in Kuwait and plans to open several Dubai locations this year.\n\nFocus on the fundamentals\n\nStock splits are generally a bullish signal because they usually follow sustained stock-price appreciation. That said, investors shouldn't lose sight of fundamentals. With its rapid growth rate and low valuation, Nvidia remains one of the most attractive stocks on the market right now. Chipotle is also a great pick because of its strong brand and international expansion potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 S&amp;P 500 stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now",
        "content": "Most investors are likely familiar with the S&P 500. This index includes around 500 publicly traded stocks, representing the largest companies in the U.S. It also gives a glimpse into the general state of U.S. business, the economy, and markets -- which is why it's so closely followed.\n\nSo far this year, the index is up around 10%. You can buy a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the index as a convenient way to gain exposure to the broader market, but individual stocks are worth considering as well to help you maximize your investment opportunities.\n\nCarnival(NYSE: CCL), Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG), and Home Depot(NYSE: HD) are three top choices to look at right now. Here's why.\n\nThe leading cruise operator\n\nCarnival is the world's largest cruise company, but it's still struggling with the fallout of closing early in the pandemic. Revenue is back up, and record first-quarter sales of $5.4 billion exceeded pre-pandemic figures. Demand is strong, with record Q1 deposits of $7 billion in fiscal 2024's first quarter (ended Feb. 29). Carnival entered the year in its best-ever booked positions, and it's been booking out a longer curve at higher prices.\n\nBut profitability is still down. Carnival was once reliable for profit generation, and it's working to get back there. Its net loss, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), declined by more than $500 million to $214 million in Q1, and the adjusted net loss came in better than expected at $180 million.\n\nThe main problem hanging over its head right now is its heavy debt load. It piled on debt to stay open when it wasn't taking in revenue, and even though it's been rigorous about managing to pay back efficiently, it still has more than $28 billion in long-term debt. In Q1, it redeemed $1 billion of its highest-interest notes while upsizing a $400 credit facility to maintain a healthy financial position. But investors are going to be cautious about Carnival stock until the debt is at a safer level.\n\nCarnival stock made a big comeback last year as its business rebounded, but it's down 21% this year. At the current price, it trades at a dirt-cheap price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 0.9. It may go sideways before it heads back up, but long term, it should return to being a market-beating stock. This is an excellent entry point that you don't want to miss.\n\nThe favorite fast-casual chain\n\nChipotle continues to dazzle eaters with its healthy, fresh fare even as it pleases investors with its sales growth and profit generation. It consistently reports increasing revenue, comparable sales, and earnings per share (EPS) -- all despite economic volatility -- and management still sees huge expansion opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the most recent update, for Q1 2024, revenue increased 14% year over year, driven by a 7% increase in comparable sales. Earnings were up from $10.50 to $13.01 per share. The restaurant chain opened 47 new stores in the quarter and plans to open about 300 in total for the full year.\n\nChipotle is the only stock on this list that's beating the market so far this year, and it's up 37%. There are several reasons: overall growth and resilience; quarterly performance; and a third element that's unique to this time -- a 50-for-1 stock split that's one of the biggest-ever stock splits on the market. That got a lot of attention and buoyed the stock price even higher.\n\nSo why is it a screaming buy right now? Because it's likely to keep climbing, and the sooner you get in, the longer your money can work for you. Chipotle stock isn't cheap, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 67. But believe it or not, that's below its 5-year average of 77. The shares trade at a premium because the company is so reliable for growth.\n\nThe largest home-improvement chain\n\nHome Depot is the largest home-improvement chain in the world, with more than 2,300 stores in North America. It has a robust omnichannel structure, it has invested heavily in creating a strong digital network, and it has recently made some key acquisitions that generate new opportunities.\n\nHowever, it's struggling in the inflationary environment. There are several ways it's been impacted. The real estate market is pressured due to sky-high mortgage rates, and homeowners aren't moving. That means fewer home-improvement projects. Even people who are buying are holding off on large purchases, and some shoppers are pushing off non-essential repairs and purchases altogether.\n\nSales decreased 2.3% year over year in fiscal 2024's first quarter (ended April 28) with comps sliding 2.8% and EPS down from $3.92 to $3.83. Some good news was that digital sales increased 3.3% over last year.\n\nComparable sales fell 1.5% from last year; the average ticket was down 1.3%; and comparable transactions over $1,000 slid 6.5%. This indicates that the comps' decrease was more about price than traffic.\n\nHome Depot stock has fallen 6% this year. This brings its P/E ratio down to its 5-year average of 21.8. When sales get back to growth, expect Home Depot stock to get back to growth, too, and deliver market-beating results.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Carnival Corp. wasn\u2019t one of them.

Jeremy uses Fibonacci retracement levels like a map. There are no guarantees with the retracement levels. Sometimes they hold, and sometimes they do not. And this includes both to the upside and to the downside.\n\nThe retracement levels are meant to be a guideline. But investors and traders can use them as another arsenal in their technical toolbox, in addition to knowing the company's fundamentals.\n\nJeremy and Tracey looked at a bunch of hot stocks that have hit Jeremy's top Fibonacci retracement levels, to see where the sell-off Fibonacci retracement levels could possibly be.\n\nMissed out on the trade? There are always pullbacks and sell offs in stocks. Yes, even NVIDIA has pulled back in the last year.\n\nWhat price should you be looking at for the pullback?\n\n5 Hot Stocks and Their Fibonacci Retracement Levels\n\n1. Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT\n\nVertiv provides infrastructure solutions and services in the areas of data centers, communication networks and commercial and industrial facilities including cooling and power. It is an AI play.\n\nShares of Vertiv have soared 115% year-to-date and are trading near all-time highs. As Jeremy discusses in the podcast, there have been few opportunities to get in on a pull-back on Vertiv so far as the stock has steadily ground higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat are Vertiv's Fibonacci retracement levels?\n\n2. Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI\n\nSuper Micro Computer has been one of the big AI and data center winners of the last year. Sales are expected to jump 109.7% this year.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer have soared 188% year-to-date. But this is an instance where the stock IS pulling back. Super Micro Computer is down 5.5% over the last 3 months.\n\nIs Super Micro Computer closing in on key Fibonacci retracement levels right now?\n\n3. Costco Wholesale Corp. COST\n\nCostco has a cult-like following among both shoppers and stock investors. Sales are expected to rise 4.6% in fiscal 2024.\n\nShares of Costco have been hitting new all-time highs, gaining 23.6% year-to-date. Who dares to buy it at these lofty levels?\n\nJeremy has a Fibonacci retracement level at a much lower price than current levels. Should you be a buyer of Costco if it gets there?\n\n4. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.CMG\n\nChipotle is one of the top restaurant stocks this year. Shares of Chipotle have soared 34% year-to-date to new all-time highs.\n\nChipotle is still doing double digit sales growth as well, with sales expected to rise 15% in 2024. The company is doing a 50-to-1 stock split on June 6, 2024, so keep that in mind when watching Jeremy discuss Fibonacci retracement levels.\n\nWhat are the Fibonacci retracement levels telling us about Chipotle?\n\n5. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nDid you miss out on the pullback in NVIDIA earlier this year? Shares of NVIDIA have skyrocketed, again, after the recent earnings report. The stock is up 28.7% over the last 4 weeks. NVIDIA is up 128% for the year.\n\nSales are expected to soar in fiscal 2025, up 91%.\n\nAll stocks have pullbacks.

        "title": "The 2 Best Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "The revival of stock splits has been one of the more noteworthy market trends in recent years. Companies generally embark on this course of action after years of consistently strong business and financial performance have driven the share price into the stratosphere. While a stock split doesn't change the intrinsic value of the company, it does make shares more affordable for employees and the general public, a reason that is frequently cited by companies as the primary reason behind the split.\n\nHowever, investors should look to the robust underlying results that led to a stock split in the first place because consistently strong business performance is the best reason to own a stock.\n\nIt stands to reason, then, that companies that have recently announced or conducted stock splits are fertile ground for future gains. Let's take a look at two companies that are ripe for the picking. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been making headlines over the past year or so, and it's easy to understand why. Recent developments in the field, namely generative AI, can simplify a number of routine tasks, helping make workers more productive. Imagine systems that can prioritize emails and draft responses, quickly find and summarize documents related to a particular topic, and generate presentations from available data -- all from a few simple prompts.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs) that underpin this revolutionary technology. As such, when the AI revolution kicked off early last year, it drove demand for Nvidia's processors to record heights, and it shows no signs of slowing.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year sales and profit gains. Record quarterly revenue of $26 billion soared 262% year over year, driving earnings per share (EPS) to $5.98, an increase of 629%. Management expects Nvidia's growth spurt to continue, calling for second-quarter revenue of $28 billion, up 107%.\n\nLest there be any doubt, it's the accelerating adoption of generative AI that's driving the results. Nvidia's data center segment, which includes cloud computing and AI processors, hit record sales of $22.6 billion, up 427%.\n\nWith the stock up 3,000% over the past five years, management announced a 10-for-1 stock split that will take place in June. Nvidia also increased its dividend by 150% to $0.01 on a post-split basis. With a yield of 0.04%, it's certainly nothing to write home about, but it forms the foundation for meaningful increases in the future, especially since it boasts a payout ratio of less than 3% of profits.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nIt takes an extraordinary business to continue its growth during the worst period of economic contraction in more than a decade, but Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) did just that. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds of the past few years, the company grew comparable store sales (or \"comps\") in each and every quarter going back to the start of 2022. That's a testament to the strong demand for Chipotle's \"food with integrity.\"\n\nThe company kicked off the year in style, with revenue growing 14% year over year to $2.7 billion, while diluted EPS of $13.01 surged 24%. Comps continued to shine, increasing by 7%, driven by increased customer visits and Chipotle's unmatched pricing power. Perhaps as importantly, restaurant-level operating margins continued their unrelenting trek higher to 27.5%, up from 25.6% in the year-ago period.\n\nFurther fueling its robust growth is the company's wildly successful digital strategy, as Chipotle's rewards program surpassed 40 million members earlier this year. Another big drive is the company's Chipotlanes, the dedicated drive-thru just for mobile orders. Management notes that locations with Chipotlanes generate higher sales and increase profit margins. As a result, digital orders are growing faster than overall sales and represented 37% of total food and beverage revenue in the first quarter.\n\nChipotle stock hit a new all-time high earlier this month. With gains of 375% over the past five years, management announced a 50-for-1 stock split, which will take place in June. Management called it \"one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange history.\"\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Rises As Market Takes a Dip: Key Facts",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) ended the recent trading session at $3,105.84, demonstrating a +1.07% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.6%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.86%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.08%.\n\nShares of the Mexican food chain witnessed a loss of 2.1% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Retail-Wholesale sector with its gain of 1.07% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.15%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Chipotle Mexican Grill in its upcoming release. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $15.57, reflecting a 23.08% increase from the same quarter last year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $2.92 billion, indicating a 16.26% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $55.31 per share and a revenue of $11.35 billion, indicating changes of +23.29% and +14.96%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Chipotle Mexican Grill. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.41% higher within the past month. Right now, Chipotle Mexican Grill possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Chipotle Mexican Grill has a Forward P/E ratio of 55.56 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 19.09.\n\nIt's also important to note that CMG currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.44. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The average PEG ratio for the Retail - Restaurants industry stood at 1.71 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 176, putting it in the bottom 31% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Chipotle\u2019s CEO made it to the C-suite by 33. Here are his 3 tips for success",
        "content": "There\u2019s no shortage of CEOs dispensing wisdom at a lectern these days. But according to Brian Niccol, the 50-year-old chief executive and board chairman of Chipotle Mexican Grill, new grads don\u2019t need to grasp much beyond the basics.\n\nNiccol delivered the commencement speech earlier this month at Miami University in Ohio, where he graduated in 1996. His bottom line to graduates, he explained in a Wednesday interview with Fortune, was \u201cjust a couple of simple things.\u201d\n\nThe first few are straightforward. Be a person who believes in yourself and others; be a doer. (In his commencement address, he shouted out six graduating seniors who worked at the local Chipotle during college\u2014those were \u201cserious doers,\u201d he said.) Then Niccol struck a more patriotic tone. \u201cYou have to understand our country, and what it provides,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cIf you understand the history of America, if you understand what democracy is in America, I think you have the ability, then, to defend and grow this country and do even greater things [with] the opportunities that are presented today.\u201d\n\nThen he circled back to the bigger picture. \u201cI recommend to these folks: Be a friend; take the time to invest in relationships,\u201d Niccol said. \u201cI think friendships last forever, and when people need you to celebrate a success\u2014or, unfortunately, need a shoulder to deal with some tragedy, you'll really appreciate having those relationships.\u201d\n\nPerhaps graduates would do well to take Niccol\u2019s advice on relationships, self-confidence and determination\u2014Niccol himself has found great success.\n\nAfter graduating from Miami Ohio, Niccol began his career in brand management at Procter & Gamble, where he worked for a decade. In November 2005, he pivoted to food, where he\u2019s been ever since. He took a VP-level role at Yum! Brands, the fast-food conglomerate that\u2019s home to Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC, where he ended up rising through the ranks for another decade-plus. His time at Yum! culminated with a CEO appointment at Taco Bell, a position he held for three years\u2014until fast casual came calling.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill tapped Niccol, then 44, for the top job in February 2018, when the brand was in crisis, weathering a lowered stock price, drop in customers, and an unfortunate handful of foodborne illness outbreaks, which resulted in a $25 million federal fine.\n\n\u201cBack when the news was breaking about what was happening in China, I remember asking our person in charge of wellness and food safety, \u2018What will we need to change in order to make sure we\u2019re doing everything possible in regard to COVID-19?\u2019\u201d Niccol told Fortune in 2021. \u201cHer response was, \u2018The good news is we\u2019ve already put in the air filtration systems. We\u2019re already doing wellness checks. We\u2019re already getting paid sick leave. We have zero tolerance around working if you have any symptoms. We were already very aggressive with hand washing, hand sanitizing, wearing gloves.\u2019\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNiccol, alongside longtime CFO Jack Hartung, has been credited with turning the ship around and reinvigorating the chain\u2014and deepening customer loyalty. Chipotle debuted on the Fortune 500, at No. 464, in 2021, when most of the restaurant industry was in pandemic-era freefall. Today, it\u2019s in spot 438.\n\nIn 2023, Niccol earned\u00a0 compensation valued at $22.4 million. That\u2019s 1,354 times as much as the median Chipotle employee\u2019s pay in 2023, which was $16,595 according to Chipotle, but the burrito purveyor has outpaced its peers in worker wages, with a starting hourly pay of $17\u2014above minimum wage.\n\n\u201cWe had a really strong balance sheet, a really strong people culture, and a really strong digital proposition that helped us weather the storm,\u201d Niccol remarked of Chipotle\u2019s recovery in 2021. \u201cThe scale definitely helps, but I think you can\u2019t ever underestimate the creative spirit and resiliency of the restaurant entrepreneur.\u201d\n\nCreative spirit and resiliency are always assets, but maybe they also know a thing or two about U.S. History.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Chipotle CEO: Our portion sizes aren\u2019t getting smaller\u2014but you can get more food with a special look",
        "content": "Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol denies claims that the Mexican grill\u2019s portion sizes have been shrinking, despite hundreds of people taking to Reddit and TikTok with their complaints.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Niccol said \u201cportions have not gotten smaller,\u201d and offered disappointed customers seeking an even bigger burrito or bowl a pro tip: Give the workers a secret look.\n\nThe specialty taco and burrito eatery, which is historically known for its big portion sizes, has been caught in a monthslong crossfire with angry customers who insist the portions have shrunk while prices have been hiked higher. Despite the upset, Chipotle\u2019s CEO denied the claims and seemed to encourage customers to indirectly ask for more food by giving workers a \"look\"\u2014but the tip might just be a confusing, indirect method to get more food than asking politely, which is, of course, still an option.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I think is great about Chipotle is if you come into the restaurant and you want a little more rice or you want a little more pico [de gallo],\u201d Niccol told Fortune, who then widened his eyes slightly and nodded his head, \u201cusually our guys and women give them a little more scoop.\u201d\n\nNiccol acknowledged how big portions are part of the image of the brand, telling Fortune that \u201cit\u2019s kind of who we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always want to give people big portions that get them excited about the food,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIf you want to double the amount of meat, you gotta pay for it, but our goal is to get people really excited about what I believe is really delicious food.\u201d\n\nHundreds of customers who have taken to Reddit and TikTok with their gripes about the chain seem to think otherwise. On the Chipotle subreddit, one user wrote, \u201cI used to eat Chipotle 2-3x a week. I haven\u2019t been in a year. It\u2019s inconsistent, expensive, and the portions are terrible.\u201d\n\nAnother user wrote, \u201cAt least skimping on chicken/meat may make financial sense to them. They are skimping rice and beans on veggie bowls. That\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nThe public dissent is also leading some to try other secret\u2014and questionable\u2014methods in hopes of getting a bigger meal, like filming workers while they prepare orders. This particular method blew up on TikTok, where a handful of influencers believed they were getting more food because they were filming their meals being made, leading them to instruct others to do the same for similar results.\n\nThere\u2019s currently a \u201cmethod\u201d going around for Chipotle, basically you film them while they make your food which makes them not skimp out on the portions because they don't want the bad publicity or reviews \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/VU4NX7a9hz\n\n\u2014 FearBuck (@FearedBuck) May 26, 2024\n\nThe move to record workers is questionable at best, with some expressing discomfort with the trend. One Chipotle employee posted to Reddit, \u201cI\u2019m not dealing with getting videoed [because] someone\u2019s sad about portions. Sorry that corporate sucks, but I can\u2019t do anything about it and I sympathize with some customers. I try to give more than I\u2019m supposed to. But a camera in my face is dehumanizing.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle seemed to address the trend in its own post to TikTok on May 23, which conveys a crowd of people holding out their phones and appearing to take videos in front of the counter line at a Chipotle restaurant. It also released a statement saying there\u2019s no guarantee that filming your meal being made will lead to more food on your plate, or bowl.\n\nThe noise about portion sizes at Chipotle comes after the chain announced price hikes several times since 2021, which the company said was meant to offset the cost of paying employees higher wages; it plans to continue raising prices this year to keep up with the costs of goods. The eatery most recently announced price hikes last October, marking the fourth time the chain raised prices in the past two years. Other chains, including McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell, also raised prices over the last two years.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Retirement is getting more difficult to attain as the cost of living rises. Any career interruptions can make the path more challenging as well. It\u2019s important to approach retirement plans knowing these facts.\n\nUnderstanding this context can inspire you to build your retirement portfolio\u00a0at a faster pace\u00a0and stay sharp with your financial habits. It can also be incredibly satisfying once you\u00a0build\u00a0up a retirement portfolio despite elevated living costs.\n\nWhile investors can take many approaches with their retirement portfolios, these picks are geared for high returns rather than blue-chip picks that offer high yields. Retirement is at least a decade away for most people, and these stocks have the potential to reward investors quite nicely during that time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthy sports beverages that have captivated consumers and investors.

Consumers are willing to pay a premium for Chipotle\u2019s meals due to its healthier options.\u00a0Fast food\u00a0restaurants that sell unhealthy food are having a more difficult time gaining market share as companies like Chipotle continue to thrive.\n\nThe fast food restaurant chain reported 14.1% YOY revenue growth in\u00a0Q1 2024.

        "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nChipotle has given its owners great returns over the past five years, with the stock up by nearly 360%. Investors are increasingly paying attention to another stock in the industry, Cava Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA), a much smaller chain.\n\nFocused on Mediterranean cuisine, Cava\u2019s stock has increased by 112% year to date. This momentum raises the question of whether Cava offers a unique investing opportunity.\n\nCava\u2019s Business Model and Rapid Growth\n\nLike Chipotle\u2019s, Cava\u2019s business concept lets patrons create salads, grain bowls, or pitas. Management credits growing public awareness of better dietary options as a driver of success, while Cava\u2019s fast-casual style improves accessibility and convenience for its customers.\n\nAmid inflation and economic uncertainty, Cava has shown great growth. Its sales increased by 59.8% in 2023, thanks to 72 new stores opening and 17.9% more sales at existing stores. Last year, the company made $729 million in sales, 518% more than the previous year.\n\nHigh-growth businesses often lose money, but Cava generated a net income of $13.3 million last year after losing $59 million the year before.\n\nThe chain reported 309 stores on Dec. 31, 2023, and the leadership team has ambitions to scale to 1,000 outlets throughout the United States by 2032.\n\nTrending:Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nHigh Expectations and Valuation Concerns for Cava\n\nInvestors hope that Cava can replicate Chipotle\u2019s long-term success. With 3,500 locations, Chipotle continues to expand rapidly, opening 271 new stores last year. Its strong revenue and earnings growth have made its shares attractive to investors.\n\nExpectations for Cava are high, with its stock trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 11.1, a 30 percent premium over Chipotle. However, this high valuation raises questions about its justification.\n\nCava\u2019s valuation suggests management will achieve its goal of opening 1,000 stores ahead of the 2032 target.\n\nThe company plans to open 50 net new sites in 2024, a decrease from the previous year.\n\nAlso, same-store sales are only expected to rise by 3% to 5%, which is very different from last year\u2019s growth of 10% or more. Chipotle expects similar sales growth in the mid-to-high-single-digit range this year, even though it is larger and has a greater percentage of the U.S. market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Real Opportunity In Today's Market\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, Basecamp Alpine Notes offers a target APY of 9% with a term of only three months, making it a powerful short-term cash management tool with incredible flexibility. EquityMultiple has issued 61 Alpine Notes Series and has met all payment and funding obligations with no missed or late interest payments. With a low minimum investment of just $1,000, Basecamp Alpine Notes makes it easier than ever to start building a high-yield portfolio.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this Mexican food chain have returned -2.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which Chipotle belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nChipotle is expected to post earnings of $15.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $55.31 points to a change of +23.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $66.53 indicates a change of +20.3% from what Chipotle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Chipotle.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMG _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Chipotle, the consensus sales estimate of $2.92 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.3%. The $11.35 billion and $12.83 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15% and +13%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nChipotle reported revenues of $2.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.1%. EPS of $13.37 for the same period compares with $10.50 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.01%. The EPS surprise was +14.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nChipotle is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Chipotle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Blue-Chip Bubble Trouble: 7 Stocks to Short as Valuations Stretch to the Limit",
        "content": "If you\u2019re wondering which overvalued blue-chip stocks to ditch right now, look no further. The best investors pay attention to a stock\u2019s valuation. Warren Buffett famously avoids buying stocks that are trading at more than 15 times future earnings estimates. Any stock with a higher multiple is too expensive for the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett\u2019s most recent stock purchase, Swiss insurer Chubb (NYSE:CB), is trading at a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11 times future earnings forecasts.\n\nWithin the benchmark S&P 500 index, the average P/E ratio is currently just over 27, having risen along with the bull market that began 18 months ago. Stocks are compared to the average multiple to determine whether they are expensive relative to their peers. Some stocks justify a high valuation due to their strong earnings growth and share price appreciation. Others are dangerously overvalued and destined for a correction.\n\nHere is blue-chip bubble trouble: seven stocks to short as valuations stretch to the limit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) have performed well, rising 120% in the past 12 months, including a 40% gain on the year. In the last five years, CRWD stock has increased 444%. While the share price appreciation has been impressive, the growth has made CrowdStrike a very expensive stock to own. The company\u2019s shares are currently trading at 950 times future earnings estimates.\n\nSome investors might feel the premium valuation is justified as CrowdStrike continues to grow at a brisk clip. CRWD stock rose 23% in one day during March after the company reported fourth quarter 2023 financial results that beat Wall Street estimates and raised its forward guidance. On an earnings call, management reiterated their goal of achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2030.\n\nWhile CrowdStrike has been one of the best performing cybersecurity stocks, there\u2019s no denying that the shares are expensive right now. The company next reports earnings on June 4.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nData analytics company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is also richly valued, trading at 165 times future earnings forecasts. Like CrowdStrike, Palantir stock has been a strong performer, rising 43% in the past year and climbing 26% so far in 2024. However, the valuation on PLTR stock is starting to look stretched with the shares trading at such a high multiple relative to earnings expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Denver, Colorado-based company recently reported EPS of 8 cents, yet its stock is trading at nearly $21 a share. While the company has posted a profit for six consecutive quarters, analysts are raising concerns about the lofty valuation. The high P/E ratio is the main reason why there is a consensus \u201chold\u201d rating on Palantir stock among 12 Wall Street analysts who cover the company.\n\nPalantir builds artificial intelligence (AI) software for governments and corporations, and its stock looks to have gotten caught up in the AI trade this year, pushing up the valuation.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAhead of its upcoming 50-for-1 stock split, one of the biggest in market history, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is trading at a lofty valuation for a quick service restaurant chain. Currently, CMG stock is trading at 67 times future earnings forecasts. That compares to a valuation of 21 times earnings estimates for rival McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). Not only does Chipotle have a high valuation but its share price is out of reach for many investors trading at more than $3,100.\n\nThe stock split is meant to help with the affordability of Chipotle\u2019s shares. However, the valuation is likely to remain rich as investors pay a premium to own the fast-growing restaurant chain that specializes in Mexican cuisine. CMG stock has grown 52% in the last 12 months, bringing its five-year growth rate to 375%. Chipotle has been one of the best-performing stocks to own in the restaurant sector.\n\nWhile CMG stock has been rallying leading up to the stock split on June 26, there could be a selloff after the split is executed. Investors should proceed with caution.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Close up of AMD sign in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nBelieve it or not, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are more expensive currently than archrival Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. AMD stock is trading at a P/E multiple of 247. That compares to 65 times forward earnings estimates for NVDA stock. Of course, Nvidia just reported that its profit rose more than 600% in the first quarter from a year earlier.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has gained the high valuation partly from its own earnings growth, and also because of lofty expectations for the company\u2019s new AI microchips. AMD is seen as the main challenger to Nvidia in the fast-growing market for AI chips and semiconductors, where global demand is exploding. In the last 12 months, the share price of AMD has increased 36%. Through five years, the stock is up 523%.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Robinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of online brokerage Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) have exploded over the last year as a bull market in both stocks and cryptocurrencies has investors trading more. In the past 12 months, HOOD stock has gained 127%, outpacing most other equities. The rocketing share price has pushed Robinhood Markets\u2019 P/E ratio sky-high. It\u2019s at a point where Robinhood stock is trading at 141 times future earnings.\n\nThe pricey valuation comes as investors cheer the brokerage and its financial results. On the back of strong trading activity, Robinhood recently reported record first-quarter financial results. The company singled out crypto trading on its platform as being largely responsible for its strong financial results. Cryptocurrency transaction revenue more than tripled in Q1 from a year earlier. In the last month alone, HOOD stock has risen 17%.\n\nEli Lilly And Co. (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) has a big catalyst with its weight loss drug Zepbound. Robust sales of the weight loss medication have powered Eli Lilly\u2019s sales and stock to new heights in recent months. In the past year, LLY stock has climbed nearly 90% higher. That brings the stock\u2019s five-year appreciation to almost 600%. The sharp rise in the share price has led to a significant increase in the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nCurrently, LLY stock is trading at 118 time earnings estimates. That compares to a P/E ratio of less than 10 for rival Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (NYSE:JNJ) stock. Pharmaceutical stocks are known for having low P/E multiples. This begs the question of whether the valuation of Eli Lilly\u2019s stock is justified? Analysts seem to feel it is given that Zepbound is expected to post sales of more than $1 billion in its first year on the market, and it could become the biggest-selling drug of all time.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO), the leading credit scoring agency in the U.S., has been a consistent, long-term winner for investors. FICO stock has risen 22% this year, 75% over the last 12 months, and 367% in the past five years. The company\u2019s near monopoly on credit scoring services in the U.S. has led to consistently strong earnings growth and a stock that seemingly always rises. But that growth has made Fair Isaac\u2019s stock expensive.\n\nToday, FICO stock is trading at 72 times future earnings estimates. While the Bozeman, Montana-based company has a market capitalization of $34 billion, it is currently trading at a higher multiple than most of the Magnificent 7 mega-cap tech stocks that have market caps above $1 trillion. There\u2019s no question that shareholders pay a premium to own Fair Isaac stock. But the company\u2019s growth and competitive position in the marketplace help account for the rich valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, LLY and FICO.

        "content": "As the restaurant industry continues to face post-pandemic era challenges, investors might want to consider selling a few restaurant stocks while they still can. These companies struggle with various issues such as declining sales, increasing costs and intense competition. Unfortunately, these have negatively impacted their financial performance and stock prices.\n\nInvestors should evaluate these restaurant stocks\u2019 long-term prospects by considering their adaptability to changing consumer preferences. Also, financial health and competitive position are two more factors to examine. If a stock consistently underperforms its peers and broader market without clear signs of a turnaround strategy, investors may want to cut losses and reallocate capital.\n\nWith some great stocks to buy in this industry, it makes little sense for investors to continue to invest in struggling companies. Some of the best names in the industry also pay strong dividends and have stable stock prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let\u2019s explore three restaurant stocks to sell this month that may prove a pain to retain.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been under pressure due to rising food costs and supply chain disruptions. True, the company has a strong brand and customer loyalty. But, its high valuation and the impact of inflation on its operating costs pose significant risks.\n\nThe prices for essential ingredients like avocados, beef and dairy have surged, increasing the company\u2019s overall operating expenses. For instance, the price of avocados has been particularly volatile, affecting the cost of one of Chipotle\u2019s staple ingredients.\n\nFurthermore, analysts have expressed concerns about whether the company can sustain its premium valuation given the external pressures of rising costs and supply chain issues. The high valuation makes Chipotle vulnerable to market corrections.\n\nCMG may not offer investors enough upside potential in order to stay invested. And the persistent inflation risks means margins may continue to feel pressure.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) has seen its growth slowing down after a period of rapid expansion. The company\u2019s focus on delivery and carryout kept it afloat during the pandemic. However, competition is increasing.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, the company reported a 5.9% increase in total revenues, reaching $1.08 billion. Also, it saw a 20.1% rise in net income to $125.8 million. Despite these gains, the growth rate has decelerated compared to previous years\u200b.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe competitive arena in the food delivery and quick-service restaurant sectors has intensified. Domino\u2019s, which relies heavily on delivery and carryout services, faces stiff competition from both traditional pizza chains and new market entrants like third-party delivery services such as Uber Eats and DoorDash.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining high growth rates will be challenging amid increasing operational costs and competitive pressures\u200b. It seems that DPZ will struggle to remain as the cheap go-to option as it fights to maintain its identity in the gig economy and an environment of rapidly rising input costs.\n\nYum! Brands (YUM) The KFC letters on a store's front sign.\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe parent company Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell has been facing declining sales.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, the company\u2019s total revenues decreased by 3% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.59 billion. Also, same-store sales declined by 3%, reflecting the challenges the company faces with growth momentum\u200b.\n\nAdditionally, YUM focuses on digital sales and potential acquisitions to drive growth. The company\u2019s digital sales are projected to reach approximately $30 billion by the end of the year, up from $12 billion four years prior.\n\nYet, analysts have a mixed view of Yum! Brands\u2019 future prospects. Some analysts highlight the company\u2019s potential for a 17% upside due to its strategic initiatives and robust growth outlook. But, others maintain a neutral stance, and the company has what I believe to be overly optimistic EPS and revenue forecasts.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Chipotle Stock a Buy Ahead of Its Stock Split?",
        "content": "Shares of restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) have gone on an incredible run over the past few months. The stock was at a 52-week low of $1,768.64 last October, and since then, zoomed up to a high of $3,260 on May 10.\n\nAdding to the fervor around shares is the company's March 19 announcement of a 50-for-1 stock split, one of the biggest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Shares are expected to begin trading on a post-split basis on June 26.\n\nChipotle stock has dropped from its 52-week high recently. Does this create a buying opportunity ahead of its impending stock split? Let's dig into the company's performance to arrive at an answer.\n\nChipotle's business expansion\n\nThe rise in Chipotle's share price the past few months, and its scheduled stock split, are indicative of investor demand to own a piece of the company. That's understandable given Chipotle's goal to expand its business.\n\nThe firm is working toward a target of 7,000 restaurants in North America. At the end of the first quarter, Chipotle was about halfway toward this goal with 3,479 locations. This means the company has years of business growth ahead.\n\nChipotle is being strategic about its expansion, as demonstrated by its Chipotlanes store format. These are drive-through locations designed for customers to quickly pick up orders placed online.\n\nThe company aims to open at least 285 new locations in 2024, with 80% of them being Chipotlanes. The emphasis on Chipotlanes illustrates a key factor in the firm's success, which is to drive as many customers through its locations as possible.\n\nCEO Brian Niccol explained, \"Our strong sales trends were fueled by our focus on improving throughput in our restaurants.\"\n\nChipotle's revenue growth\n\nAnd Chipotle's sales were indeed strong. In Q1, revenue rose 14% year over year to $2.7 billion. One contributor to this sales growth was the company's addition of 255 new stores since Q1 of last year.\n\nAnother key contributor was rising sales in existing stores, and here, Chipotle saw a 7% year-over-year increase in Q1. Expanding these comparable-store sales is desirable, since it means revenue growth isn't dependent on adding new stores.\n\nChipotle successfully employed technology to drive sales growth as well. It offers a rewards program accessed through its website and mobile app, and uses these channels to market to a base of loyal customers. As a result, digital sales comprised 36.5% of its Q1 food and beverage revenue.\n\nOther factors to consider with Chipotle stock\n\nThe company is not only growing its top line; the bottom line is increasing as well. Q1 net income was $359.3 million, an impressive 23% jump up from the prior year's $291.6 million. This strong growth was helped by improvement in restaurant-level operating margin, which rose from 25.6% in Q1 of 2023 to 27.5% this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese numbers demonstrate Chipotle is a well-run business. It's managing costs while driving revenue growth -- exactly the kind of performance you want to see in a company.\n\nAs a result, Chipotle's been able to achieve incredible earnings per share (EPS) growth. Its Q1 diluted EPS was $13.01, a 24% increase over the prior year's $10.50. Not only that, Chipotle's diluted EPS has consistently eclipsed competitors' over the last several years. CMG EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nThese competitors include restaurant giants McDonald's, Starbucks, and Yum! Brands, which owns multiple fast-food chains such as Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.\n\nChipotle possesses many qualities that make it an attractive investment, but what do Wall Street analysts think? The consensus among them is an overweight rating with a median share price of $3,350 for Chipotle stock. This shows a belief in some upside from the current share price.\n\nWhether you purchase shares before or after the stock split, it doesn't change the value of your investment. After the split, the increase in outstanding shares leads to a proportional decrease in the stock price. For example, if the split occurs at a $3,140 share price, the post-split amount would be $62.80 per share.\n\nChipotle is firing on all cylinders right now. It's expanding restaurant locations, successfully leveraging digital channels, and growing the top and bottom lines. These factors make Chipotle stock a worthwhile long-term investment, whether you buy now or after the stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Better Stock-Split Buy: Nvidia or Chipotle?",
        "content": "Step aside, Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). There's a more heavily anticipated stock split on the way now. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) announced in its first-quarter update last week that it plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split effective June 7, 2024. Chipotle's board of directors approved a 50-for-1 stock split in March that's expected to take effect on June 26, 2024.\n\nNvidia has been the bigger winner by far so far this year. The GPU maker's shares have skyrocketed more than 125% compared to a gain of more than 35% for Chipotle. But which is the better stock-split buy now: Nvidia or Chipotle?\n\nForget about the stock splits\n\nFirst things first: Forget about the stock splits. I know many investors get excited about them and I led off this article talking about them, but they're practically meaningless.\n\nSure, both Nvidia and Chipotle stocks will soon sport lower share prices. And maybe this will entice some retail investors to buy. The reality, though, is that anyone who wanted to invest less the price of one share in Nvidia and Chipotle could have already done so. How? Many online brokers offer the opportunity to buy fractional shares of top stocks.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that stock splits don't always provide nice catalysts for a stock's price. And when they do, the gains are often temporary.\n\nMost importantly, though, stock splits change nothing about a company's underlying business. Stock splits merely increase the number of outstanding shares and lower the price of each share. That's it.\n\nHow Nvidia and Chipotle stack up against each other\n\nNonetheless, the upcoming stock splits for Nvidia and Chipotle could stoke interest in both stocks. How do they stack up against each other? Let's start with each company's financial position.\n\nNvidia reported Q1 revenue of $26 billion, up 262% over the result in the prior-year period. The company posted a profit of nearly $15 billion, soaring 628% year over year. Nvidia's cash stockpile topped $31.4 billion as of April 28.\n\nChipotle's Q1 revenue jumped 14.1% year over year to $2.7 billion. Its earnings rose 13.3% to $359.3 million. The restaurant operator had cash and cash equivalents totaling nearly $727.4 million as of March 31.\n\nMoving on to growth prospects, Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings will grow by nearly 43% annually on average over the next five years. Analysts look for Chipotle's earnings to increase by around 22% annually during the same period.\n\nWhat about valuation? Nvidia's shares trade at a lofty 41.5 times forward earnings estimates. However, the stock's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a more reasonable 1.35. Meanwhile, Chipotle's forward earnings multiple of 58.8 and PEG ratio of 2.72 are even higher than Nvidia's multiples.\n\nStory continues\n\nI doubt that income investors will find either stock appealing. However, Nvidia does offer a dividend whereas Chipotle doesn't. Nvidia also recently announced a 150% increase to its dividend payout.\n\nBetter stock-split buy?\n\nThis decision appears to be an easy one. Nvidia's financials are more impressive than Chipotle's. The giant chipmaker has stronger growth prospects. Its valuation is more attractive. Nvidia even offers a small dividend. It's the hands-down winner, in my view.\n\nJust because Nvidia is a better pick than Chipotle, though, doesn't automatically make it the best stock to buy right now. As great as Nvidia is, I think other stocks could be even bigger winners over the next few years. These stocks might not have stock splits on the way, but that doesn't matter one bit.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "At 67x Earnings, Chipotle Stock (NYSE:CMG) Is a Market Anomaly",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) owns and operates over 3,400 Mexican restaurants across five different countries. Investors have bid up its shares to 67x earnings, touting the company\u2019s growth, drive-throughs, recession-resistant demand, and balance sheet. However, at current interest rates, Chipotle\u2019s valuation is a market anomaly. The yield on government bonds far exceeds Chipotle\u2019s earnings yield, even into the distant future. Therefore, I\u2019m bearish on Chipotle stock.\n\nWhy Chipotle\u2019s Valuation Doesn\u2019t Make Sense\n\nWarren Buffett once said, \u201cInterest rates are to asset prices\u2026 like gravity is to the apple. They power everything in the economic universe.\u201d\n\nSo what did Buffett mean? Well, in finance, there\u2019s something called the \u201crisk-free rate.\u201d The premise is simple: if you can get 5% on a risk-free asset like a U.S. government bond, that should be the minimum required rate of return for a riskier, less certain asset like a stock. Additionally, you should have a \u201crisk premium\u201d that makes up for the extra risk.\n\nOver the past 150 years, the 10-year treasury has yielded an average of approximately 5%, which is slightly above where we are now. In the same time frame, the median S&P 500 P/E ratio was 15x, providing a 6.66% earnings yield plus growth. This resulted in compound annual returns of around 9.2% for the S&P 500 (over 150 years), meaning that the average equity risk premium over that time was about 4.2%.\n\nThe problem is that Chipotle has the opposite of a risk premium, making it look extremely overvalued. For example, on analyst earnings estimates, Chipotle has forward P/E ratios of 57x in 2024, 48x in 2025, 40x in 2026, 33x in 2027, and 28x in 2028. This translates to earnings yields of 1.75%, 2.08%, 2.50%, 3.03%, and 3.57%. These earnings yields are nowhere near the 5.21% you can get on a one-year treasury or the 4.59% you can get on a five-year treasury.\n\nEven if Chipotle lives up to analysts\u2019 lofty growth expectations (and I don\u2019t believe it will) and then trades at a P/E ratio of 30x on its 2028 earnings, you would get a total return of less than 2% per annum, which translates to a negative equity risk premium. This is a market anomaly. But, like Buffett said, gravity should eventually take hold.\n\nIf the market decides to re-rate Chipotle at a lower P/E ratio, say 35x on current earnings (providing a 2.86% earnings yield plus growth), the stock price would fall by nearly 50%. A 35x P/E ratio may seem low now, but it is still significantly above where Starbucks (NYSE:SBUX) and McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) currently trade. Chipotle traded at a P/E ratio of around 25x from 2008-2010, when it had a much larger growth opportunity ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle\u2019s Growth Will Slow\n\nChipotle\u2019s earnings have grown at a blistering pace over the past five years. From 2018 to 2023, the company\u2019s EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 47.7%. This was partially the result of the company improving its return on assets. In other words, Chipotle was underearning back in 2018, with just a 7.79% return on assets.\n\nMeanwhile, companies with similar business models, like McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks, were earning an 18% return on assets in 2018 (more than double the returns at Chipotle). Chipotle\u2019s weak returns from 2016 to 2020 were likely due to foodborne illness problems and legal issues that tarnished its reputation and hurt its bottom line. However, Chipotle\u2019s customers have come back in a big way, and the company has improved returns through its loyalty program, expansion, and drive-throughs.\n\nIf we fast-forward to 2023, Chipotle doubled its return on assets to 15.41%, in line with other owner-operated chains. For example, Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s also have returns on assets in the 14-16% range, which is high versus the industry\u2019s historical average.\n\nAll this means that growth will likely slow at Chipotle. For example, Chipotle\u2019s 10-year average EPS CAGR was much lower at 15.5%. I expect that the company\u2019s growth could be even less than this rate, going forward. Last year, Chipotle grew its restaurant count by just 8%. The company also relies on buybacks, which will be ineffective at 67x earnings. Additionally, there\u2019s the risk that management fails to deliver.\n\nIs CMG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nCurrently, 18 out of 26 analysts covering CMG give it a Buy rating; eight rate it a Hold, and zero analysts rate it a Sell, resulting in a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The\u00a0average Chipotle Mexican Grill stock price target\u00a0is $3,250.58, implying upside potential of 3.1%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $2,700 per share to a high of $3,600 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line on CMG Stock\n\nInterest rates would likely need to move closer to 0% for Chipotle\u2019s valuation to make sense. The stock appears to have a deeply negative equity risk premium. Should Chipotle\u2019s P/E ratio fall from 67x to a more appropriate multiple of 35x on current earnings, the stock could crash by nearly 50%.\n\nMeanwhile, I think Chipotle\u2019s earnings growth rate will slow in the years ahead to be less than its 10-year average of 15.5%. It grew at a blistering pace over the past five years, partially due to its return on assets doubling. Now on par with McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks on this metric (and on the high end historically), I think this tailwind is gone. Further, buybacks are likely to be ineffective at these levels, and the company\u2019s store count grew by just 8% last year.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Many notable stock splits have occurred in recent years, with companies aiming to increase liquidity within shares and erase barriers to entry for potential investors. Now Nvidia and Chipotle Mexican Grill now have joined the stock-split fray.\n\nStock splits give lower share prices, making stock purchases more affordable for a greater number of investors (although it\u2019s worth noting that the rise of fractional share investing has alleviated this issue for some). Of course, important to note stock splits do not affect the company's valuation or financial health.\n\nWhat do the recently announced stock splits for Nvidia NVDA and Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG mean? Let\u2019s take a closer look at how the companies currently stack up and an example of a recent split among a retail heavyweight.\n\nNvidia Announces 10-for-1 Stock Split\n\nNvidia yet again blew away quarterly expectations in its quarterly print, with unrelenting demand for AI chips driving robust performance. Earnings and revenue grew 460% and 260%, respectively, whereas Data Center sales melted 430% higher from the same period last year.\n\nShares soared following the release, with the company enjoying post-earnings positivity all throughout 2024. In addition to a 10-for-1 split, the company also announced a 150% boost to its quarterly dividend payout, reflecting a shareholder-friendly nature. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNvidia\u2019s earnings outlook only continues to get brighter, with the stock remaining a highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares represent a prime opportunity for any investor seeking AI exposure, with demand expected to remain strong.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the bullish revisions trend for its current fiscal year. Shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 10. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Shares Rise 13% on Split News\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican restaurant chains. It\u2019s the first split in the company\u2019s history, aiming to make shares more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors. Shares are expected to begin trading on a post-split basis on June 26.\n\nThe company\u2019s sales growth has been spectacular, with CMG posting double-digit percentage revenue growth rates in each of its last 15 quarterly releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSince the split announcement, shares have gained nearly 13% compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 3% gain. Impressively, CMG shares have delivered a 36% annualized return over the last five years. As shown by the green arrow, performance has been aided by quarterly releases.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow did Walmart Stock Split Perform?\n\nRetail giant Walmart WMT recently underwent a 3-for-1 split, with shares trading on a split-adjusted basis starting on February 26. Like Nvidia, analysts have become bullish on the company\u2019s outlook, with the stock sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nAs shown in the below chart, shares gained 8% in value during the period in which the split was announced (Jan. 30) to the actual split date (Feb. 26). It\u2019s worth noting that quarterly results also partly boosted share performance, similar to CMG. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile stock splits don\u2019t affect a company's fundamentals, they can positively influence investor perception, leading to increased demand and higher liquidity within shares.\n\nAnd with the recent announcements we\u2019ve received from Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG and Nvidia NVDA, splits have jumped back into the headlines.\n\nStill, the announcement of a split doesn\u2019t reflect an immediate buy signal, as investors focused on the near term should instead focus on earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIn addition, it's worth noting positive price action generally leads into the split, with Walmart WMT shares not seeing a boost on its actual split date.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Growth Stock Gut Check: 7 Stocks to Sell as Valuations Veer Into the Stratosphere",
        "content": "How long will the run in growth stocks continue? The Nasdaq-100 continues to make new all-time highs seemingly almost every week. Every dip, no matter how brief, is instantly bought up as traders pile in to profit from further bullish momentum.\n\nBut trees don\u2019t grow to the sky. At some point, the rally will end. And with the Nasdaq up more than 70% from the 2022 lows, valuations are becoming increasingly untethered from these companies\u2019 underlying fundamentals.\n\nAs metrics such as price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) head to ever-loftier heights for leading growth stocks, traders should be taking a wary look toward the exits. At some point the momentum will reverse, and the ensuing selling could be swift. These are seven especially risky growth stocks to sell now while prices are still favorable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) is the worldwide leader in streaming music. While streaming audio is a highly competitive market in North America, in emerging markets such as Latin America, Spotify has taken a dominant position in music streaming.\n\nThis led many investors, myself included, to think that Spotify could exhibit monopoly-like characteristics. In turn, this would allow Spotify to raise prices, hammer out better contracts with the record labels and greatly improve profit margins.\n\nI was a longtime investor in SPOT stock, but I sold my position and am now bearish simply because that thesis didn\u2019t play out whatsoever.\n\nSpecifically, in 2018, Spotify generated a gross profit margin of 25.7%. In 2023, its gross profit margin fell to 25.6%. Despite adding hundreds of millions of users, investing heavily in content like podcasts and building its brand dramatically, Spotify wasn\u2019t able to use that to improve the business\u2019 economics whatsoever.\n\nThat is reflected on the bottom line as well. Spotify generated a net loss of $89 million in 2018. This ballooned to a loss of $580 million in 2023. The company has yet to generate a GAAP profit on a full-year basis. While Spotify stock has more than doubled over the past year, its underlying business economics are as fuzzy as ever.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) shares sold off sharply following a recent downbeat earnings report. Despite that, however, DUOL stock is still up dramatically in the bigger picture with shares rallying approximately 150% since the start of 2023.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Duolingo has brought a fresh and innovative approach to the language-learning arena. I live abroad and have met many fellow expats that have had positive experiences with Duolingo to help jumpstart their studies. That said, a good app isn\u2019t necessarily a great business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is still trading at 12x enterprise value to sales, and shares are going for more than 100x forward earnings. That\u2019s quite expensive, especially as AI translation apps and tools threaten to limit the total addressable market for Duolingo\u2019s services.\n\nFurthermore, the free version of Duolingo\u2019s flagship application is quite powerful, making monetization a tricky challenge as many users see no reason to upgrade. Things such as\u00a0English testing certifications are interesting and could work over time, but the company will need to do more to demonstrate success.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\n25 years ago,\u00a0Dell (NYSE:DELL) was a popular investment as it was at the forefront of major trends in consumer electronics hardware.\n\nThat\u2019s no longer the case. In 2024, Dell is primarily known for being a staid IT vendor. Its business is consistent but rarely grows much, and Wall Street usually assigns it a low valuation.\n\nBut all Dell had to do was sprinkle in a touch of AI and the whole narrative has flipped. Now people have forgotten that Dell\u2019s core business is a slow-moving one, as traders latch onto DELL as a hidden AI pick. DELL stock is now up 250% over the past 12 months and its valuation multiples are rising.\n\nMake no mistake, Dell is selling some AI enabled servers and hardware. That\u2019s certainly useful to some extent. But reselling the latest generation of hardware is a much different position within the AI space than being the innovator creating the underlying technology. Morningstar analyst William Kerwin sees more than\u00a060% downside for DELL stock from current levels as the hype wears off, with a fair value target of just $55 compared to today\u2019s $160 price.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco logo on a sign on a Costco store.\n\nSource: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) is probably not the first name people think of as a growth stock. However, the club store operator is in the Nasdaq index, and it\u2019s also certainly trading like a growth stock.\n\nWith shares at fresh all-time highs, Costco is now trading for more than 50 times earnings. That\u2019s the highest valuation COST stock has achieved in decades. It\u2019s one thing for a small start-up with a tiny revenue base to trade for 50 times earnings; it\u2019s quite another for a dominant retailer that already has a fairly saturated store base.\n\nCostco has grown earnings per share at an 11.8% annualized clip over the past decade. That\u2019s impressive stuff. But is it worthy of a 50x P/E ratio? Probably not.\n\nParticularly if the economy starts to roll over, Costco could be vulnerable to dramatic downside. If COST stock returned to a 30x P/E ratio \u2014 hardly a fire sale price \u2014 that would imply 40% downside on the stock from here. And if earnings dropped as well during a recession, losses could be even greater.\n\nCostco is a great business. But it\u2019s priced for perfection right now and any sort of economic or operational hiccup could be devastating.\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava Group (NYSE:CAVA) is a recent initial public offering (IPO) that has become one of the hottest growth stocks in the restaurant space. The expectation is that Cava will become the Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) of Mediterranean food.\n\nAnd at this price, it had better achieve that goal, otherwise shareholders will be left with indigestion.\n\nSpecifically, CAVA is trading at 13x revenues, 150x EBITDA, and more than 300x forward earnings. The thinking is that Cava will open far more stores around the country and grow into its valuation over time. But it\u2019s far from assured that the same Cava menu that is so popular in major tier-1 urban areas will play as well in other parts of America.\n\nThe fast casual market dining market is far more competitive than it used to be. And inflation and economic strain are putting pressure on consumers. If Cava becomes the next Panera or Chipotle, shareholders could still make money even from today\u2019s lofty valuation. But the more likely outcome is that Cava will see growth slow at some point \u2014 such as during a recession \u2014 and its share price will dramatically deflate.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) A magnifying glass zooms in on the logo for Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the global leaders in the memory category of semiconductor firms.\n\nThe memory market is known for its dramatic boom/bust cycle. The memory market used to be highly competitive with more than a dozen rivals. Over time this consolidated down to a few major players, and analysts hoped that memory firms could enjoy steady consistent profitability.\n\nBut rumors of the cycle\u2019s demise\u00a0were overblown. As it would turn out, as soon as computer and smartphone demand rolled over in 2023, so did Micron\u2019s business. The company lost a prodigious sum of money in 2023.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to return to at least breakeven results this year. But times are hardly good for Micron, with shares still trading for more than 150x forward earnings. Traders have latched onto AI as a catalyst for Micron, but its AI solutions are a fractional revenue line within its larger business.\n\nMorningstar\u2019s William Kerwin agrees that MU stock is wildly overvalued. He believes shares are worth just $80 today, implying that the stock has 38% downside from here. Kerwin gives MU stock a 1-star rating and warns that the company has no competitive moat and faces dramatic risks from its exposure to the Chinese market.\n\nAppLovin (APP) The AppLovin (APP) info on an iPhone and laptop screen.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) is a software company which develops and operates a mobile marketing platform and ecosystem. It offers products such as AppDiscovery, MAX and SparkLabs.\n\nAppLovin, as the name might suggest, primarily helps mobile application developers to monetize their programs, and further boost their marketing and consumer engagement efforts.\n\nAPP stock has gone on an absolute tear over the past year with the shares rising more than 230%.\n\nInvestors are pleased that AppLovin has been able to work around some of the\u00a0privacy restrictions that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other operators have put in their ecosystems. AppLovin is certainly making progress as a business and its AI ad system is also sparking investor enthusiasm.\n\nWhile AppLovin is enjoying a large increase in revenues in 2024, analysts believe this is a temporary development tied to solving particular pain points such as Apple\u2019s privacy moves. Once the current revenue growth spurt ends, analysts see revenue growth dropping to just 12% for FY\u2019 25 and 11% for FY \u201926. Traders are currently extrapolating AppLovin\u2019s strong earnings results into the indefinite future, but APP stock could be in for a rude awakening once growth inevitably slows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Are Strong Financial Prospects The Force That Is Driving The Momentum In Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.'s NYSE:CMG) Stock?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE:CMG) stock is up by a considerable 19% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Chipotle Mexican Grill's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Chipotle Mexican Grill is:\n\n39% = US$1.3b \u00f7 US$3.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.39.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's Earnings Growth And 39% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Chipotle Mexican Grill has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 18% which is quite remarkable. So, the substantial 35% net income growth seen by Chipotle Mexican Grill over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nWe then compared Chipotle Mexican Grill's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 26% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Chipotle Mexican Grill is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Chipotle Mexican Grill Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Chipotle Mexican Grill's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

        "title": "The Chipotle Walkout Method: What Does This Mean for the Stock?",
        "content": "In early May, TikTok food influencer Keith Lee posted a review of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). The creator, who boasts more than 16 million subscribers, called the restaurant's portions \"crazy\" and rated its chicken al-pastor and rice bowl a 2 out of 10.\n\nHis remarks may have helped start a trend called the \"walkout method,\" where customers simply leave Chipotle restaurants mid-order if they aren't satisfied with how much food they are getting. What could this mean for the company and its stock price? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nBusiness is booming\n\nWhile some Chipotle's customers seem dissatisfied with the restaurant online, real-life spending habits tell a different story. Chipotle's fourth-quarter sales grew 14.1% year over year to $2.7 billion, driven by a healthy 7% jump in comparable restaurant sales. And this is despite a whopping four price increases in the last two years.\n\nChipotle's profitabilityalso remains strong, with net income growing by 26% to $282 million in the period (a margin of 11.2%).  CMG Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nWhen it comes to food pricing, Chipotle doesn't have much incentive to change what it's doing unless customers change their buying behavior. And that doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon.\n\nThe issue of portion sizes is a little more complicated. Food, beverage, and packaging represented around 29% of Chipotle's first-quarter operating costs, down from 32% this time in 2019.\n\nThe decline suggests management could be taking steps to save money on the food side of the business. This could be through tactics like smaller portions -- or it could mean the company is benefiting from improving economies of scale, a changing product mix, or many other factors. It is difficult to know for sure. But whatever is happening, it likely starts from the top. Unlike McDonald's or other franchise-based fast food restaurants, Chipotle owns and operates all its stores, giving it a high level of control over policies like portion sizes and pricing.\n\nDemand-pull inflation\n\nWith inflation soaring in the post-pandemic period, so-called \"corporate greed\" has become the easy scapegoat for persistently high consumer prices, even as production costs start to moderate. However, this narrative reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of economics. Well-run businesses and individuals will always seek to maximize their income.\n\nYou wouldn't take a job for $20 per hour if you could earn $30 for the same work. Big corporations like Chipotle are no different.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe problem is not corporate greed. It'sdemand-pull inflation, which occurs when demand for goods and services is too high relative to supply, often because of government or Fed stimulus.This allows companies to increase their equilibrium pricing. And it is a normal part of running a successful business. It also swings the opposite way when low demand or recession causes companies to lower their equilibrium price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is an issue of branding\n\nIt is unclear how much longer fast food demand will remain elevated in the face of rising prices and anecdotally smaller portion sizes. However, Chipotle currently faces limited threats to its revenue growth and margins. Despite the online complaints, consumers are still scrambling to buy what Chipotle is selling -- as evidenced by the company's soaring same-store revenue growth over the last few quarters.\n\nThat being said, Chipotle could face significant brand and reputational damage if it doesn't get this portion-size controversy under control. And that is not good news for shareholders.\n\nWhile no competent economist would fault management for raising prices to meet healthy demand, lowering portion sizes in tandem seems to be a bridge too far, especially when customers have developed an expectation of how much food they should be receiving. It's hard to imagine that a couple of dollars saved on rice and beans is worth potentially alienating the customers who helped make Chipotle's success possible.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Meet Wall Street's Newest Stock-Split Stock -- a Company on the Cutting Edge of the Hottest Innovation",
        "content": "Though Wall Street is firmly entrenched in a bull market right now, it's been nothing short of a wild ride for investors since this decade began. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite were whipsawed between bear and bull markets in successive years from 2020 through 2023.\n\nWhen uncertainty is a prevailing theme on Wall Street, it's not uncommon for investors of all walks to seek out the safety of industry-leading businesses that have handily outperformed the major stock indexes. For years, this had involved investors flocking to the \"FAANG stocks.\" But over the last three years, it's companies enacting stock splits that investors can't stop buying. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors have gravitated to stocks conducting splits\n\nA \"stock split\" allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter both its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. I use the word \"cosmetic\" to make clear that stock splits have no effect on an underlying company's market cap or operating performance.\n\nStock splits come in two varieties: forward and reverse. A forward-stock split is designed to make a company's shares more nominally affordable for investors who might not be able to purchase fractional shares through their online broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase the share price of a publicly traded company to ensure its continued listing on a major stock exchange.\n\nWhile there have been a handful of stocks throughout the years that have gone on to be wildly successful following a reverse split, most investors are rightly chasing after companies conducting forward-stock splits. Businesses enacting forward splits are often out-innovating their competition and have outperformed the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, roughly a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a forward-stock split, including FAANG components Amazon and Alphabet. Through less than five months of 2024, four new juggernauts have joined this elite club.\n\nWall Street's \"Class of 2024\" stock-split stocks\n\nStock-split announcements kicked off in late January when retail kingpin Walmart(NYSE: WMT) unveiled plans to conduct a 3-for-1 forward split. Although Walmart's share price wasn't absurdly high at the time (around $165), the company's management team wanted to ensure that its associates would be able to purchase whole shares if they chose to participate in the Associate Stock Purchase Plan.\n\nWalmart began trading at its split-adjusted price on February 26, which is also the day S&P Dow Jones Indices made a few changes to the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average. Given Walmart's ability to use its size to its advantage in order to undercut its competition on price, this is unlikely to be the company's last stock split.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext up was fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG), whose share price was near $3,000 when, in March, it announced its intent to conduct a 50-for-1 forward split in late June. Like Walmart, Chipotle's management team wants to split its stock to make it more accessible to its team members.\n\nShares of Chipotle have skyrocketed more than 14,200% since its January 2006 initial public offering price of $22. In addition to providing fresher foods that consumers have clearly shown they'll pay a premium for, Chipotle has benefited immensely by keeping its menu compact. A smaller menu helps its staff quickly prepare meals.\n\nAfter Chipotle came Sony Group(NYSE: SONY). The Japan-based consumer electronics company announced a 5-for-1 stock split on May 14, with an effective date for the company's American depositary receipts (ADRs) of October 8. This is Sony's first stock split in 24 years.\n\nDespite slower sales of Sony's PlayStation 5 gaming console, which debuted in late 2020, the company has enjoyed solid sales growth from its PlayStation Plus subscription service, which allows gamers to save their data in the cloud and play multiplayer games with their friends. Sales of the company's image sensors, which are used in next-generation smartphones, have been strong, too.\n\nNow, Wall Street has a fourth stock-split stock of 2024, and it's a familiar name: artificial intelligence (AI) kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nSay hello to Wall Street's newest stock-split stock\n\nInterestingly enough, Nvidia is one of the roughly \"dozen high-profile companies\" I alluded to earlier that have increased investors' fascination with stock-split stocks since the midpoint of 2021.\n\nFollowing the closing bell on May 22, Nvidia released its operating results for the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28) and announced a 10-for-1 forward split that'll become effective before trading begins on June 10. This marks the sixth split since Nvidia became a public company, and its first since July 2021, when it completed a 4-for-1 split.\n\nAs has become the norm over the last 18 months, Nvidia mud-stomped Wall Street's consensus sales and profit expectations for the April-ended quarter. Net sales more than tripled to $26 billion from the prior-year period, with Data Center revenue surging 427% from what was reported in the comparable quarter in fiscal 2024.\n\nThe catalyst for Nvidia is undeniably AI. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are what fuel the split-second decision-making needed in high-compute data centers handling generative AI solutions and training large language models. It's been estimated that Nvidia's chips account for around 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nNvidia has also been a prime beneficiary of demand absolutely swamping supply. Even with top chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing meaningfully increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity -- high-bandwidth memory is packaged on CoWoS and is a veritable necessity for AI-accelerated data centers -- Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting AI-GPU demand. As a result, it's enjoyed otherworldly pricing power for its chips and increased its gross margin to north of 78%.\n\nBased solely on Nvidia's operating results over the last year and change, the company appears unstoppable.\n\nBut looks can be deceiving. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHistory is going to catch up with Nvidia sooner than later\n\nWhile it's difficult to find a flaw in Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter operating results, the company's guidance and history provide clues that suggest this stock-split stock could be knocked off of its pedestal sooner than later.\n\nOne of the more glaring concerns for Nvidia is how next-big-thing innovation trends have fared over the last three decades.\n\nBeginning with the advent of the internet, every next-big-thing innovation has navigated its way through an early innings bubble precipitated by lofty investor expectations. In simpler terms, investors have a terrible habit of overestimating how quickly a new technology, innovation, or trend will be adopted. History suggests it's highly unlikely for artificial intelligence to be the exception to this unwritten rule. While Nvidia's GPUs can still be wildly successful over the long run, the company's stock maintaining its nearly parabolic move higher probably isn't in the cards.\n\nNvidia's fiscal second-quarter guidance also raised a red flag that likely flew over the heads of most investors. During the first quarter, Nvidia's gross margin (net sales less cost of revenue) tipped the scales at 78.4%. But for the second quarter, Nvidia is forecasting an adjusted gross margin of 75.5%, give or take 50 basis points.\n\nThis forecast retracement in gross margin of close to three percentage points is likely the result of two factors. First, Nvidia is starting to contend with its first real bout of external competition. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are both rolling out their respective H100 GPU rivals. Even if Nvidia's chips are preferred in data centers, the mere presence of these external competitors will lessen AI-GPU scarcity and almost certainly weaken Nvidia's pricing power.\n\nThe other probable issue is competition from within. Nvidia's top customers include Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet. Together, these four companies account for about 40% of its net sales. The problem is that all four are developing AI-GPUs of their own for their data centers. More than likely, this is the peak quarter for Nvidia's gross margin.\n\nWhile stock-split stocks are expected to remain all the rage on Wall Street, they're not all worth investing in.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks Billionaires Are Buying Hand Over Fist, and 1 They've Sent to the Chopping Block",
        "content": "If you're putting your money to work on Wall Street, volatility is something you'll have to get used to. Prior to 2024, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth stock-powered Nasdaq Composite traded off bear and bull markets for four consecutive years.\n\nWhen the going gets tough on Wall Street, professional and retail investors generally seek out the safety of industry-leading companies and perennial outperformers. While the FAANG stocks are a good example, investors have wisely gravitated to companies enacting stock splits over the last three years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock-split stocks take center stage\n\nA stock split is a cosmetic event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. I say \"cosmetic\" because stock splits have no impact on a company's market cap or operating performance.\n\nStock splits take two forms: forward splits and reverse splits. A forward stock split involves reducing a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Meanwhile, reverse stock splits are designed to increase a public company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange.\n\nMost investors tend to pile into companies enacting forward splits -- and for good reason. These companies are typically firing on all cylinders from an operating standpoint and have handily out-innovated their competition. In many instances, companies undertaking forward stock splits have well-defined competitive advantages.\n\nHowever, Wall Street's billionaire money managers have mixed views on what to expect from the 2024 class of stock-split stocks. Following the release of Form 13F filings, which details buying activity for institutional money managers during the first quarter, we can see that billionaires were eager to add to two stock-split stocks while heading to the exit with another.\n\nStock-split stock No. 1 that billionaire investors are buying hand over fist: Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe first stock-split stock billionaires were happy to add to their respective funds during the March-ended quarter is fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). In March, Chipotle announced plans to conduct a 50-for-1 split that'll take effect before the opening bell on June 26, assuming it gets the green light from shareholders at the company's upcoming annual meeting.\n\nDuring the first quarter, Chipotle had four billionaires who were enthusiastic buyers, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nStory continues\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (135,356 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (20,163 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (9,381 shares)\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill has proved to be practically unstoppable since its January 2006 initial public offering. Just as grocery stores beefed up their margins by offering healthier and organic food options, Chipotle's management team quickly realized that consumers would pay a premium for higher-quality food. Chipotle has shunned freezers, uses only responsibly raised meats, and sources its vegetables locally when possible.\n\nArguably, even more important has been Chipotle's decision to limit the size of its menu. Keeping its menu rather small ensures that its staff can quickly prepare meals and keep in-store and drive-thru lines moving. A smaller menu also allows for more buzz when Chipotle introduces a new item.\n\nChipotle's innovation beyond the grill also deserves plenty of credit. Roughly six years ago, the company began introducing dedicated mobile-ordering drive-thru lanes, known as \"Chipotlanes,\" at a few of its locations. The idea has since taken off. Chipotlanes were especially helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic and are responsible for creating an entirely new revenue stream for the company.\n\nDespite trading at a nosebleed premium, shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill remain on the menu for select billionaire investors.\n\nStock-split stock No. 2 that billionaire money managers are buying hand over fist: Sony Group\n\nThe other stock-split stock prominent billionaire investors were gobbling up shares of during the March-ended quarter is Japan-based consumer electronics company Sony Group(NYSE: SONY). To be fair, Sony didn't announce its 5-for-1 forward split until well after the first quarter came to a close. The first split for Sony in 24 years is expected to take effect on Oct. 8 for shares listed in the U.S.\n\nAlthough foreign-based businesses rarely garner as much interest from billionaire investors as U.S.-based companies, two billionaire asset managers were big buyers of Sony stock in the first quarter (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (457,754 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (104,859 shares)\n\nFisher's purchase brought his fund's stake to more than 6.8 million shares of Sony. Meanwhile, Yass has increased Susquehanna's stake in the company by 829% since Dec. 31, 2023!\n\nIf you're wondering why the dynamic duo of Ken Fisher and Jeff Yass are so bullish on Sony, look no further than its higher-margin operating segments. Although PlayStation 5 console demand has waned a bit since being introduced in November 2020, PlayStation Plus revenue is ticking up. PlayStation Plus is a service that allows friends to play multiplayer games and gives gamers access to the cloud, where their gaming data can be stored. This high-margin service, which has multiple tiers, can be paid for monthly or annually.\n\nAdditionally, Sony is one of the world's leading providers of image sensors used in smartphones. The 5G revolution gave consumers and businesses every reason to trade in their devices for models that can take advantage of faster download speeds. With smartphone sales expected to grow in 2024, Sony's imaging and sensing solution sales should keep climbing.\n\nDon't overlook Sony's recently announced share repurchase program, either. If the company maximizes its buyback program, it could retire close to 2.5% of its outstanding shares and provide a modest boost to its earnings per share (EPS). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe stock-split stock billionaires sent to the chopping block: Walmart\n\nHowever, not all stock-split stocks were on the shopping list for billionaire money managers during the March-ended quarter. Retail titan Walmart(NYSE: WMT), which completed a 3-for-1 stock split on Feb. 26, had four top-notch billionaires show it to the door, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (3,201,374 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,540,745 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,152,746 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (745,275 shares)\n\nOne possible reason billionaires headed for the exit from Walmart during the first quarter is the likelihood that the U.S. economy will dip into a recession in the quarters to come. Though economic data remains relatively strong, a historic drop-off in the M2 money supply suggests trouble lies ahead. Retailers like Walmart could struggle if consumers hang on to more of their disposable income.\n\nAnother potential concern is Walmart's valuation. As of the closing bell on May 17, shares were trading at nearly 25 times the consensus EPS for 2025. This represents about a 6% premium to Walmart's average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period. To boot, the stock market is historically pricey and potentially due for a sizable pullback.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Walmart continues to move its profit needle in the right direction by using size to its advantage. Buying products in bulk and undercutting local stores and grocery chains on price has been a winning formula for driving traffic into its stores for decades.\n\nNevertheless, Walmart is probably going to need a big uptick in high-margin Walmart+ membership purchases if it has any hope of sustaining a forward-earnings multiple of 25 over the short run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, you have to invest in the right stocks to increase your chances of success.\n\nCorporations with rising revenue and profit margins look promising. These companies also need to have competitive advantages and plenty of runway in addition to having strong financials. These three stocks to buy exhibit those characteristics and can bring your portfolio higher.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis stock has delivered generational wealth for its long-term investors. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up by more than 2,700% over the past five years and has more than doubled year-to-date.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia\u2019s Blackwell platform is leading the AI boom and has poised the company for the next wave of growth. The company\u2019s innovative AI technology resulted in 262% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 FY25. Profit margins also improved based on the firm\u2019s 628% year-over-year net income growth.\n\nNvidia also stirred up excitement with its 10-for-1 stock split. While stock splits do not make a company more valuable, this stock split has a few benefits that can further push up the stock price. The first advantage is that a lower stock price can increase the likelihood of Nvidia getting added to the Dow Jones Index.\n\nThe second perk is that a lower price per share should stimulate options trading. Options can increase the volatility of the underlying asset and lead to more gains if the majority of options traders buy calls. Given Nvidia\u2019s historical gains and strong financial performance, it\u2019s likely that NVDA calls outpace its put options.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) delivered an exceptional earnings report as other beauty brands warned about slower sales growth. The company had its first fiscal year of more than $1 billion in net sales which was a 77% year-over-year increase. Q4 FY24 revenue was up by 71% year-over-year and came to $321.1 million. Net income was down by roughly 12 year-over-year and came to $14.5 million.\n\nElf Beauty\u2019s guidance implies a net sales increase of 20% to 22% year-over-year in fiscal 2025. This lower guidance initially scared away investors, but Elf Beauty has a history of significantly outperforming its benchmarks and raising its full-year guidance. Elf Beauty raised its guidance in the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe cosmetics company forecasted a 22%-24% year-over-year revenue increase for fiscal 2024. Leadership has regularly issued modest guidance so it can easily beat and raise its benchmarks. That\u2019s why shares rocketed up by 15% upon the earnings release. While guidance looks discouraging, Elf Beauty followed the same script in 2024. The company forecasted 22%-24% growth and ended up with 77% year-over-year net sales growth instead.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a top fast food restaurant that offers healthier choices than most of its competitors. This dynamic has allowed Chipotle to raise its prices multiple times without losing traction. While other fast food restaurants have lost demand due to price fatigue, Chipotle\u2019s earnings report told a different story.\n\nQ1 2024 revenue increased for the Mexican restaurant chain by 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion. Diluted EPS increased by 23.9% year-over-year to reach $13.01 per share.\u00a0 Chipotle also opened 47 new restaurants and remains on track to open 285-315 new restaurants this year.\n\nChipotle has a long-term goal of more than doubling its domestic business and expanding internationally. Those ambitions combined with a quality experience suggest the stock can rally for several years. So far, Chipotle is living up to the hype. Shares are up by 40% year-to-date and have surged by 373% over the past five years. A recently announced stock split should spur additional demand for the stock.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA and ELF.

In announcing the stock split, which will bring the share price down to about $100 a share, the company said that the lower price will make it \u201cmore accessible to employees and investors.\u201d Similarly, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has announced a 50-for-1 stock split after its share price crested above $3,000. Investors often want to avoid the obstacle of shares being too expensive to purchase which is why they hunt for under $50 stocks.\n\nThe high price of a stock can prove to be a barrier to entry for many investors who may not have a lot of capital but want to grow their money nonetheless. The good news is there are plenty of stocks that can be purchased for less than $50. For investors looking to start small, buying shares of great companies at affordable prices is often the best course of action. Here are three under $50 stocks to buy in May 2024.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) 2024 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup truck at the New York Auto Show. GM stock.\n\nSource: quiggyt4 / Shutterstock.com\n\nDetroit automaker General Motors\u2019 (NYSE:GM) stock is on an upswing. Year-to-date (YTD), GM stock has risen 22%. That brings its 12 month gain to 37%. Despite the rise, investors can still buy shares of General Motors for around $44 each. The stock has been marching higher ever since GM raised its 2024 guidance after beating Wall Street expectations across the board with its first-quarter earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors reported Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.62 versus $2.15 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $43.01 billion compared to $41.92 billion that was estimated. Sales rose 7.6% from a year earlier.\n\nOwing to the strong print, GM raised its guidance, saying it expects earnings of $9 to $10 a share, up from a previous range of $8.50 to $9.50 a share. Strong North American sales, particularly of pick-up trucks, is largely responsible for the growth at GM.\n\nCanada Goose Holdings (GOOS) canada goose (goos) logo on the sleeve of a jacket\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nCanada Goose Holdings (NYSE:GOOS) has seen a big earnings turnaround. The maker of winter parkas saw its stock jump 16% higher after it beat analyst expectations for its financial results. The company beat Wall Street forecasts across the board as its sales recovered in the key markets of China and the U.S. following months of declines. Canada Goose reported EPS of 19 cents CAD versus 7 cents CAD that was forecast among analysts. Revenue totaled $358 million CAD, beating Wall Street expectations of $315.5 million CAD.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe luxury parka maker\u2019s revenue in the entire Asia-Pacific region rose 29.6% in the quarter. In North America, sales grew 24.5% over the previous year after a 14% decline in the previous quarter. Management singled out China as a bright spot, noting that luxury brands are making a comeback in the nation of 1.4 billion people. The strong results come after Canada Goose announced in March of this year that it plans to cut 17% of its global workforce amid a prolonged slowdown in sales of luxury items.\n\nGOOS stock is now up 23% this year, though its shares can be bought for only $14.22 each.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a fast growing tech stock that can be purchased for less than $50, look to Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR).

The data analytics company continues to post strong financial results that show continued profitability. For Q1 of this year, Palantir announced EPS of 8 cents, matching Wall Street expectations. The company has posted a profit for six consecutive quarters.\n\nRevenue in Q1 totaled $634 million versus estimates of $625 million. Sales were up 21% from a year ago.

        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). Shares have added about 0.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Chipotle due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nChipotle Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates, Rise Y/Y\n\nChipotle released first-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, the company reported benefits from enhanced throughput and effective marketing initiatives like Braised Beef Barbacoa and Chicken Al Pastor, leading to strong sales and transaction growth. The company stated that the momentum continued into April.\n\nQ1 Earnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nIn the quarter under review, Chipotle reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $13.37, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.63. The bottom line increased 27.3% from $10.50 reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nQuarterly revenues of $2.7 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $2.68 billion by 1%. The top line rose 14.1% on a year-over-year basis on the back of strong comparable restaurant sales growth and new restaurant openings. In the reported quarter, Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants with 43 locations, including a Chipotlane and reported solid performances in terms of new restaurant sales, margins and returns.\r\n\r\nDigital sales contributed 36.5% to total food and beverage revenues.\r\n\r\nComparable restaurant sales rose 7% year over year compared with 8.4% growth reported in the previous quarter. Our estimate was pegged at 4.7%.\n\nCosts, Operating Highlights & Net Income\n\nDuring first-quarter 2024, food, beverage and packaging costs, as a percentage of revenues, came in at 28.8%, down 40 basis points year over year. The upside can be primarily attributed to menu price increases implemented since October 2023. This was partially offset by beef and produce inflation and a challenge in the protein mix resulting from the Braised Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative. We suggested the metric to be 29.2%.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter under discussion, the restaurant-level operating margin reached 27.5%, up from 25.6% a year ago. The uptick was driven by the benefit of sales leverage, partly mitigated by wage and ingredient inflation. We predicted the metric to be 25.5%.\r\n\r\nAdjusted net income in the reported quarter amounted to $369.3 million, up 26.6% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $308.2 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $727.4 million compared with $560.6 million as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, inventory totaled $37.9 million compared with $39.3 million as of Dec 31, 2023.

        "content": "For many, the main point of investing in the stock market is to achieve spectacular returns. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. Don't believe it? Then look at the Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) share price. It's 363% higher than it was five years ago. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. On top of that, the share price is up 19% in about a quarter.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nView our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nOver half a decade, Chipotle Mexican Grill managed to grow its earnings per share at 45% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 36% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 66.49, the market remains optimistic.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Chipotle Mexican Grill shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 52% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 36% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Chipotle Mexican Grill better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill  you should know about.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find lesser know companies this freelist of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Moving on, full year guidance for comparable store sales was raised from mid-single digit year on year percentage increase to mid to high-single digit percentage increase.\n\n\"We had another outstanding quarter driven by our improvement in throughput and successful marketing initiatives, including Braised Beef Barbacoa and Chicken Al Pastor, which drove strong sales and transactions. The results we are seeing from our focus on developing exceptional people, preparing delicious food and fast throughput gives me confidence that we can achieve our long-term target of more than doubling our business in North America and expanding internationally,\" said Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, Chipotle.

        "title": "Nvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement",
        "content": "Alongside its latest earnings results, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10:1 stock split and a 150% dividend raise following the market closed on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia shares, now the ninth most expensive in the S&P 500, opened above $1,000 a day after the print. A 10:1 split would imply a $100/share price, all else being equal, after trading opens on Monday, June 10th.\n\nThis year, eight companies announced stock splits, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in January and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) in March. The surge in Big Tech share prices prompted four splits among the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 mega-cap stocks since 2022, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) making shares more accessible. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) split in 2020, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are nearing the $500/share threshold.\n\n\u201cS&P 500 stocks with share prices over $500 represent $7.4tn in market cap, or about 16% of the index,\u201d Bank of America analysts said in a Thursday note.\n\nIn their recently updated research, BofA found that stock splits are typically bullish for companies that enact them. On average, returns one year post-split are 25%, compared to around 12% for the broader market.\n\n\u201cSplits seem to be bullish across market regimes, something management teams might consider if shares look too expensive for buybacks,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\nWhen comparing the distribution of stock split returns relative to the S&P 500, it can be seen that a few strong companies often improve average performance. For instance, Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) gained 56% in the 12 months following its October 2022 split announcement, while Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) rose 39% after declaring its split in August 2022, BofA highlighted.\n\nGiven that gains are more common and typically larger than losses, stock splits appear to introduce upside potential into markets. For example, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Valero experienced strong performance after their split announcements, regardless of their prior trading behavior.\n\nHowever, outperformance is not guaranteed, BofA\u2019s team cautions. Roughly 30% of stocks see negative returns 12 months post-split, with an average decline of 22%. While splits may indicate strong momentum, companies can still struggle in a challenging macro environment.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked. Amazon is a good example of how stocks can recover, however, and was up 26% in the 24 months after its split announcement,\u201d the firm noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrent NVDA shareholders will receive 10 shares for every share they own today, while the market capitalization of the AI giant will remain unchanged.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement\n\nExclusive-KKR set for unconditional EU antitrust okay for Telecom Italia deal, sources say\n\nWorkday shares dive 12% on lowered subscription revenue outlook\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Chipotle Stock (NYSE:CMG) Can Hit $3,500 Soon",
        "content": "Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) has sustained an incredible rally year-to-date, with its stock advancing by roughly 38% to $3,162 during this period. Despite such extended share price gains, it seems that Chipotle stock could soon approach the $3,500 threshold. The fast-casual Mexican restaurant keeps posting impressive same-store sales growth while quickly advancing its store expansion strategy. In the meantime, its margins keep expanding by the quarter, sustaining superb earnings growth. Thus, I remain bullish on CMG stock.\n\nQ1-2024 Results Fuel Bullish Sentiment\n\nChipotle\u2019s Q1-2024 results once again fueled the bullish sentiment that has long surrounded the company. The stock\u2019s sustained rally certainly displays this. What\u2019s quite interesting is that, despite the years of skepticism from critics who dismiss Chipotle as merely a cult stock, the company consistently delivers exceptional results that defy industry norms. Let\u2019s take a closer look at Chipotle\u2019s Q1 report, which demonstrates this continuous success.\n\nChipotle Replicates Its Strategy, Drives Double-Digit Growth\n\nChipotle\u2019s Q1 earnings once again delivered double-digit revenue growth, driven by the company replicating its well-established strategy. More specifically, total revenues grew by 14.1% to $2.7 billion for the quarter. This marked the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This stunning momentum can be attributed to the company replicating what has already proven to be a seemingly simple yet effective strategy: open new stores and grow sales in existing ones.\n\nIn Q1, comparable sales from existing locations rose by 7.0%. Meanwhile, by the end of March, Chipotle had 3,479 restaurants open, up from 3,437 last quarter and 3,224 last year. Source: Chipotle Q1-2024 Results\n\nNotably, the opening of 47 restaurants in Q1 continued the accelerated expansion trend observed in Q4, with the company opening six more restaurants than the same period last year. This illustrates Chipotle\u2019s capacity to support higher levels of capital expenditures due to the gradual generation of significantly higher operating cash flows. More importantly, even with raised capital expenditures, there is still room left for the company\u2019s free cash flow levels to grow substantially.\n\nTo support this argument, Chipotle generated operating cash flow of $1.90 billion during the past four quarters, up 27% from last year. Thus, despite capital expenditures hitting a record high of $573.1 million during the same period\u2014an increase of 13.8% year-over-year, reflecting Chipotle\u2019s boosted spending to expand its footprint\u2014free cash flow still surged by 33%, reaching $1.32 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nMargin Expansion to Sustain Surging Profits\n\nYou might have noticed that Chipotle\u2019s 27% year-over-year increase in operating cash flow over the past 12 months significantly outpaces its revenue growth. This can be attributed to its steadily improving restaurant-level margins, driven by rising same-store sales.\n\nAs same-store sales keep rising against a backdrop of stable overhead costs, it\u2019s quite easy for Chipotle to achieve economies of scale. Also, the fact that Chipotle owns all of its restaurants eliminates the need to pay incremental royalties with the growth of same-store sales, further strengthening its restaurant-level margins. In fact, Chipotle\u2019s restaurant-level margin expansion tends to significantly affect its overall profitability prospects, with earnings growth historically exceeding revenue growth by a wide margin.\n\nChipotle\u2019s Q1 numbers were a great example of this trend. Chipotle\u2019s average restaurant sales climbed to $3.082 million from last year\u2019s $2.892 million, reflecting the same-store sales growth mentioned earlier. Consequently, its restaurant-level operating margin rose by 190 basis points to 27.5%.\n\nNow, factor in Chipotle\u2019s robust revenue growth of 14.1%, the bolstered restaurant-level margin, and the absence of debt on its balance sheet\u2014meaning no interest expenses to weigh down net income growth\u2014and it\u2019s clear how adjusted earnings for the quarter soared by an impressive 27% to $369.3 million.\n\nValuation Concerns Remain, But Winners Come at a Hefty Price\n\nChipotle\u2019s extended rally has actually exceeded the company\u2019s underlying growth, resulting in a notable valuation expansion in recent months. This is certainly concerning. In particular, the stock is now trading at a forward P/E of about 55x, which sounds quite absurd. It\u2019s even more absurd to support that the stock can sustain its ongoing rally toward $3500\u2014and yet I wouldn\u2019t exclude the possibility of this scenario unfolding.\n\nWhy? As I mentioned earlier, Chipotle undeniably enjoys a revered status among investors\u2014and rightfully so. The company posts strong same-store sales growth quarter after quarter while aggressively expanding its presence worldwide. This trend clearly instills confidence in investors, who foresee ample room for future growth.\n\nThe argument here is that with Chipotle poised to maintain its robust double-digit revenue and earnings growth, it will eventually be able to grow into its rich valuation. My time researching stocks has taught me that winners rarely trade at a discount, and Chipotle\u2019s hefty valuation certainly proves this.\n\nIs CMG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nLooking at Wall Street\u2019s view on the stock, Chipotle Mexican Grill has gathered a Moderate Buy consensus rating. This is based on 18 Buys and eight Hold ratings assigned in the past three months. At $3250.58, the\u00a0average CMG stock price target suggests 2.8% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell CMG stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Eric Gonzalez\u00a0from KeyBanc, with an average return of 38.47% per rating and an 87% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nChipotle\u2019s first-quarter results once again stressed its strong momentum, marked by double-digit revenue growth and a continuous margin expansion. Valuation concerns will likely keep investors questioning the stock\u2019s prospects. Yet, as long as Chipotle keeps showing such progress across the board, I believe that there will be enough bulls to keep propelling the stock higher\u2014at least for now. Thus, I wouldn\u2019t exclude the possibility of Chipotle seeing further share price gains in the short term.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The stock market has gotten off to a red-hot start in 2024. The S&P 500 has risen 11%, and positive investor enthusiasm doesn't appear to be slowing down.\n\nWhat I find encouraging is that these strong returns are spread out across many different sectors. One company that is performing particularly well is restaurant chainChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG).\n\nChipotle is a prominent holding of hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management. In March, Chipotle's Board of Directors approved a 50-for-1 stock split. Importantly, shareholders still need to approve the split at the company's annual meeting on June 6.\n\nLet's dive into the ins and outs of stock splits, and assess whether you should scoop up shares of Chipotle right now.\n\nWhy is Chipotle splitting its stock?\n\nStock splits are an interesting concept. A common misconception about stock splits is that the stock becomes cheaper after the split goes into effect. In reality, this is not the case.\n\nWhen a stock split occurs, a company increases its outstanding shares by the ratio in the split. In the case of Chipotle, current shareholders would receive 50 shares for every one share that they own.\n\nSince the number of outstanding shares rises, the stock price is lowered by the same multiple. Given this dynamic, stock splits do not inherently change the market capitalization of the company.\n\nFor Chipotle, there are a couple of obvious reasons why management is pursuing a stock split. In 2018, Chipotle was experiencing some operational challenges. The company appointed Brian Niccol as its chief executive officer in hopes that the food industry veteran could lead a turnaround. Since Niccol assumed the CEO position in March 2018, Chipotle stock has risen 926%.\n\nToday, the shares trade for roughly $3,200. This puts the stock handily out of reach for most retail investors. During Chipotle's first-quarter earnings call, management spoke about the proposed stock split, stating that it \"will make our stock more accessible to our employees, as well as a broader range of investors.\"\n\nAgain, while the split doesn't actually change the value of Chipotle, the lower stock price causes investors to perceive shares as more affordable and thereby tends to spur some new buying activity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow is Chipotle performing?\n\nIt's no secret that the macroeconomy has been facing a tough battle with inflation for almost two years now. Indeed, while inflation has cooled to 3.4%, prices remain elevated in certain areas and are weighing on the consumer.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, food and grocery prices have been particularly stubborn. Since Chipotle is a fast-casual restaurant and ultimately a consumer discretionary type of purchase, you might think the business is struggling right now.\n\nHowever, the charts below illustrate a vastly different story. Not only are sales of Chipotle soaring, but operating margins are also expanding at an impressive rate. CMG Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThere are a couple of reasons. First, Chipotle is investing heavily in digital operations. People are increasingly opting for digital platforms in just about every product or service in today's world.\n\nDuring the first quarter, digital sales represented more than one-third of Chipotle's revenue. And at the end of the first quarter, Chipotle boasted nearly 40 million rewards members that it can reach through its app.\n\nBringing technology into the labor-intensive restaurant environment can result in more automation and enhanced order efficiency and fulfillment. If executed properly, these investments pay off in the form of repeat purchases and engaged customers.\n\nThis has helped Chipotle build incredibly strong brand equity while also achieving enviable pricing power over the competition. This translates into repeat customers, which can be seen in the company's financials.\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, Chipotle's same-store sales increased 7% year over year. By comparison, comparable sales at McDonald's only rose 2% year over year in the first quarter.\n\nIs Chipotle a good stock to buy right now?\n\nOne drawback of Chipotle stock is valuation. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 68, shares of Chipotle are pricey. However, I think the company has earned its premium valuation and still presents a compelling investment opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nRemember, should the stock split be approved by shareholders and go into effect in June, there is a good chance that some momentum will enter Chipotle and shares could surge. While it will look like you're buying Chipotle stock at a lower share price, you'd actually be paying an even higher valuation.\n\nConsidering the company has managed to grow in an otherwise volatile economy, coupled with its innovation efforts, I see even better days ahead for Chipotle. I think the investments in a digital platform will ultimately generate significant margin expansion and cash flow generation in the long run -- providing Chipotle with robust, sustainable financial flexibility.\n\nDespite a hefty price tag, I think now is a good time to scoop up some shares before the split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Contrary to popular belief, stock splits don't alter the value of a business. They just spread its earnings among a greater number of lower-priced shares. It's kind of like slicing up your favorite apple pie. You still have the same amount of gooey goodness. You simply divided it into smaller portions.\n\nStill, investors love stock splits. Perhaps they're right to do so. Companies that split their stock are typically firing on all cylinders -- and winners tend to keep on winning.\n\nIf you'd like to accelerate your search for the best stock-split stocks to buy today, read on.\n\nStock-split stock to buy No. 1: Walmart\n\nPersistent inflation is driving more people to shop for bargains -- and many are heading to Walmart(NYSE: WMT) to find them. The discount retailer's low prices have never been more appreciated by consumers and investors alike.\n\nWalmart's reputation for affordable groceries and other necessities is helping it win sales from higher-priced competitors. As the largest grocer in the U.S., the retail giant obtains the lowest prices from suppliers. These cost savings on food and other goods are attracting more people, including higher-income shoppers, to Walmart's stores.\n\nImportantly, the retailer is also seeing strong gains in its online sales. Rising demand for in-store pickup and delivery services drove Walmart's e-commerce revenue higher by 21% year over year in its fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ended April 30. An expanded selection of goods for sale offered by third-party merchants in the company's online marketplaces also contributed to the gains.\n\nFurthermore, these merchants pay handsome sums to advertise their wares on Walmart's fast-growing advertising network. The retail titan's ad revenue spiked 24% in the first quarter.\n\nThese higher-margin businesses, combined with Walmart's automation investments and cost-cutting measures, are enabling profits to grow faster than sales. The company's revenue rose 6% to $162 billion in the fiscal first quarter, while its adjusted operating income jumped 14% to $7 billion.\n\nWith its profits booming, Walmart chose to split its stock 3-for-1 earlier this year. And with its value-focused strategy unlikely to go out of style anytime soon, you can expect this retail leader's share price to continue to rise alongside its earnings.\n\nStock-split stock to buy No. 2: Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) is another high-quality business that's winning market share in a huge industry. The Tex-Mex specialist is expanding its sales and profits at a rapid pace at a time when many of its competitors are struggling to lure customers to their restaurants.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle's secret sauce isn't rocket science. Fresh, tasty, and responsibly sourced food is served quickly to order. Yet it's a recipe that rivals have struggled to replicate.\n\nMoreover, while many restaurant chains are finding it difficult to attract enough people to work in their stores, Chipotle is widely seen as offering a lucrative career path for its employees. Team members can earn as much as $100,000 per year in total compensation in as few as three years.\n\nThis dependable funnel of qualified personnel trained on the job to excel is enabling Chipotle to expand its store count at a solid clip. The fast-casual chain opened 47 new restaurants in the first quarter alone. That brought its total store count to nearly 3,500 locations. Management believes that figure could eventually top 7,000 in just North America. The company also has the potential to open many additional stores in international markets like Europe and the Middle East.\n\nBetter still, Chipotle's existing restaurants are becoming more profitable. Higher foot traffic and the company's efforts to speed up order processing times helped to boost its comparable-restaurant sales by 7% in the first quarter. Chipotle's restaurant-level operating margin, in turn, climbed to 27.5% from 25.6% in the prior-year period.\n\nWith its business booming, Chipotle wants to reward its investors with a stunning 50-for-1 stock split. Shareholders will likely authorize the proposal at the company's annual meeting on June 6. If approved, the stock split -- which would be one of the largest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange -- is slated to take place on June 25.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG have risen 51.1% over the past year against a 4.1% decline in the overall industry. The company\u2019s success is largely driven by strong digital initiatives, effective product branding and innovative menu offerings.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company boasts an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 22.7%. Projections for 2024 indicate that its earnings and revenues are expected to increase 23.2% and 15%, respectively, from the year-ago levels. Nevertheless, rising costs for commodities and wages remain concerning.\n\nCatalysts Driving Growth\n\nChipotle is intensifying its efforts to expand its digital program to drive growth, ensuring that digital ordering becomes more appealing for customers and more efficient for its restaurants. This digitization has improved its delivery system, bolstered by partnerships with Uber Eats and Grubhub, which are drawing in new customers.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, CMG has extended its digital capabilities into Canada and increased orders through collaborations with major third-party delivery services. To enhance the convenience of its digital ordering platform, management has introduced features such as unlimited customization, contactless delivery and group ordering.\r\n\r\nIn December 2023, Chipotle announced investments in Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity. Greenfield Robotics specializes in regenerative agriculture, using fleets of autonomous robots to weed fields without chemicals. Nitricity focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by creating natural fertilizer products to ensure sustainability.\r\n\r\nCMG is also testing smarter pickup times logic, based on different sales and deployment levels, to drive growth. Moreover, the company is exploring the use of robotics-based autonomous vehicles for delivery, which is expected to improve the customer experience in the near future.\r\n\r\nChipotle's emphasis on advertising initiatives is proving successful. The marketing team has effectively increased the brand's visibility, relevance and popularity. The recent comeback of the beloved Chicken Al Pastor as a limited-time offer exceeded expectations.\r\nIt also introduced the Carne Asada Quesadilla, showcasing the collaborative effort to reintroduce this popular menu item. This was especially noteworthy, considering that approximately 5% of U.S. beef meets its food integrity standards.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, management initiated promotions highlighting barbacoa, capitalizing on consumer insights which indicated a lack of awareness regarding it. Thus, CMG rebranded it as Braised Beef Barbacoa, highlighting it is slow-cooked, responsibly prepared beef seasoned with garlic and cumin, and hand-shredded. The campaign yielded positive results, driving increased transactions and spending. This apart, the company sustained the Behind the Foil brand campaign.\r\n\r\nFocus on operations strengthens CMG\u2019s core value proposition, offering customized, delicious culinary delights quickly with great hospitality. Operational enhancements and accessible menu pricing have fortified this proposition, leading to positive transaction comps throughout the year, with a 5% increase in 2023.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerns\n\nChipotle, like other industry players, has been facing significant supply-chain challenges and inflation across most commodities and categories. During the first quarter of 2024, food, beverage and packaging costs were $779 million compared with $692.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily caused by beef and produce inflation, and a challenge in the protein mix resulting from the Braised Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative. Labor costs increased 13% year over year to $659.5 million. This was mainly due to wage inflation and higher performance-based compensation.\n\nKey Picks\n\nWingstop Inc. WING sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 21.4%, on average. The stock has risen 93.6% in the past year.

Hence, restaurant stocks are likely to be impacted by a more cautious consumer amidst a worsening economic outlook. Keeping that in mind, investors should separate the wheat from the chaff, investing in the best restaurant stocks to buy.\n\nThe growing disparity between the inflation rates for food at home and food away from home will significantly impact consumer behavior. Consequently, you\u2019re likely to see a lot of pressure being exerted on company bottom-lines in the future.\u00a0 Therefore, companies must be more dynamic in their strategies to maintain profitability effectively.

Over the past couple of decades, the firm has maintained an impressive record of top-and-bottom-line growth through effective decision-making.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, with a multi-faceted\u00a0strategy involving geographical expansion and same-store sales expansion, Shake Shack\u2019s operational performance has been off the charts. Additionally, it continues to expand to new locations, benefitting from economies of scale.\n\nThough it\u2019s currently navigating some tough headwinds like its peers, its top-and-bottom-line metrics are in line with its historical averages. In each of the four quarters last year, it posted double-digit growth in sales, along with a sizable improvement in net profits. In fact, it flipped the script last year, posting a $20.3 million net profit compared to a considerable $21.2 million net loss in 2022.\u00a0 Moreover, it kept up the momentum in the first quarter (Q1), reporting a 12.3% increase in year-over-year (YOY) sales to $443.4 million.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is another bellwether in the fast-food industry, which continues to stand out from its competition for its strong customer loyalty. Despite the rising costs and resultant price increases over the years, its customers continue to flock to Chipotle locations.\n\nIts tremendous brand equity can be gauged from the consistency of its financial performance. Its 5-year average revenue and EBITDA growth stand at an eye-catching 15% and 32%, respectively. Recent results are in line with its lofty historical averages, bolstering its free cash flows to just under the $1 billion mark on a trailing-twelve-month (TTM) basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts Q1 results showed an impressive 14.1% increase in sales YOY and a 23.9% increase in diluted EPS. Moreover, it opened 47 new restaurants during the quarter, with its management setting a long-term target of more than doubling its business in North America and expanding internationally.\n\nCMG stock has a hefty price tag\u2014enough to justify splurging on a luxurious weekend getaway instead of buying it. However, sustained investor interest in the stock indicates a healthy growth runway ahead.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ) Has Become the Top Name in Pizza\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ)\u00a0is one of the most beloved pizza chains globally, and it has been an incredibly rewarding investment over the years. Had you invested $50,000 in DPZ stock ten years ago, you will have compounded that investment to $359,000. That doesn\u2019t include the impact of its robust dividend, which it\u2019s been growing over the past decade.\n\nIts monstrous success is linked to its rapid sales growth over the years, underpinned by its strategy of saturating a market with its stores. This strategy has paid many dividends, which it continues to reap despite the market headwinds.\n\nIt recently released another solid earnings report, beating analyst estimates across both lines with a hefty margin. Q1 sales of $1.08 billion grew 6% on a YOY basis, while its EPS of $3.58 surged by 22.2%. Quarterly net income jumped by 20% YoY to $126 million, while same-store sales in the U.S. grew 5.6%, fueled by delivery orders.\n\nLooking ahead, there\u2019s plenty of reason to believe the fast-food giant will continue growing at a rapid clip. Its effective pricing strategies and diverse menu offerings will continue driving top-line expansion as it plans to open 1,100 more stores by 2028, with\u00a0even larger gains ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Chipotle Mexican Grill is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.22 = US$1.7b \u00f7 (US$8.4b - US$997m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nSo, Chipotle Mexican Grill has an ROCE of 22%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Chipotle Mexican Grill compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Chipotle Mexican Grill  for free.\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Chipotle Mexican Grill Tell Us?\n\nThe trends we've noticed at Chipotle Mexican Grill are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 22%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 83%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nTo sum it up, Chipotle Mexican Grill has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Since the stock has returned a staggering 379% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.\n\nIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Chipotle Mexican Grill, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this freelist of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Should You Buy Cava Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "Every restaurant investor is looking for the next Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). The fast-casual restaurant chain has posted phenomenal returns for investors after taking its healthy Mexican fare across the U.S. The company currently has a market capitalization of $86 billion, making it one of the largest restaurant brands in the world.\n\nThe success of Chipotle has spawned a lot of fast-casual restaurant copycats. One of the most successful is Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA), which has a similar concept to Chipotle but with Mediterranean food. It is growing its restaurant count like gangbusters and went public through an initial public offering (IPO) less than a year ago.\n\nShould you buy Cava stock for your portfolio right now?\n\nMediterranean fast casual? Mediterranean fast casual\n\nCava does build-your-own grain bowls and sandwich wraps in a similar fashion to Chipotle. But instead of Mexican food, it does Mediterranean wraps with falafel, hummus, and pita bread. In 2023, Cava locations did $2.6 million in average unit volumes (AUVs) with 24.8% restaurant-level profit margins. This novel concept seems to be resonating with customers, as foot traffic per store increased 10% year over year in 2023.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Cava had 309 restaurant units. Last year, it generated $717.1 million in revenue, up an astonishing 60% from 2022. The company is expanding rapidly with this restaurant concept, and doing so while still generating a profit. Cava Group net income was $13.9 million in 2023. It is rare to find a company growing this quickly that is also profitable, which is a great sign for investors.\n\nIncoming national expansion\n\nIn its IPO documents, management said it thinks there is room for at least 1,000 Cava restaurant locations in the United States. Last year, it opened 72 stores, and it plans to open 50 more in 2024. If the company opens 50 restaurants each year, it will hit around 1,000 units 14 years from now. This gives the company a long runway to reinvest for growth, which is important for growth stock investors to consider.\n\nAssuming AUVs can expand to $3 million -- a conservative estimate if you think inflation is even slightly positive -- 1,000 units should equate to $3 billion in annual sales from Cava restaurants. That would be more than 4x its 2023 sales levels, even with conservative AUV assumptions. The company began on the East Coast of the United States and now has toeholds in places like California and Colorado.\n\nWith comparable sales still strong at 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023, it looks like Cava's fast-casual concept is resonating around the country. This should indicate to investors that Cava can reinvest in new markets like Colorado and California with strong returns to drive revenue and earnings higher for years to come.\n\nStory continues CAVA PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe stock is not cheap\n\nCava has a long runway of growth ahead of it. That doesn't automatically make the stock a buy, though. Growth is just a factor in valuing a stock. The price you pay matters too.\n\nToday, Cava has a market cap of $8.8 billion. Let's assume the company hits its $3 billion revenue target and can hit Chipotle-level profit margins of 17%. That would equate to $510 million in annual earnings on $3 billion in sales. Compared to today's market cap, that's a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 17. This feels like a reasonable valuation for a maturing restaurant stock.\n\nBut how many years forward will these earnings show up? Eight? 10? A restaurant concept can't magically grow 1,000 new locations overnight. For this reason, I think investors are aggressively pricing in future growth at Cava. It is hard to see how shares will beat the market over the next five to 10 years unless it can greatly increase its AUVs.\n\nCava is a great business, but the stock looks overvalued. Investors should stay patient and keep this restaurant stock on a watchlist for now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Chipotle a Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity Ahead of Its 50-for-1 Stock Split?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) made headlines a couple of months ago that investors appear to be cheering for these days. Since the announcement of a 50-for-1 stock split in March, shares have climbed about 14%.\n\nInvestors probably view this as a key catalyst that could send shares of this restaurant enterprise to new heights -- and it might present a potential buying window.\n\nBefore shareholders vote in June on the approval of this stock split, is Chipotle a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity?\n\nA historic stock split\n\nInvestors should first understand the mechanics of a stock split. When a company does well for a long period of time, it's not unusual to see the share price rise to a high nominal figure. Management teams keep tabs on the share price. Their goal is to make the stock more accessible to all investors, even ones with less capital.\n\n\"This is the first stock split in Chipotle's 30-year history, and we believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors,\" said CFO Jack Hartung in a press release announcing the news in March.\n\nIf this proposal gets approved, then every existing shareholder will receive 49 more shares of Chipotle stock. So, there will be 50 times more outstanding shares, all of which will trade at 1/50th the current price. This can be seen as cutting a pizza into smaller slices.\n\nInvestors need to realize that from a fundamental perspective, everything else stays the same with the business. This is still a company that operates restaurants that sell Tex-Mex food in a fast-casual setting.\n\nWatch your appetite\n\nNow, let's return to the original question of whether or not Chipotle is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity. It's important to separate the business and the stock from a quality and valuation perspective, respectively.\n\nIf you looked at Chipotle's financial results, you'd assume we are in a robust economic backdrop. Once again, the company proves that its superior value proposition, namely selling food with real ingredients at compelling price points, resonates tremendously with consumers.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Chipotle reported revenue growth of 14.1%. This was boosted by a same-store sales gain of 7%, as well as the opening of 47 new locations. This followed a 14.3% revenue increase for all of 2023. Demand isn't an issue, which is impressive given that Chipotle raised menu prices on numerous occasions over the past couple of years to combat inflationary pressures.\n\nThat pricing power helped drive a sizzling 23.2% rise in net income in Q1. Chipotle's profitability has improved at a faster pace than the top line, as operational efficiencies take hold.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, there is a sizable expansionary runway for the business to penetrate. Management is confident that Chipotle can double its footprint of 3,479 stores (as of March 31) to 7,000 in North America. This target is up from a previous goal of 6,000, indicative of the leadership team's rising optimism.\n\nEven more eye-opening, this figure doesn't include expansion into overseas markets. Chipotle already has a tiny presence in Europe. And it just opened its first location in the Middle East, with three more planned. If these stores perform well, it's anyone's guess what the ultimate store count could be.\n\nHowever, just because a company is dominating its industry, growing sales and profit at a rapid clip, and staring at tremendous growth potential, that doesn't make the stock an automatic buy. The missing ingredient we need to add to our analysis is valuation.\n\nUnlike the burritos and bowls it sells, the stock is extremely expensive, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 68. Credit goes to the shares' huge outperformance in recent years.\n\nWhile I believe Chipotle is far from being a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity today, the company should still be on your radar. If there's a major pullback, then the stock could be a smart buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Buying food at a restaurant is more convenient than making it yourself. You can also find restaurants with tasty and healthy options. These dynamics have resulted in billion-dollar corporations emerging as household names.\n\nHowever, some restaurants have been facing pushback for their higher prices.

Luckily, some restaurant stocks to buy are still performing well, including these top picks.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has received plenty of love on Wall Street. The stock has 18 Buy ratings and 8 Hold ratings from analysts. The stock has received several price target hikes, including a $3,600 target, implying a 14% upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Mexican restaurant chain has been outperforming many stocks. It\u2019s up 38% year-to-date and has surged 339% over the past five years. A recently announced 50-for-1 stock split has brought additional attention to the company\u2019s stock.\n\nChipotle reported a solid first quarter, while other restaurant firms warned about pricing pressure hurting their growth. The restaurant firm reported 14.1% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth and 23.9% YOY growth in its diluted EPS. Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants and is on track to open 285 to 315 restaurants in 2024.\n\nMany consumers buy food at Chipotle because it is a healthier alternative to other fast food restaurants. Healthy food comes with a higher price, and consumers have stuck around despite the price hikes.\n\nWingstop (WING) A close-up of a Wingstop (WING) sign on a green circle background.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you like Chipotle, you\u2019ll probably like Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) too. This stock comes with a lofty valuation but delivers high revenue and earnings growth. It\u2019s received several Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. The highest price target of $461 per share suggests the stock can rally by an additional 18%.\n\nWingstop crushed the stock market. It\u2019s up 53% year-to-date and surged 393% over the past five years. Investors continue to load up on the stock due to its impressive financials. System-wide sales increased by 36.8% YOY in Q1 2024. The company also opened 65 new restaurants during the quarter, which was more than Chipotle. Total revenue increased by 34.1% YoY, while net income surged by 83.5% YoY.\n\nThese developments point to rapid profit margin expansions and plenty of runway for future growth. The company closed the quarter with 2,279 restaurants, which includes 305 international restaurants.\n\nStory continues\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) won plenty of support on Wall Street with 10 Buy ratings and 14 Hold ratings. The highest price target of $190 per share suggests a 13% gain is on the way.\n\nLike the two restaurant stocks that came before it, Texas Roadhouse has outperformed the stock market. It\u2019s up 39% year-to-date and gained 210% over the past five years. The southwestern steakhouse chain trades at a 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.34% yield. The valuation can attract value investors scared off by the valuations of the other two restaurant stocks. It even has a good dividend growth rate. Texas Roadhouse recently hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.55 to $0.61 per share. That\u2019s a 10.9% YOY improvement.\n\nTexas Roadhouse also has financials worth your attention. Revenue increased by 12.5% YOY, while net income jumped by 31.0% YOY in Q1 2024. The company opened nine company restaurants and three franchise restaurants in the quarter. Texas Roadhouse has 753 total restaurants across its brands.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Restaurants\u2019 gross margins are increasing because the prices that they pay for goods, services and labor are no longer rising rapidly. Some of their costs are increasing slowly, while others are falling. Instead of lowering prices in response to their easing cost pressures, restaurant chains are reporting higher profits and/or buying back their shares. For example, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), mentioned that it has seen labor costs stabilize and lower-than-expected commodity prices. With restaurant chains getting a boost from easing cost pressures and strong spending by the top 30% or so of wage earners, here are three top restaurant stocks to buy.\n\nShake Shack (SHAK) The Shake Shack (SHAK) on 125th Street in Harlem, New York City, USA\n\nSource: Here Now / Shutterstock.com\n\nShake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) stock rose almost 6% in the last month, and 70% in the last six months. It\u2019s safe to say, SHAK is indeed sizzling.\n\nIn March, Shake Shack tapped Papa John\u2019s (NASDAQ:PZZA) CEO Rob Lynch to take its top spot. Under Lynch, who became CEO of Papa John\u2019s in 2019, the pizza chain\u2019s operating income surged from $19.8 million in 2019 to $156.4 million last year. As a result, I expect Shake Shack to continue to perform very well over the long term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the first quarter, the chain\u2019s revenue jumped 15% versus the same period a year earlier to $290.5 million, while its EBITDA jumped 30% year-over-year to $35.9 million.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has become one of the top restaurant stocks to buy in America and is quite popular among millennials, whose spending power is rapidly increasing. The firm\u2019s revenue jumped 14% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to a huge $2.7 billion. Moreover, its comparable restaurant sales climbed a rather impressive 7% year-over-year in Q1.\n\nThe firm is also benefiting from the previously mentioned profit-margin gains. Indeed, Chipotle\u2019s operating margin came in at 26.3% last quarter, up from 15.5% in Q1 of 2023. As a result, it\u2019s not surprising that the company\u2019s earnings per share jumped 14% year-over-year to $13.01.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Dailygives Chipotle its highest possible Composite Rating of 99, and the shares have risen over 40% so far this year.\n\nDutch Bros (BROS) Dutch Brothers (BROS) at Papago Plaza in Scottsdale Arizona. restaurant stocks to buy\n\nSource: RicoPatagonia / Shutterstock.com\n\nI believe that Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been meaningfully hurt by strong, growing competition from Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS). That\u2019s largely because the latter coffee chain has become a favorite among millennials.\n\nDutch Bros recently reported very strong Q1 results as its revenue jumped 40% versus the same period a year earlier to $275 million. Moreover, its adjusted same shop sales soared by a very impressive 10%, and its adjusted EBITDA soared 120% YOY to $52.5 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestment bank TD Cowen responded to the company\u2019s Q1 results by upgrading the shares to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201chold.\u201d The bank expects the company to report stronger-than-expected 2024 results. TD Cowen believes that the company is benefiting from its innovative beverages, targeted loyalty program offers and paid ads.\n\nBROS stock climbed 15% in the five days, and Investor\u2019s Business Dailygives the name a Composite Rating of 98 out of 99.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Move Over, Walmart and Chipotle: Wall Street Has a New Stock-Split Stock",
        "content": "Volatility is something that's inescapable for investors on Wall Street. With the exception of 2024, we've witnessed the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite seesaw between bear and bull markets in successive years since this decade began.\n\nDuring bouts of heightened volatility and uncertainty, professional and everyday investors typically turn their attention to businesses with lengthy track records of outperformance. Over the last three years, companies enacting stock splits have certainly fit the bill. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors are rightly gravitating to stock-split stocks\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count. It's a purely cosmetic change in the sense that adjusting a company's share price and share count by the same factor has no impact on its market cap or operating performance.\n\nForward-stock splits are designed to make a company's shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases with their online broker. Meanwhile, reverse-stock splits aim to increase a company's share price to ensure it meets the minimum listing requirements on a major stock exchange.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, most investors seek out companies enacting forward-stock splits. A public company with a high-flying stock often possesses well-defined competitive advantages and has, in many instances, out-innovated their competition. In other words, forward-stock splits can act as a beacon to alert investors to Wall Street's top companies.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, close to a dozen top-tier businesses have enacted or announced a forward split, including the likes of Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet. Earlier this week, another brand-name company announced its intent to join this elite group of stock-split stocks.\n\nWalmart and Chipotle Mexican Grill have claimed the stock-split spotlight in 2024\n\nFollowing a relatively quiet 2023, which saw just a few top-notch companies announce stock splits (e.g., Monster Beverage and Novo Nordisk), 2024 has kicked off with a bang.\n\nIn late January, retail titan Walmart(NYSE: WMT) announced plans to conduct a 3-for-1 split. The purpose of this split, which was Walmart's first in nearly a quarter of a century, was to help its associates take part in the company's Associate Stock Purchase Plan. Reducing its share price by a factor of three will make it easier for its employees to purchase whole shares of stock.\n\nWalmart's long-term outperformance -- and the reason its share price merited a 3-for-1 split that was effected on February 26 -- can be explained by its size. The company's deep pockets allow it to purchase products in bulk and at a lower cost than its peers. It's consistently undercutting grocery chains and local stores on price, which is a clear lure to consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart's stores also carry a broad selection of stock keeping units (SKUs). Not only does this help the company sell higher margin discretionary goods, but it prompts consumers to make Walmart their one-stop shopping destination.\n\nThe other superstar that's taken center stage in 2024 is fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). In mid-March, Chipotle's board announced plans to conduct a 50-for-1 forward split that would take effect on June 26 (assuming shareholders approve the split at the company's annual meeting in June).\n\nSimilar to Walmart, Chipotle is conducting a split to make its nearly $3,200-per-share stock more accessible to its employees. If shareholders give Chipotle the green light, its shares will trade closer to $64 by late June.\n\nThe better than 14,300% increase in Chipotle Mexican Grill's stock since its initial public offering in January 2006 reflects consumers' willingness to pay more for healthier foods. Further, the company's limited menu helps its staff prepare meals quickly, which ensures a timely delivery process to in-store and drive-thru (\"Chipotlane\") customers.\n\nBut it's time for Walmart and Chipotle to move over, because there's another high-profile company that's ready to share the stock-split spotlight. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSay hello to Wall Street's newest stock-split stock\n\nOn May 14, consumer electronics juggernaut Sony Group(NYSE: SONY) threw its hat into the ring and announced its intent to conduct a 5-for-1 forward split.\n\nAlthough the record date of its stock split is set for September 30, the effective date will be a bit different for its Japanese-listed shares and American Depository Receipts (ADR) in the U.S. Whereas its shares in Japan will begin trading at a reduced nominal share price on October 1, the U.S. ADRs have an effective date of October 8. When complete, this split will lower Sony Group's U.S. shares from the $81 they closed at on May 14 to around $16.\n\nMost people are familiar with Sony because of its longtime ties to the gaming industry. The company's PlayStation 5 gaming console debuted back in November 2020, so it's not all that surprising that unit sales haven't been all that strong of late.\n\nThankfully, Sony has seen a healthy uptick in PlayStation Plus revenue. PlayStation Plus is the company's gaming subscription service that ranges from $10 per month to $160 per year, depending on the subscription tier. It allows subscribers to back up their saved gaming data to the cloud, as well as join friends in multiplayer games. The key point here being that subscription revenue tends to generate predictable, high-margin revenue year after year.\n\nBut there's more to Sony Group than just its PlayStation gaming console. For instance, it's one of the key producers of image sensors used in next-generation smartphones. Inclusive of favorable currency exchange rates, imaging and sensing solutions sales jumped by 14% in the company's latest fiscal year (ended March 31). With global smartphone sales expected to modestly expand this year, Sony should be a clear beneficiary.\n\nWall Street's newest stock-split stock has a profitable film entertainment segment, too. Sony Pictures delivered 9% sales growth last year, with an increase in theatrical releases paving the way for this growth. Sony Pictures is also working with private-equity firm Apollo Global Management and mulling a firm bid for legacy media company Paramount Global. The two companies recently sent a nonbinding offer to Paramount's board that would take the company private at a $26 billion valuation, including the assumption of debt.\n\nThe cherry on the sundae for Sony Group and its shareholders is that the company also announced a share repurchase authorization along with its 5-for-1 stock split. Over the next year, a maximum of 30 million shares can be repurchased, which represents nearly 2.5% of the company's outstanding shares (based on its outstanding share count after its coming split).\n\nFor time-tested businesses with steady or growing net income, buybacks can increase earnings per share (EPS) and make a company's stock appear more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sony Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sony Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Sony Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this Mexican food chain have returned +8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, which Chipotle falls in, has gained 0.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Chipotle is expected to post earnings of $15.56 per share, indicating a change of +23% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $55.28 points to a change of +23.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.6%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $66.47 indicates a change of +20.2% from what Chipotle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Chipotle.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMG _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Chipotle, the consensus sales estimate of $2.92 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.2%. The $11.35 billion and $12.83 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15% and +13%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nChipotle reported revenues of $2.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.1%. EPS of $13.37 for the same period compares with $10.50 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.01%. The EPS surprise was +14.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nChipotle is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Chipotle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CMG for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Chipotle Mexican Grill's main business drivers.\n\nA Delaware corporation, Chipotle Mexican Grill, together with its subsidiaries, operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains. The company was founded in 1993 by Steve Ells, who started with a single restaurant in Denver, CO. The company offers a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. Chipotle restaurants feature free-range, hormone-free pork, natural chicken and other meat products cooked using traditional methods and served in a unique atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe company is committed to using high-quality real ingredients, classic cooking techniques and distinctive interior design to serve customers. As of Dec 31, 2023, the company owned and operated more than 3,400 restaurants across the United States, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth is significantly driven by its digital platform. It has enhanced its capabilities by digitizing restaurant kitchens, expanding partnerships with third-party delivery services, and increasing the number of Chipotlanes (drive-through format for customer pick-up of digital orders). Digital sales, encompassing revenue generated through the Chipotle website, Chipotle app, or third-party delivery aggregators, which also includes revenue deferrals linked to Chipotle Rewards, constituted 37.4% of food and beverage revenue in 2023, compared to 39.4% in 2022 and 45.0% in 2021. The company has facilitated convenient digital ordering through enhancements to the Chipotle app and website, including unlimited customization, contactless delivery, and group ordering.\r\n\r\nThe company utilizes multiple marketing channels, including national television, digital marketing, social media, fundraising, events and sponsorships to reach consumers. Third-party service providers mostly provide delivery services.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Chipotle launched a loyalty program called Chipotle Rewards, which provides customers with the opportunity to earn bonus points or free food. Earned rewards generally expire one to six months after they are issued and points typically expire if an account is inactive for six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Chipotle Mexican Grill ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $6,298.92, or a gain of 529.89%, as of May 15, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 177.82% and the price of gold increased 73.35% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for CMG.\n\nShares of Chipotle have outperformed the industry in the past year. The company reported first-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, the company reported benefits stemming from enhanced throughput and effective marketing initiatives like Braised Beef Barbacoa and Chicken Al Pastor, leading to strong sales and transaction growth. Also, consistent strength in digital sales, rise in menu prices and new restaurant openings bode well. Going forward, it continues to focus on the stage gate process and leveraging digital programs to expand access and convenience. However, elevated wage and commodity inflation pose concerns. For 2024, the company expects the cost of sales to be in the low to mid-single-digit range.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 7.96%, and there have been 14 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Why Britons will never earn as much as Americans",
        "content": "US UK Salaries\n\nPay in Britain has long lagged behind the United States, with the average worker earning \u00a317,000 less per year.\n\nThe average salary was just over \u00a352,000 in the US last year, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the UK equivalent was \u00a335,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nA recent report from the Social Market Foundation think tank found that Americans are a third richer than the average British person. Why are salaries so much higher in the United States?\n\nBig disparities\n\nThree years ago, US burrito chain Chipotle advertised that new hires could quickly make a $100,000 (\u00a380,000) salary. The viral tweet became a sensation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFast-food workers in the UK make \u00a318,000 a year on average, according to job search engine Glassdoor. How could their American counterparts be eyeing up a six-figure salary?\n\nThe case became a stand-in for all that was wrong in the country\u2019s economy, from productivity to inactivity to the tax burden.\n\nYou can now make $100k at chipotle in under 3 years pic.twitter.com/lG2itpIndp\n\n\u2014 the Rich (@Duderichy) April 28, 2024\n\nThis disparity persists in 2024. Employment platform Indeed shows manager positions at Chipotle locations over the past 12 months advertised average earnings of $55,500 \u2013 equal to \u00a344,400 at the current exchange rate. In Britain, the same position pays \u00a310,000 a year lower.\n\nAn entry-level \u201ccrew member\u201d job in Eureka, California advertises a pay range up to \u00a321.50, or \u00a317.20, depending on experience. The same position in Putney, in south-west London, offers \u00a311.30 as a base rate. But Chipotle \u2013 and fast-food workers \u2013 are not outliers.\n\nAcross different industries, there are huge disparities between British and American salaries.\n\nLawyers are a prime example. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean annual wage for those employed in \u201clegal occupations\u201d was just under $134,000 last year, or \u00a3107,000. ONS data shows workers engaged in \u201clegal activities\u201d in the UK made an average of \u00a347,000 \u2013 less than half.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is the same case for barbers and hairdressers, who stand to make the equivalent of \u00a333,000 a year across the pond, yet take home little over \u00a315,000 here. It is similarly acute for translators and interpreters, who make \u00a350,500 in the US versus \u00a324,500 in the UK.\n\nIt is not the case in every industry \u2013 travel agents, for example, earn an average of \u00a340,000 a year in the US and \u00a338,000 in the US, and gambling services workers make \u00a331,000 in the US versus \u00a329,500 here.\n\nBroad industry comparisons like this, however, come with the caveat that the jobs included within these sector categories may differ, as may the tasks and responsibilities within the jobs themselves. The other benefits included also highlight the difference between wages and compensation.\n\nWhy is Britain so far behind?\n\nReal wages \u2013 the value of pay cheques after accounting for inflation \u2013 flatlined in the UK for years. After growing by an average of 33pc a decade between 1970 and 2007, stagnation set in after the financial crisis.\n\nThe recession in the US was shallower, and it recovered from it faster. This is borne out at the economy-wide level. Real US GDP grew by 2.5pc in 2023, compared to just 0.1pc for the UK \u2013 the country\u2019s worst performance since 2009, and one capped off in the closing months by a slip into recession.\n\nIn the short term, things are changing. According to Indeed, earnings in the UK grew by 6.5pc over the year to the first quarter of 2024 \u2013 relative to 3.1pc in the US.\n\nYet think tank the Resolution Foundation is doubtful of the longevity of this trend, with the UK\u2019s unshakeable productivity problem to blame. Describing the value created per worker for each hour worked, in 2023 the figure came to $70 in the US and just $59 in the UK.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation noted that productivity in the UK actually fell over the 12 months leading up to the final quarter of 2023. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the \u00a317,000 gulf between average annual salaries on either side of the Atlantic will close any time soon.\n\nThe compensation question\n\nIt is no secret that European employees are legally entitled to a host of benefits \u2013 which US workers can only negotiate for or dream of. In many cases, America proves a stand-out for all the wrong reasons in this regard.\n\nBritish people on a contract get a statutory minimum of 28 days paid annual leave, including bank holidays. The US is alone among advanced economies in not having any such provision. Although it varies from job to job as a result, American employees tend to get 10 days annual leave on average.\n\nEligible UK employees are also free to make use of up to 52 weeks of paid maternity leave, and up to two weeks of paternity leave. The US equivalent, introduced some as recently as 1993, gives new mothers only 12 weeks off, well below the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) 16-week recommended minimum.\n\nThose in the UK also have a guaranteed \u00a3116.75 a week statutory sick pay for up to 28 weeks should they be unable to work due to ill health. There is no such safety net at a federal level in the US, and only a handful of states have their own compensation schemes.\n\nThe treatment British workers may require during this time is also free at the point of use in the NHS. The private model in the US means uninsured workers would have to pay out a considerable sum during this period. Research has found some 3 million Americans have over $10,000 in medical debt.\n\nLiving standards lagging\n\nBut do these extras actually make up for lower wages? Especially since the tax burden \u2013 a portion of which goes towards funding the NHS \u2013 is far higher in the UK than in the US.\n\nHMRC tax revenue over the past financial year works out to just over \u00a31 trillion, or 40pc of GDP \u2013 the highest level since the early 1980s. The equivalent US rate is below 28pc.\n\nPurchasing power parity (PPP) adjusts wage figures for the amount of goods and services in a common basket people in different countries can buy \u2013 the purchasing power for each unit of currency. Far from redressing the US/UK imbalance, this equalisation makes it starker.\n\nOECD data shows that in real terms 2022 dollars PPP, US employees made $78,000 a year to the UK\u2019s $54,500 \u2013 some 43pc less. This means UK workers are considerably worse off than their US counterparts, all things considered.\n\nThe US\u2019s low tax, low regulation environment has maintained its lead in this domain for more than a century. The UK would need to maintain the unprecedented 3.5pc real wage growth lead over the US in the first quarter of 2024 on an annual basis for eight years to catch up.",

        "content": "Where\u2019s the beef chicken?\n\nFood chains are pushing chicken, as the cheaper protein is easier for consumers' tightening wallets, aligns with healthy eating trends, and allows companies more room for innovation.\n\nFrom Chipotle (CMG) to Burger King (QSR), chicken was the star of the show in the latest earnings reports. Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo said restaurants are realizing they can \"combine a lower price point than might attract a decent consumer base with a decent level of flavor profiles.\"\n\nFor Chipotle, limited-time offers like Chicken al Pastor boosted results against a difficult macro consumer backdrop, with store foot traffic up 5.4%. Despite higher prices, its regular chicken burrito costs roughly $9 to $10 depending on location, which many still perceive as a value option.\n\nBurger King introduced a fiery buffalo royal crispy chicken wrap at $2.99 in the quarter, which contributed to its US same-store sales growth of 3.9%. Burger King is bringing the heat to its fan-favorite wraps with an all-new Fiery Buffalo Royal Crispy Wrap (Courtesy: Burger King)\n\nMeanwhile, Shake Shack (SHAK) offered a free chicken sandwich with a $10 purchase every Sunday in April, capitalizing on Chick-fil-A being closed on that day of the week.\n\nThe CEO of Dine Brands, which owns IHOP and Applebee's, even hinted at a limited-time value promotion around chicken next quarter to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThat increasing competition is hitting traditional chicken-only chains.\n\n\"At KFC US, same-store sales were pressured from unfavorable weather events and chicken value promotions from QSR competitors,\" David Gibbs, CEO of KFC's parent company Yum! Brands (YUM), recently said on an earnings call.\n\nMore companies will likely look to innovate in this space as diners struggle with stubborn food inflation.\n\n\"Price competition was really a challenge,\" CFRA analyst Siye Desta told Yahoo Finance. \"A lot of people have less of a budget, ... [and they think] the trade-off isn't worth it to pay that much more for beef.\"\n\nSince the pandemic, beef prices have been more inflationary and volatile than chicken. According to the latest Consumer Price Index data, whole chicken cost roughly $1.99 per pound, while ground beef fetched $5.13 per pound.\n\nTaco Bell (QSR) saw US sales increase by 2% as the brand launched a Chicken Cantina menu with slow-roasted chicken. Popeyes' US same-store sales jumped 6.2% last quarter as it pushed out a new wing offering.\n\nChicken wing chain Wingstop (WING) said innovation around flavor leads to repeat visits. \"Indulgent Wingstop occasions [is] something that consumers are starting to really appreciate, as they see others taking price,\" its CEO Michael Skipworth told Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its latest quarter, Wingstop saw US same-store sales leap 21.6%.\n\nGargiulo said limited-time offerings like Wingstop's hot honey sandwich also incentivize consumers to order the product.\n\n\"I can always have the burger, but ... when [a flavor is] only today and you're driven by curiosity and ... you feel that chicken can be healthier [and] cheaper, ... you're swapping beef with chicken,\" Gargiulo explained.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning of a larger shift, as chicken is \"associated more with health and wellness,\" Gargiulo added.\n\nClassic burger maker McDonald's (MCD) is facing some pressure on the burger side, Gargiulo pointed out, which they're countering by offering more chicken items.\n\n\"We are gaining market share in both chicken and beef,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said on a call with investors following its Q3 2023 results. At its investor day last December, it shared plans to bring its chicken sandwich, the McCrispy, to all markets by the end of 2025, while expanding into wraps and tenders.\n\nChicken now makes up $25 billion dollars in systemwide sales for the Golden Arches, equal to the beef segment, JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe said in a December note to clients. McDonald's chicken nuggets reel in $10 billion in systemwide sales and are growing at a rate of more than 10% annually since fiscal 2019.\n\nIvankoe added that the global chicken market is twice the size of beef \u2014 a factor to consider for fast food conglomerates looking to expand overseas.\n\nTyson Foods (TSN), which supplies a majority of quick-service restaurants in the US, said chicken will likely be used as a tactic to lure in customers. The company sells 19 billion-20 billion nuggets per year.\n\n\"Traffic at QSR has been under a little pressure,\" Tyson CEO Donnie King told Yahoo Finance. \"They're going to quickly respond to do something about that traffic, and getting chicken on a menu there or [promoting] chicken is, in my mind, a very likely scenario.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Prediction: These Are Wall Street's Next 3 Stock-Split Stocks to Follow Walmart and Chipotle Mexican Grill",
        "content": "Volatility is a common occurrence when putting your money to work on Wall Street. Since this decade began, the three major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions.\n\nWhen volatility and uncertainty arise, professional and retail investors have a habit of seeking the safety of outperforming stocks with well-defined competitive advantages. While the \"FAANG stocks\" are a good example of the type of leadership investors have sought during periods of stock market unrest, it's stocks enacting splits that have truly become a safety valve during periods of heightened volatility and uncertainty. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWalmart and Chipotle Mexican Grill joined elite company in 2024\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count. The reason it's a cosmetic change is because a stock split has no impact on a company's market cap or operating performance. Stock splits are solely intended to make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases (what's known as a \"forward-stock split\"), or to increase a company's share price to ensure minimum listing standards are met on major stock exchanges (what's known as a \"reverse-stock split\").\n\nThough there have been companies throughout history that went on to be wildly successful after conducting a reverse split, most attention is afforded to the high-flying businesses enacting forward-stock splits.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, close to a dozen high-profile companies have announced or completed a forward split. The newest members of this elite stock-split club are retailer Walmart(NYSE: WMT) and fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG).\n\nIn late February, Walmart enacted a 3-for-1 forward split, which was designed to encourage Walmart's employees to buy shares of their company's now more nominally affordable stock. Walmart has consistently enjoyed a size advantage over its peers, which allows it to purchase its products in bulk and undercut most grocery chains and local shops on price. This helps to explain its long-term outperformance, and the need to split its stock.\n\nSimilarly, Chipotle's stock split is also about making its share price more nominally affordable for its employees (I.e., to encourage stock ownership and investment participation). Chipotle Mexican Grill intends to complete a 50-for-1 forward split in late June if it receives the green light from its shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nThanks to its fresh food/no freezer promise, as well as its limited menu, which shortens wait times in its restaurants, Chipotle's stock has soared by more than 14,600% since its initial public offering in January 2006.\n\nPrediction: These prominent businesses can be Wall Street's next stock-split stocks\n\nIt's unlikely that Walmart and Chipotle Mexican Grill are the only high-profile stock splits that are announced this year and into the early portion of 2025. I believe three prominent businesses are poised to follow in Walmart's and Chipotle's footsteps and become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCostco Wholesale\n\nThe first phenomenal company that has the tools and intangibles needed to join an already elite group of stock-split stocks is none other than warehouse club Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST).\n\nNot including the spin-off of Price Enterprises in 1994, Costco has conducted three stock splits, the most recent of which occurred in January 2000. After 24 successful years without a forward split, a single share of Costco Wholesale will set investors back roughly $787.\n\nSimilar to Walmart, Costco has always used its size and deep pockets to its advantage. It purchases its goods in bulk, and therefore enjoys a lower per-unit cost on what it buys. The company is then able to pass along these cost savings to its members and undercut grocers and mom-and-pop shops on price. A consistently lower price for its groceries is a big-time lure for Costco.\n\nCostco's membership model is the other primary reason it's been such a long-term outperformer. The company's $60 and $120 annual membership fees are high margin and can go straight to its bottom line. But more often than not, Costco uses these fees as insulation to ensure that it's undercutting grocery chains and local stores on price.\n\nSomething else a membership does is encourage consumers to remain loyal to Costco. Paying $60 or $120 annually will make members think twice about spending their money elsewhere.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that Costco stock is valued at a historically expensive 45 times forward-year earnings. The company's board might be encouraged to announce a stock split to ignite interest in its shares at such a lofty valuation.\n\nFICO\n\nA second stellar company that can follow Walmart's and Chipotle's path and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is software and analytics provider FICO(NYSE: FICO) (previously known as \"Fair Isaac\").\n\nThe company behind the fabled FICO credit score has completed four stock splits since going public in July 1987. However, the last forward split (a 3-for-2 split) occurred 20 years ago, in March 2004. As of the closing bell on May 10, a single share of FICO was going for almost $1,329!\n\nFICO is the perfect example of a business that's benefited immensely from economic uncertainty. The company's Scores segment provides credit score solutions to businesses to help them make more informed lending decisions. It also offers business-to-consumer solutions, such as its myFICO.com subscription. Through the first six months of its current fiscal year, FICO's business-to-business sales, which comprise more than half of its revenue, soared by 28%.\n\nFICO's Software segment has been no slouch, either. This division, which provides analytics and decision-making solutions to cover customer engagement, fraud detection, marketing, and professional services, enjoyed an 8% sales boost through the first-half of fiscal 2024.\n\nWhat makes FICO a strong candidate for a stock split is the fact that its previous stock splits occurred with the company's shares well below $100. Admittedly, fractional-share purchasing at many online brokers has made a company's share price somewhat of a moot point. But with FICO's stock at its highest nominal share price in history, it's only logical to expect a split sooner than later.\n\nBroadcom\n\nThe third amazing business that can follow in the footsteps of Walmart and Chipotle Mexican Grill and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is semiconductor titan Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO).\n\nPrior to its merger with Avago Technologies in 2016 (Avago kept the Broadcom name), Broadcom had completed three stock splits. However, its new owner since 2016 has never conducted a stock split. A single share of Broadcom will set investors back about $1,333!\n\nBroadcom's outperformance since the curtain opened in 2023 has everything to do with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. In April of last year, the company unveiled its Jericho3-AI chip, which is tasked with seamlessly connecting up to 32,000 AI-accelerating graphics processing units in high-powered data centers. Broadcom has the tools industry-leading businesses will be relying on to train large language models and run generative AI solutions.\n\nBut there's more to Broadcom than just AI. It generates the bulk of its revenue from the sale of wireless chips and accessories found in next-generation smartphones. The rollout of 5G has led to a sustained device replacement cycle that's fueled demand for Broadcom's next-generation wireless solutions and accessories.\n\nAdditionally, Broadcom can enjoy rapid growth potential from its ancillary industrial and automotive segments. It offers connectivity and LED solutions for next-gen vehicles, semiconductor solutions for various medical systems, and optical sensors for industrial automation equipment, to name a few of its ventures.\n\nWith Broadcom's future looking bright, a forward-stock split may be needed to keep shares within reach for investors without access to fractional-share purchases.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Costco Wholesale wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Sweetgreen beats \u2018sad desk salad\u2019 vibes to soar above fast-food competitors. It can thank fancy foods, high prices\u2014and robots",
        "content": "Sweetgreen is proving it\u2019s no sad desk salad company. By leaning into robots, higher prices, and its healthier-than-most reputation, the upscale fast-casual chain just posted an expectation-defying first quarter as it inches toward profitability.\n\nThe company reported Thursday $157.9 million in its first quarter revenue, a 26% increase from its $135.1 million a year ago. Its share price has surged almost 250% in the past six months, to about $32. While it has yet to turn a profit in its 17 years, Sweetgreen narrowed its net loss to $26.1 million, compared to $33.7 million in last year\u2019s first quarter.\n\nFounded in 2007 by Georgetown University alums looking for fast, nutritious food, Sweetgreen has become the go-to lunch spot of the young corporate world, wooing Gen Z and millennial professionals to its $20 salads and bowls through the promise of healthy ingredients and brand deals with celebrities like tennis star Naomi Osaka and influencer Noah Beck.\n\nIn recent months, the chain has rolled out a raft of changes, including eliminating the use of seed oils in favor of avocado and olive oils to align with health trends; introducing grass-fed steak on its menu for the first time to boost dinner sales, and subsequently raising menu prices\u2014adding beef to your salad or grain bowl will cost an additional $6.45.\n\nSweetgreen is among the ranks of other health-branded chain restaurants like Cava and Chipotlewhich have soared thanks to wide profit margins and general interest in fast-casual dining. Meanwhile, fast-food favorites like McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s have struggled to retain their audience of customers looking for affordability, as once-affordable Big Mac meals creep above $18.\n\nBut Sweetgreen can also thank robot automation for its auspicious start to the year. The technology, internally called Infinite Kitchen, can shoot greens, beans, and other toppings into customers\u2019 bowls. So far, it\u2019s in a handful of the chain\u2019s suburban locations and is proving very profitable: Stores with the tech had a first-quarter margin of 28%\u201410 percentage points higher than the company-wide average.\n\nAccording to Neman, the implementation of Infinite Kitchen has helped the company increase order throughput, accuracy, and portion consistency, as well as retain more employees. The company plans to open seven more Infinite Kitchen locations in 2024, as well as retrofit three or four Sweetgreen locations with the technology, starting in New York.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, we have a massive opportunity to bring real food to more communities and disrupt the industry with the rollout of the Infinite Kitchen,\u201d Neman said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustry, disrupted\n\nSweetgreen first began investing in Infinite Kitchen in spring 2023, piloting the automation in two suburban locations. The investment, a hefty $500,000 per store for the technology\u2019s development and installation, saw near immediate returns. In Sweetgreen\u2019s 2023 fourth quarter, the company reported 10% greater ticket sales in Infinite Kitchen locations compared to similar restaurants in the surrounding market.\n\nIf Sweetgreen\u2019s success with Infinite Kitchen is any indication, fast-casual chains are surely more likely to start putting more trust into robot counterparts. In October, Chipotle announced its partnership with Hyphen, a digital platform to automate the creation of salads and bowls, which make up 65% of the chain\u2019s orders.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to have the automated digital makeline be the centerpiece of all our restaurants' digital kitchens,\u201d Curt Garner, Chipotle\u2019s chief customer and technology officer, said.\n\nThe trend of entrusting robots to make fast food is part of an effort to retain employees and save on hefty labor costs, which make up 36% of restaurants\u2019 expenditures. Almost all restaurants have reported labor costs as a concern, according to the National Restaurant Association\u2019s 2024 State of the Restaurant Industry report. With fast-food worker turnover high\u2014and with replacing employees costing restaurants $1,500 per departing employee\u2014chains are eager to retain their workforce. Increased restaurant automation can help relieve employees of tedious tasks in addition to speeding up order fulfillment, taking pressure off busy workers, Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore argued.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, this reallocation benefits the customers, but it also benefits the employee,\u201d she told Fortune in March.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Jack in the Box JACK is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 14, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company\u2019s earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.95.\n\nHow are Estimates Placed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.43 per share, indicating a decline of 2.7% from $1.47 reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nFor revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $369.7 million. The metric suggests a 6.6% decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nJack in the Box\u2019s fiscal second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from menu innovation, focus on delivery channels and marketing strategies. This and strategic investments in store improvements and new store build are likely to have aided restaurant-level economics in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company is focused on addressing opportunities within the breakfast segment, including reintroducing previously removed items. Efforts to enhance breakfast market share involve integrating breakfast into regular marketing activities, introducing innovative breakfast offerings, and experimenting with new promotions, primarily through digital platforms, to attract and re-engage customers. The initiatives are anticipated to have positively influenced the company's performance in the fiscal second quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, soft restaurant contributions due to a decline in transactions and menu mix are likely to have negatively influenced the top line in the fiscal second quarter. Our model predicts restaurant sales and franchise royalties & other revenues to depreciate 13% and 2.4% year over year to $176.2 million and $52.7 million, respectively.\r\n\r\nWage inflation and increases in food and packaging costs and utilities are discouraging. The headwinds are likely to have affected the company\u2019s fiscal second-quarter bottom line on a year-over-year basis.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Jack in the Box this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Jack in the Box has an Earnings ESP of +0.38%.

YUMC reported impressive first-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0Jim Cramer Talks About 10 Consumer Stocks As Americans Push Back on High Prices. If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list,\u00a0click Jim Cramer Talks About 5 Consumer Stocks As Americans Push Back on High Prices.\n\nLast week, Jim Cramer reviewed latest earnings from some of the top retailers and consumer companies in the US and analyzed how Americans are reacting to the ever-increasing pricing pressures. Cramer said that looking at the earnings reported by some retailers so far, it's clear that if you are going to keep prices elevated, you will \"lose customers.\" Cramer said that there are very few retailers who are willing to accept that prices are just \"too darn high.\"\n\nRetail: \"The Ugly Ducking\"\n\nJim Cramer thinks retail is the \"ugly duckling\" when compared to travel and leisure because \"people don\u2019t want to spend money on physical items unless they have to.\" However, the inflation crisis has forced people to be more \"frugal\" according to Cramer, even if it means getting a \"lower quality hamburger or a latte.\"\n\n\"If you acknowledge it without doing anything about it, you are setting yourself up for disappointing numbers going forward,\" Cramer warned retailers.\n\nIn a separate program last week, Cramer said that in the current environment, where many tech stocks are \"treading water,\" investors wonder whether they should sell their current positions and invest in \"passive\" sectors like healthcare, industrials or banks.\n\nCramer Recalls His \"Brutal\" Hedge Fund Days\n\nCramer said back when he was running his hedge fund, he had to review his portfolio \"three times a day\" and defend his stock picks to his then wife Karen Cramer, who was also a half owner of the now-closed Cramer & Co, Cramer's hedge fund.\n\nCramer said that he had to incorporate rate cuts, analyst reports, negative news or valuation concerns while adjusting his portfolio on a daily basis.\n\nIt, according to the CNBC host, was \"brutal\" but \"necessary\" because Cramer and his wife were managing other people's money and they were \"looking over their shoulders.\"\n\nCramer recalled that his ex-wife always insisted on selling \"dead money\" stocks, advocating investing in other stocks that could \"win.\"\n\nCramer Does Not Want You to Sell Your Stocks Based on Market Chatter\n\nWhile all of these practices \"served\" him \"well,\" Cramer said that's not how he manages money at his Charitable Trust. Cramer said without constant criticism on your every move, you can afford to invest in companies that you believe in and \"stick with them as long as the facts don\u2019t fall apart on you.\" However, Cramer noted that sticking to stocks when they are going down is difficult in the short term, but emphasized that stocks suffer selloffs for \"all kinds of reasons.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer said that as long as the basic thesis holds, you should always resist selling your positions no matter what the \"billionaire class\" or \"hedge fund managers\" say. Jim Cramer Talks About 10 Consumer Stocks As Americans Push Back on High Prices\n\nLast week Cramer talked in detail about some consumer stocks, including retail and restaurant companies, and analyzed how inflation is affecting these companies. We picked 10 of these companies and mentioned Cramer's comments about them. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Some top names in the list include McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG). Why is it important to pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nJim Cramer mentioned Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT), the parent company of Chilli's restaurant, as an example of consumer companies managing to grow business despite inflation pressures. According to Cramer Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT) executed a \"barbell\" strategy offering lower price items for more value conscious consumers and premium items for affluent customers.\n\n\"That was a good idea, this stock keeps going higher,\" Cramer added.\n\n9. Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nJim Cramer highlighted that Tyson Foods Inc's (NYSE:TSN) Prepared Foods business has seen about 20% accumulative inflation over the past three years, and it has now become \"too pricey\" for many Americans. In another program earlier this year, Cramer called Tyson a \"horrendous\" stock but still recommended investors to buy.\n\nHe said at the time that the stock was \u201cabout to go up.\u201d Cramer said while input costs in the chicken industry are doing down, we are \u201cabout to have a chicken price explosion.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why doesn\u2019t he like Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) when its margins are going up, Cramer reiterated that he\u2019s actually recommending people to buy the stock; he just wants Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)\u00a0\u00a0to lower chicken prices.\n\nIn addition to TSN, Cramer is also talking about McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG).\n\n8. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 30\n\nJim Cramer said kitchenware and home furnishings company Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) reported some \"excellent\" numbers. Cramer said while Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) is not a cheap retailer as it's regarded as a \"high-quality brand\" and \"that's what people want.\"\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn a strong showing for the Strategy\u2019s consumer discretionary holdings,\u00a0Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM), which sells kitchenware and home furnishings, was the top contributor in the quarter after its August earnings report showed exceptional profitability and the company raised its full-year guidance. Shares jumped further in September after a private equity firm increased its stake, suggesting recent weakness was overdone. The company\u2019s high-quality fundamentals make it a good defensive fit for an uncertain environment: it generates significant free cash flows, has no debt and the liquidity to invest in the business first and then return excess to shareholders.\u201d\n\n7. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nWhen it comes to Yum! Brands, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:YUM), Cramer said the stock got hit despite the fact that Yum! Brands, Inc.'s (NYSE:YUM)\u00a0Taco Bell brand offered very cheap options. Some other segments of Yum! Brands, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:YUM)\u00a0were not able to offset inflation-related headwinds with low-price offers though, according to Cramer. In November 2023, Cramer highlighted that the market was focusing too much on Pizza Hut and ignoring KFC and Taco-Bell, which he believed are Yum! Brands, Inc.'s (NYSE:YUM)\u00a0strengths.\n\nLike YUM, Cramer is also talking about McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG).\n\nThe company in its Q1 earnings call talked about guidance and the state of business:\n\n\"With the KFC UK deal behind us, our cash balance will return to a normalized rate of around $400 million, excluding the unrepatriated Devyani proceeds. Thereafter, with no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we plan to use our excess free cash flow primarily to fund share repurchases, absent accretive investments we choose to make. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Subsequent to the quarter end, we renewed our pro rata credit facility, including our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A. We were pleased to renew the $2 billion facility with the same pricing and terms that we achieved in 2021 while also increasing the revolver from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion.\n\nNow let me discuss our latest outlook on full year 2024. We are confident that 2024 will showcase a strong unit development story at or above 5% unit growth, led by KFC International as franchisees capitalize on our brand\u2019s attractive paybacks. In the U.S., Taco Bell continues to balance core everyday value to cater to a more discerning consumer across income groups with premium innovation to attract new consumers. We expect full year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Excluding the 53rd week, we now expect ex special G&A to be flat to down slightly for the year, including incremental G&A associated with the KFC UK acquisition. Finally, we are confident we will deliver at least 8% core operating profit growth excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Macy's, Inc (NYSE:M)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 36\n\nJim Cramer said he finds Macy's, Inc (NYSE:M) as the \"most intriguing\" stock among the retail stock universe. Macy's, Inc (NYSE:M) has added two new board members to avoid a proxy fight with Arkhouse Management. Cramer wondered whether this appointment would thwart the $24 bid to takeover Macy's. Cramer said he's \"guessing\" that Macy's, Inc (NYSE:M) would be given time to \"work it magic.\"\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Talks About 5 Consumer Stocks As Americans Push Back on High Prices.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Says \u201cHang On To Stocks\u201d and Recommends 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks Heading Into May 2024 Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\nDisclosure.None.

        "title": "GOOG Stock Analysis: Unlocking the Future Potential of Alphabet in 2024",
        "content": "Bill Ackman, hedge fund manager, advocates owning a small group of stocks. He\u2019s willing to ride these best ideas for years. One of those best ideas is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Pershing Square Capital Management owns 9.38 million Class C and 4.35 million Class A shares. Together, Pershing has nearly $2 billion in Alphabet stock.\n\nAckman\u2019s stake in Google\u2019s parent company accounts for more than 18.5% of his firm\u2019s $10.4 billion in assets reported in its Q4 2023 13-F. With the two share classes combined, Alphabet is Pershing\u2019s second-highest holding by percentage, surpassed only by Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) at just less than 19%.\n\nExcept for Lowe\u2019s Companies (NYSE:LOW), each of Pershing\u2019s seven holdings has a weighting of at least 11%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou could argue that Alphabet stock should be the hedge fund\u2019s largest position. Here\u2019s why.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Alphabet Stock\n\nThrough Q1 2024, Alphabet\u2019s trailing 12-month free cash flow was $69.11 billion, 21.7% of its $318.15 billion in revenue. Adding up the trailing 12-month free cash flow of Pershing\u2019s other six holdings, it comes to $11.88 billion, or about one-sixth Alphabet\u2019s.\n\nBased on the other six\u2019s combined revenue of $129.08 billion, the average margin is 9.2%, less than half of Alphabet\u2019s.\n\nFree Cash Flow Margins \u2014 Pershing Square Capital Management Holdings\n\nCompany Free Cash Flow (TTM) Revenue (TTM) Margin Alphabet $69.11 billion $318.15 billion 21.7% QSR International $1.25 billion $7.17 billion 17.4% Lowe\u2019s Companies $6.18 billion $86.38 billion 7.2% Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) $1.32 billion $10.20 billion 12.9% Hilton Hotels (NYSE:HLT) $1.74 billion $10.52 billion 16.5% Howard Hughes Holdings (NYSE:HHH) -$266 million $999 million N/A Canadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE:CP) $1.65 billion $13.81 billion 11.9%\n\nAll the other holdings possess healthy free cash flow, except for Howard Hughes, a real estate developer who doesn\u2019t focus on this financial metric. You can\u2019t go out of business if you bring in more cash than you send out.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Pershing cut its Lowe\u2019s holdings by 82%. Ackman likely left some money on the table as LOW stock hit a 52-week high of $262.49 in March. I would not be surprised if Pershing sold out of its Lowe\u2019s position in the first quarter, given it paid an average of $100.43 a share.\n\nIf you take out Lowe\u2019s numbers, the free cash flow margin for the other five stocks jumps to 13.3% [free cash flow of $5.70 billion divided by $42.70 billion], 840 basis points less than Alphabet.\n\nThere is no question that Alphabet is the best free cash flow generator.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Does It Compare to the Other Magnificent 7 Stocks?\n\nThere are 64 analysts covering GOOG/GOOGL stock, with 50 rating it a Buy with a $195 target price, 14% higher than where it currently trades. So, that\u2019s 78% of analysts rating it a Buy.\n\nHere\u2019s how it compares to the other Mag 7 stocks.\n\nAnalyst Buy Rating Percentages \u2014 Magnificent 7 Stocks\n\nCompany # of Analysts  Buy Rating % Alphabet 64 78% Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 46 65% Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 59 95% Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 65 97% Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 59 88% Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) 51 41% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) 67 85%\n\nAt least from the perspective of analysts, Alphabet is not the favorite Mag 7 stock.\n\nI won\u2019t review all the free cash flow margins for the other six Mag 7 stocks. However, Amazon, which has the highest Buy percentage at 97%, has a free cash flow margin of 7.7% based on $45.70 billion in TTM free cash flow and $590.74 billion in revenue.\n\nIn fairness to Amazon, if you exclude its e-commerce revenue, the free cash flow generation is much stronger. With all it has going with its ad business and AI, its free cash in about five years will be considerably more impressive. It\u2019s not hard to see why so many analysts rate it a buy.\n\nNext up is Microsoft, which has a 95% Buy percentage. It\u2019s more of an apples-to-apples comparison. Its free cash flow margin is 29.8% based on $70.58 billion in TTM free cash flow and $236.58 billion in revenue.\n\nSatya Nadella is one of the best CEOs in America. Since taking the helm on Feb. 4, 2014, MSFT stock is up 1020%, 544 percentage points higher than Alphabet over the same period.\n\nMSFT is the class of the Mag 7.\n\nThe Bottom Line on GOOG Stock\n\nLast December, I wrote about how Alphabet was spending money in all the wrong places. Notably, it had repurchased more than $100 billion of its stock over the previous two years. And while its underperforming shares made some buybacks worthwhile, it should have invested at least 50% of these funds in its business.\n\nThe company\u2019s employees are fed up with shareholders getting all the benefits of its strong free cash flow.\n\n\u201cDespite the company\u2019s stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases,\u201d Fortune reportedCNBC comments made by an employee after the company\u2019s blowout quarter. \u201cWhen will employee compensation fairly reflect the company\u2019s success and is there a conscious decision to keep wages lower due to a cooling employment market?\u201d\n\nIf you can only buy one Mag 7 stock, Microsoft is the call. However, Alphabet\u2019s free cash flow always keeps it in the mix.\n\nAlphabet is a Moderate Buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "You don\u2019t need a lot of money to invest in the stock market. It\u2019s possible to buy fractional shares with as little as $1. However, investors who can put more money into the stock market have the potential to realize higher gains.\n\nPortfolios compound over time, especially if you pick the right investments. An annualized 8% growth rate can have a significant impact on your finances when you stretch your time horizon to multiple decades. While index funds can offer solid returns, investors may also want to consider these hot stocks if they have $1,000 ready to invest. These are the best stocks to buy right now.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers a healthy sports drink that doesn\u2019t have any sugar, high fructose corn syrup or similar unhealthy ingredients. Instead of using those ingredients, the beverage offers plenty of caffeine.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe formula has worked well for the corporation. Revenue surged by 95% year-over-year in Q4 2023, while net income came in at $39.1 million. The company reported $28.2 million in net losses in the same period last year.\n\nCelsius Holdings generates most of its sales in North America. International markets represent relatively untapped opportunities, and the company is making strides in those segments. International sales should grow at a high rate for multiple years and support a higher stock price.\n\nThe average price target suggests a 14% upside from current levels. Celsius Holdings is rated as a Strong Buy among 11 analysts. The stock has gained 52% year-to-date and is in the middle of a correction. Shares are up by more than 5,000% over the past five years.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) offers a reasonable valuation and strong financials. The stock trades at a 19 P/E ratio and offers a 1.2% yield. Shares are up by 28% year-to-date and have gained 105% over the past five years.\n\nThe fintech firm exceeded previous guidance in the first quarter of 2024. Revenue growth came in at 11% year-over-year (YoY), which wasn\u2019t a big shock, but 34% YoY net income growth is significant. American Express suggested it will achieve revenue growth ranging from 9% to 11% per year beyond 2026. The firm also established a mid-teens growth rate for EPS. The 39% YoY diluted EPS growth rate exceeded the target.\n\nConsumers will continue to use credit and debit cards in any economy. American Express makes a small percentage of each transaction. However, it isn\u2019t only older generations that use AMEX cards. The firm reported that 60% of the people who became cardholders in the first quarter were Millennials or Gen Z consumers. A younger core audience will help American Express deliver more growth in the years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has established itself as a fast food leader. The company offers healthier alternatives than most of its competitors, and customers keep coming back for more. Price hikes and higher costs aren\u2019t stopping people from visiting Chipotle stores.\n\nThe fast food restaurant chain reported 14.1% YoY revenue growth in Q1 2024. The company opened 47 new restaurants in the quarter and included a Chipotlane in 43 locations. The bottom line grew at an even faster rate. Diluted earnings per share increased by 23.9% YoY. Leadership has a long-term target of more than doubling its business in North America and expanding internationally.\n\nChipotle is still on pace to open 285 to 315 new restaurants in 2024. The stock\u2019s 42% year-to-date performance suggests it is also on pace to outperform the stock market. Looking from a wider lens, investors will notice the stock has more than quadrupled over the past five years. Rising profit margins can enable more growth for long-term investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in CELH.

        "title": "At US$3,233, Is It Time To Put Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) On Your Watch List?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s examine Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nIs Chipotle Mexican Grill Still Cheap?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 68.5x is currently well-above the industry average of 19.22x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCan we expect growth from Chipotle Mexican Grill? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Chipotle Mexican Grill. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in CMG\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe CMG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on CMG for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for CMG, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill you should know about.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Chipotle Mexican Grill, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) has been one of the most reliable growth stocks on the market since its IPO in 2006.\n\nWith the exception of the three-year period when the company's performance was marred by an E. coli outbreak, Chipotle has delivered solid growth year in and year out.\n\nThe company recently announced a 50-for-1 stock split, rewarding longtime shareholders with an upcoming reset in the stock price as the stock has been more than a 50-bagger since its IPO. Image source: Chipotle\n\nChipotle's five-year performance\n\nOver the last five years, Chipotle shares have jumped an impressive 346%. As the chart below shows, much of those gains have come in the last six months or so, helped in part by the stock-split announcement.

        "title": "Meet the Stock-Split Stock That Makes Up 23% of Billionaire Bill Ackman's $11 Billion Portfolio",
        "content": "When it comes to hedge fund managers, Bill Ackman is in a class by himself. He etched his name into Wall Street history by going against hedge fund norms, acquiring significant stakes in just a few companies, and holding them for the long term. Furthermore, as a well-known activist investor, those stakes sometimes involve troubled businesses and he pressures management to make changes that positively impact shareholder value.\n\nAckman heads up Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund he founded, which has more than $11.3 billion in assets under management. Pershing typically holds between eight and 12 large-cap North American companies. To make the cut they must be high quality, have limited downside, and generate predictable, recurring cash flows. This playbook has been extremely successful for Ackman as Pershing Square has returned 31% annualized over the past five years, nearly twice the returns of the S&P 500.\n\nTo close out 2023, Pershing Square held stakes in just eight stocks, but one stands head and shoulders above the rest. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLet the \"chips\" fall where they may\n\nBy far, the largest holding in Pershing Square's portfolio is Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Ackman has amassed nearly 825,000 shares currently worth more than $2.6 billion, making up a massive 23% of his portfolio.\n\nNot only is Chipotle one of the most well-known companies in the world, but it's also among the most successful. Since the company's debut in 2006, the stock surged from just $22 to roughly $3,200 as of this writing, generating returns of 14,441%.\n\nIn late March, Chipotle announced that its board of directors had approved a 50-for-1 stock split, making it \"one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) history.\" The split will require the approval of shareholders when Chipotle conducts its annual meeting on June 6. If the measure is approved, and there's no reason to believe otherwise, each shareholder of record will receive 49 additional shares for every one they hold after the market close on June 25.\n\nFor context, instead of owing one share worth $3,200, investors will own 50 shares worth $64 each.\n\nWhy Ackman singled out Chipotle\n\nAckman has chosen just eight stocks to make up Pershing Square's $11 billion portfolio, so it's already a rare company that makes the cut. He first added shares of Chipotle in 2016 after the fast-casual pioneer suffered from a rash of food safety issues that sent diners and investors alike packing, and the stock price was cut in half.\n\nYet, where some investors saw risk, Ackman saw opportunity -- partially thanks to his long-term outlook. Pershing Square's most recent annual report cited Chipotle's \"continued focus on exceptional food and operational excellence\" as the catalyst for its robust growth. The report also noted Chipotle's \"industry-leading same-store sales growth and profitability.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAckman is clearly on to something. In the first quarter -- even as rivals dealt with headwinds -- Chipotle's revenue increased 14% to $2.7 billion, driven higher by comparable restaurant sales that jumped 7%. The company's operating margin and restaurant-level operating margin both edged higher thanks to Chipotle's fiscal discipline. Perhaps more impressive was the company's profits, as adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 27% to $13.37.\n\nChipotle \"has a long runway for robust growth,\" according to Ackman. He cites the company's ability to consistently improve same-store sales and profitability, which is clear from its recent results. He also points to as-yet untapped growth in North America, given Chipotle's plans to increase its location county by 8% to 10% annually. That's not to mention the ongoing international expansion, which includes growth across Europe and a recently inked franchise agreement to expand into the Middle East.\n\nFinally, in its annual report, Pershing called out the success of CEO Brian Niccol, writing, \"Chipotle stock is up more than 10-fold since Brian became CEO in March 2018. What more can we say?\" High praise indeed, coming from one of the world's most successful hedge funds.\n\nIs Chipotle stock a buy now?\n\nChipotle has already notched impressive gains thus far in 2024, with the stock up 40% year to date (as of this writing), on top of 65% gains last year. As a result, the stock is somewhat pricey, currently selling for 58 times forward earnings and nearly 7 times forward sales. A valuation of that magnitude suggests investors have high expectations built into the stock price. If Chipotle fails to live up to those expectations, the stock could fall.\n\nThat said, for investors with a long investing time horizon, Chipotle still bears all the attributes of a long-term winner. Given the company's track record of performance and its ongoing expansion opportunities, the evidence suggests that five to 10 years from now, we could be having this discussion about Chipotle's merits again.\n\nFor investors that simply can't stomach buying the stock at its current multiple, add it to your watch list and buy on any weakness.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Recession-Resistant Retail: 3 Stocks to Weather the Economic Storm",
        "content": "Economists are divided on the question of when, or if, a recession will occur. Some even support\u00a0the argument that we\u2019ve been in a rolling recession. Whatever your thoughts on the matter, the fact that a potential recession is still being discussed should put you on the hunt for recession-proof retail stocks.\n\nOf course, the retail sector has been under pressure for well over a year. However, it\u2019s only been in the last two quarters that many retailers are acknowledging consumer pullback. Still, shifting consumer buying habits, in this case, means they\u2019re being more selective.\n\nAnd that means investors need to be more selective as well. The playbook is not new. You\u2019re looking for companies that are growing earnings and ones that analysts support. Here are three recession-proof retail stocks that you can buy for the short term or the long haul.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt may be strange to say a stock that\u2019s up 353% in the last five years and will soon be conducting a 50-for-1 stock split is undervalued. But that may very well be the case with Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).\n\nChipotle indeed trades at 58x forward earnings. But long-term investors are banking on the fact that Chipotle\u2019s aggressive international expansion will allow the stock to grow into that valuation. The latest move that Chipotle made on that front was its partnership with the Alshaya Group to debut the brand in Kuwait.\n\nBack in the United States, the company just reported first-quarter earnings that were exceptional by any measure. The results are noteworthy at a time when many consumers are eating at home to avoid the high cost of dining out.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a position in CMG stock, you\u2019ll probably want to wait until after the stock split which will be effective June 18, 2024, pending shareholder approval.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) Costco logo on a sign on a Costco store.\n\nSource: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of stocks that have done well over the last five years, Costco Wholesale\u2019s (NASDAQ:COST) stock is up 212% in the last five years. And the stock is already up 16% in 2024. Analysts indicate that the stock may be due for a pullback. But with 19 out of 38 analysts giving COST stock a strong buy or buy rating, investors should view that as a buying signal.\n\nThe company has noticed that consumers are prioritizing staple items over discretionary purchases. However, the company continues to deliver year-over-year revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe company\u2019s business model is based on its membership model. Once consumers pay the membership fee, they\u2019re going to prioritize shopping at Costco. Costco hasn\u2019t increased its membership fee since 2017.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt hasn\u2019t announced that it will raise the fee, but based on history, it\u2019s overdue. In the past, when the company increased its membership fee, it had little to no impact on the company\u2019s membership numbers. Costco also plans to continue opening new locations both in the United States and abroad which provides another avenue for growth.\n\nChewy (CHWY) The Chewy logo on a banner at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: Chie Inoue / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite its niche in the pet care and wellness industry, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) has lagged behind many retail stocks. In the last five years, CHWY stock is down 55%, and it\u2019s down 33% in 2024.\n\nThe current issue is a lack of meaningful growth. CHWY stock soared nearly 4x in 2020 as more consumers brought pets into their homes. The company benefited from an e-commerce model that consumers needed. Unfortunately, Chewy wasn\u2019t able to leverage that bottom-line growth as the economy reopened.\n\nBut analysts now view Chewy stock as oversold. Price targets range from $16 to $32 with the consensus being $22.80 which would be a 47% gain. \u00a0As analyst sentiment improves, short interest is declining, and institutional ownership is on the rise.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "CAVA Group (NYSE:CAVA): Investors\u2019 Appetite for the Salad Chain Is Growing",
        "content": "After Mediterranean-themed restaurant CAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) served up strong growth last year, investors are hoping for a second course in 2024. Shares of the fast-casual chain hit a fresh record high of $77.14 on Monday, less than a year after opening at an IPO price of $42.00. The mid-cap high-flier is up more than 70% year-to-date and is showing no sign of slowing down.\n\nCAVA Group is an up-and-coming restaurant operator that is based in Washington, D.C. Boldly going head-to-head with Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), it offers a variety of heart-healthy Mediterranean bowls and pitas at locations across the United States.\n\nCAVA Group stock is currently on an impressive seven-month win streak on the backs of some strong 2023 financials. In a tough discretionary spending environment, the company grew revenue and same-restaurant sales by 60% and 18%, respectively, last year. It is not only growing by expanding its footprint but also by generating higher sales at existing locations.\n\nIn addition to producing strong top-line growth, CAVA Group is already profitable. The company has recorded profits in each of the first three quarters since going public in June 2023. It is also three-for-three in surpassing Wall Street\u2019s earnings estimates.\n\nI am optimistic about CAVA Group\u2019s potential to replicate its above-industry growth, going forward. The restaurant chain has created a niche category within the fast-growing limited-service restaurant space. Its food matches consumers\u2019 increasing demand for healthy protein, vegetables, and fruits as part of broader U.S. health and wellness trends. By the second half of this year, CAVA Group plans to have steak on the menu at all locations.\n\nCAVA Group is poised to build off its recent success by staying in tune with customer preferences and opening many new stores.\n\nAggressive Store Expansion\n\nIn 2023, CAVA Group opened 72 new restaurants, a 30% increase from 2022. This was a gutsy move, considering inflation and elevated credit card rates had big impacts on American discretionary budgets. The company is doubling down on its aggressive expansion strategy. It expects to build 48 to 52 more restaurants this year to bring its total unit count to at least 357. This may only be the beginning.\n\nCAVA Group ended 2023 with 309 restaurants across 24 U.S. states. Management believes the company is in the early stages of expansion and has the potential to top 1,000 locations by 2032. The company generally targets upper-middle-income households in highly populated urban and suburban settings. Catering to higher-earning consumers definitely played a role in last year\u2019s outperformance, and this makes CAVA Group a relatively economy-proof restaurant stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Midwest U.S. is expected to be a focus area for 2024 expansion. This plan was confirmed on April 26 when CAVA Group opened its first Chicago-area location. It marked the chain\u2019s first step into the upper Midwest market. The Southeastern and Southwestern U.S. is where CAVA Group has its largest presence, with more than 130 locations.\n\nLater this month, we\u2019ll learn if the company\u2019s growth strategy is off to a good start this year. CAVA Group is scheduled to announce 2024 first-quarter financial results after the market closes on May 28. In the fourth quarter of 2023, higher premium item orders and moderating input costs led to a surprise profit. The current consensus estimate for 2024 first-quarter EPS is $0.03.\n\nIs CAVA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nDespite the stock\u2019s strong year-to-date performance, Wall Street research firms remain mostly bullish on CAVA Group. In the past three months, the stock has received eight Buy ratings and three Hold ratings.\n\nLast month, Argus Research analyst Christine Dooley upgraded CAVA Group from Hold to Buy. Dooley pounced on the sell-off from a 52-week high to raise her rating, saying the restaurant \u201chas a long runway to growth.\u201d\n\nAlso last month, Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan kept a Buy rating on CAVA Group. Setyan similarly thinks the company is well-positioned for long-term growth driven by store expansion, menu innovation, digital initiatives, and a revamped loyalty program. The analyst set a Street-high $74.00 price target on CAVA.\n\nWhat Is the Consensus Price Target for CAVA Stock?\n\nCAVA Group shares have already exceeded Wall Street\u2019s highest price target of $74.00. Meanwhile, the latest CAVA stock consensus price target is $63.82, which implies 13.9% downside from current levels. This could mean CAVA is due for a pullback. On the other hand, another strong earnings report could cause analysts to boost their price targets.\n\nThe Bottom Line on CAVA Stock\n\nCAVA Group shares have more than doubled from their October 2023 low due to better-than-expected earnings releases and a bright long-term growth outlook. As the company\u2019s aggressive expansion story plays out, growth metrics could continue to impress. The stock appears overheated in the near term, though, so waiting for a dip may suit bullish investors.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "After people buy the essentials, some of their money goes toward discretionary spending. These extra purchases fuel the economy and create many jobs, but the best consumer stocks to buy can also lead to long-term wealth.\n\nBusinesses have been jostling for market share and trying to attract higher percentages of consumer spending. Some corporations have established themselves as industry leaders and regularly generate additional revenue and profits.\n\nSome consumer stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years. These are some of the picks investors may want to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) combines low prices with an array of products. The retailer is the world\u2019s leading grocer, which makes it resilient to economic downturns. The company\u2019s affordability can make it more attractive to consumers as the costs of goods and services continue to rise.\n\nThe company reported 5.7% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 FY24. Advertising and e-commerce exhibited impressive growth rates, and recent investments suggest Walmart is emphasizing these segments. The recent acquisition of Vizio Holdings demonstrates Walmart\u2019s desire to expand in advertising. Ads have higher profit margins than retail sales but currently make up a sliver of Walmart\u2019s total sales.\n\nWalmart is up by 13% year-to-date and has gained 76% over the past five years. It has a 31 P/E ratio and offers a 1.39% yield. Analysts have rated the stock a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d and believe it can gain an additional 10% from current levels.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has pricing power due to its focus on healthy food and ingredients. While most fast-food restaurant giants are losing consumers, Chipotle didn\u2019t have that issue in the first quarter of 2024. During that quarter, revenue increased by 14.1% year-over-year, while diluted EPS jumped by 23.9% year-over-year.\n\nChipotle opened 47 new restaurants in the quarter and remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants in 2024. The fast food restaurant chain included a Chipotlane in 43 of the 47 new restaurants. Chipotlanes has been effective at generating digital sales and increasing restaurant efficiency.\n\nShares are up by 43% year-to-date and have soared by 353% over the past five years. Chipotle recently announced a 50-for-1 stock split that will make shares more affordable. The bid can increase employee retention, and it should also stimulate options trading activity. Options traders don\u2019t have a way to trade fractional contracts, so reducing the share price will make options contracts more affordable.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s most recognizable online marketplace. The company continues to post record sales and delivers impressive results for its investors.\n\nThe tech conglomerate reported 13% year-over-year net sales growth in Q1 2024. The online marketplace was a decisive component of the company\u2019s $143.3 billion quarter. However, that wasn\u2019t the only proponent that drove the stock higher. Amazon Web Services revenue reached $25.0 billion, which was 17% higher than in the same period last year. Advertising, grocery sales, subscriptions and artificial intelligence also contributed to the company\u2019s net sales.\n\nNet income more than tripled year-over-year to reach $10.4 billion. With other tech giants offering dividends, it may only be a matter of time before Amazon offers a dividend for its investors. However, analysts aren\u2019t waiting for the corporation to issue a dividend to get on board the rally train. The average price target suggests a 16% gain from current levels. Amazon is currently rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 41 analysts.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AMZN.

Given the high volatility in the stock market over the past few weeks, investors are looking for sectors other than technology.\u00a0An\u00a0improvement in the economy\u00a0is directly related\u00a0to consumer spending\u00a0and\u00a0some of the best restaurant stocks will be the first\u00a0ones\u00a0to benefit.\n\nHaving shown resilience throughout the high inflation\u00a0periods, restaurant stocks have been standing\u00a0strong. Consumer spending at restaurants increased in 2023\u00a0as\u00a0compared to the prior year\u00a0and\u00a0I believe this improvement will continue throughout 2024. I have chosen the best restaurant stocks to buy and hold for long-term gains. These are exceptional companies with a global presence and have already impressed investors with solid fundamentals.\n\nTake a bite of these delicious restaurant stocks this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s\u00a0(MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile the\u00a0first-quarter results didn\u2019t\u00a0do much good to McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD)\u00a0stock, there is a reason to bet your money on it. The fast food giant has become one of the best-known global names\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0is reporting steady growth.\u00a0Its revenue increased 5%\u00a0in the quarter\u00a0to $6.2 billion\u00a0and\u00a0the adjusted EPS increased 2% to $2.70.\u00a0The global comparable sales increased by 1.9%.\n\nThe company has been making changes in its offerings\u00a0and\u00a0this has led\u00a0to success since the beginning of the year.\u00a0It has improved the\u00a0quality\u00a0and\u00a0taste\u00a0and also enhanced\u00a0delivery services.\u00a0Since the management saw a drop in traffic to its restaurants, it will have to remain vigilant about the prices.\u00a0An improvement in consumer spending, however,\u00a0could help the business see higher revenue growth.\n\nIf you look at the bigger picture,\u00a0McDonald\u2019s\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0have much to worry about. Its franchise income is steadily growing\u00a0and\u00a0the company\u00a0is aiming\u00a0to test a\u00a0larger\u00a0burger this year. With\u00a0strong\u00a0fundamentals and a global presence, MCD will continue to stand tall in the competitive industry.\n\nTrading at $269 today, the stock is down 9% year-to-date. It enjoys a dividend yield of 2.48% and is an ideal stock for passive income investors. If you found MCD expensive earlier, now is your time to pounce on this restaurant stock. The stock has also suffered due to the Israel-Hamas conflict and the boycotts in the region. However, the pullback in the stock is a chance to make your move.\n\nStory continues\n\nDomino\u2019s\u00a0Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nA clear winner of the earnings season,\u00a0Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ)\u00a0 had an excellent quarter despite the inflation concerns. The first-quarter results beat analyst estimates as the company reported a revenue of $1.08 billion. Its EPS stood at $3.58\u00a0and\u00a0the sales increased 6% YoY.\u00a0 Its quarterly net income grew 20% YoY to $126 million.\u00a0The same-store sales\u00a0grew\u00a05.6% in the U.S.\u00a0and\u00a0this growth was\u00a0driven by delivery orders.\n\nThe strong results led the stock up 6%\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0is now trading for $522, up 16% YTD and 69% in the past 12 months.\u00a0It has been slowly but steadily moving upwards\u00a0and has gone from\u00a0$308 to $522 today.\u00a0I\u2019d\u00a0recommended\u00a0buying the stock in September\u00a0and\u00a0if you had bought it\u00a0then,\u00a0you would be sitting on gains of 32%.\n\nIts pricing techniques and menu offerings make it possible for the company to achieve positive same-store sales growth and see higher revenue numbers. The company saw a\u00a0strong\u00a0improvement in sales at over 20,000 outlets globally and aims to open 1,100 stores by 2028. An increase in stores will lead to an improvement in sales and revenue in the coming years.\n\nIts marketing efforts with the improved loyalty program are paying off in addition to the quick service time that helped increase orders.\u00a0Yes, the stock\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0cheap and is trading at a premium today\u00a0but\u00a0if you wait for it to dip, you could be waiting forever. DPZ stock has a dividend yield of 1.16%.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMy all-time favorite restaurant stock to own, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG),\u00a0will not disappoint you.\u00a0Trading at $3,199 today, the stock is up 42% YTD and 57% in the past 12 months. The\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0first-quarter results were mind-blowing, and it has announced a stock split of 50-for-1\u00a0which\u00a0has made it even more attractive.\n\nThe stock will split on June 25\u00a0and\u00a0the shares will start trading on June 26.\u00a0This\u00a0was an attempt to make the stock appealing to investors, and with the stock trading over $3,000, this was\u00a0a\u00a0necessary\u00a0move.\u00a0This\u00a0is another stock I had\u00a0recommended buying in October when it was trading for $1,837. You could be sitting on 74% gains today.\n\nThe company saw a 14% increase in sales to $2.7 billion, and comparable sales rose 7%. The company is\u00a0making an entry in\u00a0Kuwait in a partnership with Alshaya Group to launch its first shop. A timely move, the Middle East brings massive expansion opportunities for Chipotle.\n\nThe company has put up monster returns in the past\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0can do so again. It has impressed the market\u00a0and\u00a0the stock split could be a good chance\u00a0for you\u00a0to add the stock to your portfolio. The stock will trade at a lower value after the split.\n\nWhile it will make no difference to the shareholder value, it will become more affordable. It is trading close to $3,000 today\u00a0and\u00a0after the split, it could be trading near $60. I love the stock and think\u00a0that the\u00a0split is\u00a0a good\u00a0opportunity to add it to your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best large-cap growth ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, head over to 5 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.\n\nLarge-cap growth funds focus on investing in big companies, those in the top 70% in terms of market value. Growth funds constitute companies expected to grow their revenue or earnings faster than their peers or the overall market. They are often seen as risky but can be good for investors who are not risk averse and prefer long-term investments.\n\nTom Hancock, who heads focused equity at GMO, joined CNBC\u2019s ETF Edge on November 15, 2023, and remarked that the growth trade momentum is aided by the leadership of mega-cap tech companies that are embracing artificial intelligence. Similarly, Nathan Geraci, president of The ETF Store, agreed with Hancock's observation but noted that only a couple of stocks are leading the growth outperformance. In his words, Geraci commented:\n\n\u201cA lot of growth performance this year has been driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven, because if you look at many of the growth indices, they\u2019re pretty top-heavy. The largest growth companies have been enough to really drive that performance differential versus value.\u201d\n\nCurrently, US small-cap stocks are experiencing their toughest period compared to larger companies in over two decades. This reflects the investor preference for mega-cap tech stocks while smaller players grapple with inflated interest rates. According to a Financial Times report, the Russell 2000 index has seen a 24% increase since the start of 2020, significantly trailing behind the S&P 500's impressive 60% surge during the same period. This deviation from historical norms, where smaller, fast-growing companies typically offer higher returns despite higher volatility, underscores the current market dynamics. Greg Tuorto, a small-cap portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, pointed out the lack of significant investment in the small-cap space since 2016 or 2017, highlighting the need for increased market enthusiasm, perhaps through M&A activity or a flourishing IPO market, to reignite small-cap growth. While there are indications of the equity market expanding beyond tech giants, persistent inflation and a strong job market have led traders to accept the likelihood of higher interest rates for longer than previously anticipated. In a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains or even raises rates, smaller companies with significant short-term or floating-rate debt, like those in the Russell 2000, are likely to be most affected.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther making a positive case for large-cap ETFs compared to their small-cap counterparts, an academic research paper took a close look at 66 large-cap and 34 small-cap ETFs listed in the United States from 2012 to 2016, covering the full trading history of these funds. The author chose to focus on the US market because it is a major player globally, and he wanted a robust sample size for the analysis. The study partially confirms what's known as the \"size effect\". Essentially, small-cap ETFs showed better returns compared to large-cap ETFs when looking at both raw and adjusted numbers. However, it is not all smooth sailing for small caps \u2013 they come with higher risk, which does not quite balance out the gains. Plus, this outperformance is not consistent year after year. When adjusted for risk, small-cap ETFs actually fall behind their larger counterparts. The same trend holds true when comparing the performance rankings of large-cap and small-cap ETFs.\n\nSome of the best large-cap growth ETFs include Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG), Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VUG), and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). These funds expose investors to growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of May 3, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance.

First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 69.29%\n\nFirst Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) aims to mirror the performance of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Growth Index. It seeks to achieve similar investment outcomes in terms of both price and yield, excluding fees and expenses. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)\u2019s net expense ratio stands at 0.60% as of December 1, 2023. As of May 2, 2024, the fund\u2019s net assets exceed $1 billion, and its portfolio comprises 187 holdings, excluding cash. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to monitor.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is one of the top holdings of First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC). According to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds held stakes in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square is the leading position holder in the company, with a stake worth $1.88 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a popular stock among elite hedge funds.\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAmong our top Q1 contributors were Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), Shockwave Medical and Spotify. Chipotle\u2019s combination of superior quality and speed of service has created a strong brand affinity, and the company is currently expanding its store count at a growth rate of 8%\u201310% annually. With each restaurant generating an annual income of around 60% of its original investment cost, the implied payback period is less than two years. Given these attractive economics, we believe a long runway remains for market penetration potential. Next, increased accessibility and convenience have been a strategic priority, leading it to add secondary \u201cmake lines\u201d that enable each store to meet increased demand from third-party delivery services and the company\u2019s own digital pickup lanes (\u201cChipotlanes\u201d). And last, evidence is emerging that the company\u2019s post-COVID training initiatives (\u201cthe four pillars of throughput\u201d) are resulting in higher peak-time productivity. Overall, the profit cycle remains nicely in motion, and the stock remains a large CropSM holding.\u201d\n\n11. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 81.23%\n\niShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) ranks 11th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) aims to replicate the performance of S&P 900 Growth Index, which consists of large and mid-cap US stocks known for their growth potential.

The fund features a portfolio comprising 473 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.04%.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) occupies the largest position in iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)\u2019s portfolio.

The company also designs, manufactures, and sells devices, including PCs, tablets, and gaming/entertainment consoles that all integrate with Azure, its cloud computing service. In the quarter Microsoft\u2019s stock appreciated based on excitement surrounding the company\u2019s positioning in the generative AI market and its ability to monetize the coming wave of corporate investment in supercomputing and AI, which will be through both Azure and Microsoft Copilot, the company\u2019s new GenAI personal assistant.\u201d\n\n10. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 82.91%\n\niShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) is placed 10th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) seeks to replicate the performance of S&P 500(R) Growth Index, which is composed of large-cap US stocks known for their growth potential.

The company also sells several high-margin consumer services including Advertising, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Digital Content and Payment Services. The stock\u2019s underperformance during the quarter was due to fears that the company\u2019s slowing top-line growth and increased competitive threats make the stock\u2019s premium valuation harder to justify.\u201d\n\n9. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 83.73%\n\nVanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) invests in stocks from the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Growth Index. Its primary objective is to closely mirror the returns of this index, which is considered a benchmark for overall US growth stock performance. The ETF was established on September 7, 2010. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) features an expense ratio of 0.10% and its portfolio comprises 228 stocks. As of March 31, 2024, VOOG\u2019s net assets came in at $10.3 billion.\n\nSemiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the top holdings of Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG). As per Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was found in 173 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 180 in the earlier quarter. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners is one of the largest stakeholders of NVIDIA, with 13.90 million shares worth $6.88 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThis quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much of the focus is on Nvidia\u2019s market cap reaching $2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the company\u2019s valuation has actually come down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares to today, where the company is being valued at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is actually expanding faster than valuation). While competitors are working to enter the GPU space, Nvidia has created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) was a top performer in the quarter gaining 82.5% in the period. While the company has had an impressive run, gaining 242% over the last year, the valuation has been supported by the impressive growth in Revenue (126%), EPS (392%) and free cash flow (610%) over the last year. The company has solidified its position in the GPU space supported by its proprietary software CUDA. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d\n\n8. iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 92.31%\n\niShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG) seeks to replicate the performance of the Morningstar US Large-Mid Cap Broad Growth Index, consisting of US equities with growth traits from both large and mid-cap categories. It is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. As of May 2, 2024, iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)\u2019s net assets came exceeded $2 billion. The fund features an expense ratio of 0.04% and a portfolio comprising 392 holdings.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 4th in iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)\u2019s portfolio. Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 database found that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was held by 293 smart hedge funds, up from 286 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 41.78 million shares worth $6.34 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cFounded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world\u2019s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2022 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering a significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon\u2019s site. Amazon\u2019s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company\u2019s cloud computing segment and increased confidence the company would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.\u201d\n\n7. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 94.88%\n\nFidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) strives to mirror the price and yield performance of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a weighted index reflecting the market capitalization of stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. It is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs, ranking 7th on our list. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) was launched on September 9, 2003. As of March 31, 2024, the fund holds $6.08 billion in portfolio assets, while featuring a portfolio comprising 1,006 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.21%.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the top holdings of Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ). Hedge fund ownership in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) increased to 242 funds at the end of December 2023, compared to 234 in the previous quarter. Chase Coleman\u2019s Tiger Global Management is one of the key stakeholders of the company, with 7.46 million shares worth $2.6 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year\u2019s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.\u201d\n\n6. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 100.46%\n\nNuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) ranks 6th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) follows a passive management strategy, investing primarily in large-cap US equity securities displaying growth characteristics and meeting required environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. It aims to replicate the investment outcomes of the TIAA ESG USA Large-Cap Growth Index, excluding fees and expenses. The fund was launched on December 16, 2016. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) features an expense ratio of 0.26% and holds $1.3 billion in net assets as of May 2, 2024.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the largest holdings of Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was part of 166 hedge fund portfolios at the conclusion of December 2023, up from 163 in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is a prominent stakeholder of Alphabet, with a position worth $2.9 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top growth plays on the radar of smart investors.\n\nPalm Valley Capital Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cGovernments have various irons in the fire for curbing (commandeering?) the power of tech titans, with the European Union rolling out the Digital Markets Act, the Federal Trade Commission suing Amazon for illegally using monopoly power, and the DOJ lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s advertising business going to trial in September.\n\nFurthermore, the dominant technology enterprises are not immune from shooting themselves in the foot. Google\u2019s botched launch of its AI model, Gemini, shows the risk of having too much money. You lose discipline. A Pirate Wires expos\u00e9 into the firm\u2019s culture revealed that employees went to extreme lengths to intentionally degrade the quality of the AI engine\u2019s output for ideological reasons.

Sales are soaring as an increasing number of Americans are spending freely on dining out.\n\nAccording to the Commerce Department, sales at U.S. food and drinking places totaled $98.1 billion in March, up 0.4% month over month after increasing 0.5% in February. Sales at U.S. restaurants rose a solid 6.6% year over year in March, while sales from January through March totaled $27.1 billion.\n\nThe retail sector has struggled for months owing to the price inflationary pressures and is still striving to get back on its feet.\n\nAccording to the Commerce Department, retail sales rose 0.7% in March. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at the current range of 5.25-5.5% after hiking interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022.\n\nMoreover, it hasn\u2019t yet indicated the time for the first rate cut, which is making consumers worry. However, Americans are not hesitant about spending on food despite higher borrowing rates and prices.\n\nThe upward trend in restaurant sales is being driven by robust consumer spending and an increase in personal income. In March, consumer spending increased 0.8%, while personal income rose 0.5% month over month.\n\nAccording to the National Restaurant Association's annual State of the Industry Report, restaurant sales are anticipated to reach a record $1.1 trillion in 2024.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Restaurant Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Are you keeping an eye on undervalued restaurant stocks? In 2022, the full-service restaurant business was projected to have a global market size of $1.5 trillion. By 2030, it was predicted that this amount will increase to as much as $1.8 trillion, data from Statista shows. As a result, investors cannot ignore restaurant stocks, especially the ones with upside and strong ratings from analysts.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the first stock we\u2019ll examine is slated for a historic 50-for-1 stock split, which will make its shares more accessible following record-breaking sales. Strategic acquisitions and a diverse portfolio that includes casual dining giants have helped the second business beat Wall Street\u2019s predictions. Finally, an entertainment-focused eating chain is shaking up the industry by combining gaming and dining and expanding domestically and internationally.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor stockholders of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), the upcoming stock split on June 25 is very exciting. After the split, shares will restart trading again on June 26.\n\nThe first 50-for-1 stock split in Chipotle\u2019s 30-year history is meant to make shares more appealing to a wider range of people. Sales and growth broke records, pushing the price to an all-time high, necessitating the split.\n\nOn the financial front, a solid first quarter of 2024 saw comparable sales rise 7%, and transaction growth exceed 5%. Fourth-quarter sales are up 15% to $2.5 billion compared to 2022. The 8% rise in comparable restaurant sales was due to 7% greater transactions, 1% higher average checks, and to a lesser degree, new restaurant openings. Digital sales made up 36% of food and beverage revenues.\n\nIn terms of the global market, Chipotle is partnering with Alshaya Group to launch its first shop in Kuwait. This is the company\u2019s first step into the Middle East, which expands its worldwide reach in a market valued at approximately $34 billion, with projections showing growth to $56 billion by 2027.\n\nWith so much going for it, it\u2019s no surprise CMG\u2019s upside is at around 2%, but I will want investors to concentrate on the highest price target of $3,600, instead, considering the growth of its digital business, implying an upside of 14%, nicely complimenting its \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d rating.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) an Olive Garden sign on the front of the restaurant\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe first three quarters of fiscal year 2024 were strong for Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), beating Wall Street projections, but the stock is down 8% this year, giving it a premium position among undervalued restaurant stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompany profits rose considerably in the second quarter. Adjusted net profits per share rose 21% to $1.84 from the previous year. Adding Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House and improving operations helped.\n\nThe firm earned $350.9 million before income tax in the third quarter, with adjusted net profits per share rising from $2.34 to $2.62. The reported revenue from operating enterprises increased 11% from year to year.\u200b\n\nThe market\u2019s overall picture supports Darden\u2019s optimism. The corporation expects inflation to fall, lowering prices and increasing profits.\n\nDue to its multiple brands, like Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, and Ruth\u2019s Chris Steakhouse, Darden can adjust to changing client preferences despite inflation. Despite lower-income consumers lowering restaurant spending across all brands, LongHorn Steakhouse reported a 2.3% same-store sales growth, per the latest quarterly numbers.\n\nDarden also announced a new $1 billion share-buying program and a $1.31 quarterly dividend payout, translating into a 3.35% yield, which compares very favorably to the sector average of around 1%.\n\nDave & Busters Entertainment (PLAY) The storefront of a Dave and Busters location at a mall is seen during daytime.\n\nSource: Rosemarie Mosteller / Shutterstock.com\n\nDallas-based Dave & Busters Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) launched an app recently that lets consumers bet on Mario Kart and Skee Ball, making headlines.\n\nPLAY certainly needed the boost as pro forma total comparable store sales fell 7% in Q4 compared to 2022 due to declining demand for its entertainment and eating experience amid inflationary tendencies.\n\nHowever, after the quarter, the market mood is bullish. Dave & Buster\u2019s Q4 EBITDA was $151.8 million. That was around 10% higher than last year and surpassed experts\u2019 projections.\n\nIn addition, the firm has grown globally and inked new partnerships to strengthen its Asia-Pacific presence.\u200b\n\nIn the fiscal year, the firm established 16 new stores, including six in Q4. It also expanded locally and internationally, like entering the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the business repurchased 8.5 million shares for $300 million. The board\u2019s given the green signal for $100 million more share repurchases, bringing its total share buyback authorization to $200 million.\n\nAfter the report dropped, Truist Securities upped Dave & Buster\u2019s price target to $78 per share from $75, anticipating its innovative sales strategies to offset macroeconomic concerns.\n\nTruist Securities is not the only analyst bullish on this quality pick; seven Wall Street analysts rank PLAY a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d. From $52.82, these analysts expect a 12-month average target price of $76, 44% potential upside, giving it a premium position among undervalued restaurant stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "The U.S. restaurant industry is putting up a great show amid price pressures. Sales are soaring as an increasing number of Americans are spending freely on dining out.\n\nAccording to the Commerce Department, sales at U.S. food and drinking places totaled $98.1 billion in March, up 0.4% month over month after increasing 0.5% in February. Sales at U.S. restaurants rose a solid 6.6% year over year in March, while sales from January through March totaled $27.1 billion.\n\nThe retail sector has struggled for months owing to the price inflationary pressures and is still striving to get back on its feet.\n\nAccording to the Commerce Department, retail sales rose 0.7% in March.

However, Americans are not hesitant about spending on food despite higher borrowing rates and prices.\n\nThe upward trend in restaurant sales is being driven by robust consumer spending and an increase in personal income. In March, consumer spending increased 0.8%, while personal income rose 0.5% month over month.\n\nAccording to the National Restaurant Association's annual State of the Industry Report, restaurant sales are anticipated to reach a record $1.1 trillion in 2024.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Stock-Split Stocks Instead",
        "content": "At the moment, there's seemingly no hotter trend than artificial intelligence (AI). Utilizing software and systems in place of humans, and allowing these systems to evolve over time without human intervention in order to become more proficient at their tasks, gives AI a broad use-case that covers almost every sector and industry.\n\nBut what's arguably been an even more-trusted group of stocks for Wall Street and investors is companies enacting stock splits.\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. I say \"cosmetically,\" because stock splits don't alter a company's market cap or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMost investors tend to focus on forward-stock splits, which are designed to reduce the nominal share price of a publicly traded company to make it more affordable for those without access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Since the midpoint of 2021, nearly a dozen high-profile businesses have conducted a forward-stock split, including AI kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nHowever, Wall Street's brightest minds aren't necessarily enamored with the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the artificial intelligence revolution. During the December-ended quarter, billionaires were active sellers of Nvidia stock and piled into two recent stock-split stocks instead.\n\nBillionaire investors sent artificial intelligence stock Nvidia to the chopping block\n\nShares of Nvidia have catapulted higher by nearly 470% since the start of 2023. The clear-cut catalyst behind its outperformance is its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which are what power AI-accelerated data centers. In particular, Nvidia's H100 GPU is responsible for training large language models and powering generative AI solutions.\n\nWith its chips in high demand, Nvidia has enjoyed jaw-dropping GPU pricing power. Data Center segment sales jumped by 217% in fiscal 2024 (ended January 28), while cost of revenue across all of its segments rose by a far more modest 43%.\n\nDespite these advantages, eight billionaire investors reduced their respective fund's stakes in Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe scarcity of Nvidia's GPUs is the primary reason its Data Center sales more than tripled last year. With the company increasing its production of H100 GPUs, and new companies entering the playing field, GPU scarcity is going to be less of a talking point by the latter-half of this year. Billionaires sending Nvidia to the chopping block may be rightly anticipating a drop-off in the company's pricing power and gross margin.\n\nIn addition to an increase in external competition, Nvidia could face immense challenges from internal competitors. Four \"Magnificent Seven\" components account for roughly 40% of Nvidia's net sales. Unfortunately, all four of these industry leaders are developing in-house GPUs of their own. There's a real possibility Nvidia's orders from its top customers taper off significantly in the coming years.\n\nHistory might be the other big catalyst that created a billionaire exodus from Nvidia in the December-ended quarter. There hasn't been a next-big-thing investment or innovation in three decades that didn't endure an early stage bubble. Investors commonly overestimate the adoption and uptake of new technology, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to break that trend.\n\nBut while these eight billionaires were busy dumping shares of Nvidia, quite a few were piling into two outperforming stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWalmart\n\nThe first stock-split that was a favorite among billionaire investors during the fourth quarter is retail juggernaut Walmart(NYSE: WMT). Walmart effected a 3-for-1 forward split in late February.\n\nAll told, five of the prominent billionaires who sold Nvidia stock were buyers of Walmart shares, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,416,174 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (540,004 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (261,294 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (150,570 shares)\n\nFrom an investment standpoint, the lure of putting your money to work in Walmart has long been its size. It's a company with deep pockets that's able to purchase products in bulk. A lower per-unit price for most of its goods allows Walmart to undercut traditional grocers and local mom-and-pop shops on price.\n\nTo add to the above, the vastness of the products Walmart carries in its stores is rivaled by only a few competitors. Walmart has evolved into a one-stop shopping experience for consumers looking for a good deal. With the prevailing rate of inflation creeping back up, Walmart is just the type of business we'd expect to benefit.\n\nAnother reason investors tend to put their trust in Walmart stock over the long run is because it's a consumer staples company. It carries basic need goods and services that are going to draw consumers into its stores regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing. This leads to predictable operating cash flow year after year -- and Wall Street loves predictability.\n\nAlthough Walmart stock isn't cheap, its competitive advantages can yield solid gains for investors over the long run.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe other stock-split stock that billionaires were buying as Nvidia shares were being jettisoned is fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Chipotle announced plans to enact a 50-for-1 forward split in June, assuming it gains approval from its shareholders.\n\nDuring the December-ended quarter, three notable billionaire investors were buyers of Chipotle stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (32,250 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (15,900 shares)\n\nLike Walmart, Chipotle offers investors a couple of well-defined competitive edges that have led to its long-term outperformance.\n\nFor starters, the company's food has been a differentiator. When possible, the company sources its vegetables locally, and it uses responsibly raised meats that are free of routine-use antibiotics. Chipotle's management team learned a long time ago that consumers will willingly pay more for higher-quality food that doesn't wind up in a freezer.\n\n\"Chipotlanes\" are another big source of growth for the company. A \"Chipotlane' is a dedicated drive-thru lane for mobile orders. Outfitting most of its new stores with these digital drive-thru lanes is helping to expedite orders and sustain a superior growth rate among fast-casual restaurant chains.\n\nPerhaps Chipotle's biggest advantage is the most subtle of them all: its menu. The company has purposely kept its menu relatively small to ensure that its staff can quickly prepare meals and shorten wait times. A limited menu also makes it easier for Chipotle to create meaningful buzz when introducing new items.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Walmart wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In the last year, many Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn fact, the recent sale by Brian Niccol was the biggest sale of Chipotle Mexican Grill shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$3,155. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.\n\nAll up, insiders sold more shares in Chipotle Mexican Grill than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nI will like Chipotle Mexican Grill better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this freelist of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nInsiders At Chipotle Mexican Grill Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Chipotle Mexican Grill. Specifically, insiders ditched US$37m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nDoes Chipotle Mexican Grill Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Chipotle Mexican Grill insiders own 0.7% of the company, currently worth about US$569m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Chipotle Mexican Grill Insiders?\n\nInsiders sold Chipotle Mexican Grill shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But since Chipotle Mexican Grill is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Chipotle Mexican Grill.

        "title": "Another Day, Another Failed 2nd Restaurant Chain for Chipotle",
        "content": "On April 24, Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) announced financial results for the first quarter of 2024, and investors absolutely loved it. And to be sure, it was a great quarter. But the quarterly financial report overshadowed an update regarding a new restaurant chain the company was cooking up: Chipotle is abandoning the Farmesa concept that it launched last year.\n\nFarmesa isn't the first failed restaurant concept from Chipotle. It follows a growing list of previous attempts. Here's why it (kind of) matters for investors.\n\nAnother failed attempt for Chipotle\n\nIn February 2023, Chipotle announced a new restaurant chain called Farmesa, offering customizable bowls, not unlike Sweetgreen. However, Restaurant Business reports that Farmesa is now closed. And to investors, CEO Brian Niccol recently said, \"It's not part of our growth strategy right now.\"\n\nIt's not like Chipotle is hurting without Farmesa. The company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) in the first quarter were at all-time highs. This has sent its stock to an all-time high as well.\n\nHowever, it's more than just the headline numbers. Chipotle's restaurant financials are world-class, showing that it's a top operator. In theory, management could apply this premier skill set to multiple restaurant concepts and greatly grow its market opportunity, presenting much higher upside potential to investors.\n\nAs co-founder Steve Ells said in 2011: \"I have always believed that the Chipotle model would work well with a variety of different cuisines. Chipotle's success is not necessarily about burritos and tacos, but rather about serving great, sustainably raised food that is delicious, affordable, and convenient.\"\n\nBut for some reason, the plans to expand by applying the \"Chipotle model\" to other kinds of food just isn't working. Here's a list of what hasn't worked so far:\n\nShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen specialized in Thai and Vietnamese food. It closed all 15 locations in 2017. Tasty Made was an attempt at the traditional fast-food menu, selling hamburgers, fries, and milkshakes. Its only location closed in 2018. Pizzeria Locale excited investors because fast-casual pizza was seen as a no-brainer idea. Chipotle closed the last five locations in 2023. Farmesa opened in 2023 and closed in 2024.\n\nIn the first quarter, Chipotle had 3,479 locations, which on average generated more than $3 million each in sales annually at a restaurant-level operating margin of nearly 28%. Restaurant operators who can achieve these kind of financials should open as many restaurants as possible. A second concept could have helped the company in this regard.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle doesn't even need a second chain to be as big as its core chain. Replicating these numbers with only a few hundred locations would be a big deal. But once again, the company is down to just one restaurant brand.\n\nThe good news\n\nSupposing Chipotle could develop, own, and operate more than one restaurant chain, its long-term market opportunity would be much bigger for investors. That said, the ongoing opportunity with its core brand is still large, and it's larger than what it was projecting just a few years ago.\n\nFor example, billionaire Bill Ackman took a large stake in Chipotle nearly a decade ago, saying that the restaurant chain could reach 5,000 locations someday. Many investors thought this projection was irrationally high. But Niccol is aiming even higher than this now.\n\nIn recent talks, he has stated his goal of growing Chipotle to 7,000 locations. Moreover, management wants the chain's financials to continue improving as well. It believes its locations can reach average annual sales volume of $4 million, which might support even higher profit margins.\n\nAs Niccol said, \"We've got so much opportunity in front of us just with what we can do with the brand Chipotle that internally, we're not working on [a second concept].\"\n\nIn conclusion, it would be really good for shareholders if it could develop multiple restaurant concepts. But at least it still can deliver growth for its investors by further building out the Chipotle concept.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "A stock market crash isn\u2019t always a bad thing. While people nearing retirement should approach the risk of a\u00a0crash\u00a0with more caution, it\u00a0allows younger investors\u00a0to buy fundamentally solid companies at more reasonable valuations. We\u2019ll look at some of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nInvestors who capitalize on market uncertainty and load up on top-tier companies can be in a good position after a few years. However, it\u2019s\u00a0important\u00a0to know which corporations to consider before a correction or a crash happens. That way, you aren\u2019t rushing to make decisions and can craft a plan leading up to market turbulence. These are some of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a clear leader in the online advertising and cloud computing industries.\u00a0The corporation\u2019s Q1 2024 results further reflected\u00a0the company\u2019s\u00a0vast market share in those industries. Revenue increased by 15%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0while net income jumped by 57%\u00a0year-over-year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe high net income growth comes as the company implements more cost-cutting measures while accelerating its top-line growth.\u00a0Continued\u00a0growth in the cloud and artificial intelligence initiatives can lead to more growth\u00a0moving forward.\u00a0Google Cloud in particular has seen rising profits. The segment generated $191 million in Q1 2023. Operating income jumped to $900 million in Q1 2024.\n\nRevenue also grew at a\u00a0higher\u00a0pace for Google Cloud. Net sales came in at $9.57 billion compared to $7.45 billion in the same period last year. That\u2019s a 28.4% year-over-year increase which outpaces Alphabet\u2019s overall revenue growth. The stock has a reasonable 26 P/E ratio which should continue to shrink as the company expands its profit margins.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet isn\u2019t the only advertising giant up for grabs.\u00a0Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has also\u00a0been fulfilling\u00a0its end of the bargain for investors. The stock has gained 25% year-to-date and is up by an impressive 78% over the past year.\u00a0It\u2019s also another one of the top stocks to buy for a market crash today.\n\nThe stock recently plunged after\u00a0Q1 2024 earnings and is in correction territory. However, the earnings report was solid despite the market\u2019s reaction. Revenue increased by 27% year-over-year while net income surged by 117% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s 7% year-over-year daily active user growth across all platforms was also solid. Meta Platforms now has 3.24 billion daily active users. The firm repurchased $14.64 billion worth of shares while distributing $1.27 billion to investors as dividends. Meta Platforms has achieved this level of success while trimming its headcount by 10% year-over-year.\n\nMeta Platforms is making strides in artificial intelligence, but advertising is undoubtedly the\u00a0main\u00a0revenue driver.\u00a0Advertising accounted for $35.6 billion of the company\u2019s $36.5 billion in total revenue. Only\u00a02.2% of the company\u2019s revenue did not come from advertising.\u00a0If Meta Platforms finds another robust income stream like Alphabet did with Google Cloud, the stock can continue to soar.\n\nMarriott International (MAR) Hotel room\n\nSource: Dragon Images / Shutterstock\n\nMarriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) has built one of the top hotel chains in the industry. The firm has nearly 8,800 properties in 139 countries and territories. Marriott International and its investors have benefitted from the travel boom. Shares are up by 69% over the past five years and trades at a 23.5 P/E ratio.\n\nThe momentum continued in\u00a0Q4 2023 as the company reported $23.7 billion in revenue. It was\u00a0a 14% year-over-year increase. Net income grew by 31% year-over-year to reach $3.1 billion. The firm expanded its profit margins and\u00a0has\u00a0raised its quarterly dividend payout above pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0Investors received $0.52 per share in 2023, and the company\u00a0is expected\u00a0to announce a dividend hike in May.\n\nThe hotel chain can also benefit as\u00a0Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) gets more expensive. Airbnb is still a competitor in the hotel industry, but its main appeal in the early stages was more affordable pricing.\u00a0Now,\u00a0there isn\u2019t much of a gap between Airbnb and hotel prices, and hotels offer more amenities.\u00a0Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has stated his desire to make Airbnb feel affordable again. As Airbnb gets more expensive, consumers may flock\u00a0over\u00a0to hotels more often.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has been attracting younger cardholders while raising its profit margins.

These cards have become a core foundation of economic activity, and American Express has\u00a0been benefitting\u00a0from this multi-decade trend.\n\nThe fintech firm reported solid financials in the\u00a0first quarter of 2024.\u00a0Revenue increased by 11%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0while net income jumped by 34%\u00a0year-over-year.\u00a0American Express has been expanding its profit margins and wrapped up Q1 2024 with a 16.9% net profit margin.

Non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 20% year-over-year. Intuit anticipates full-year revenue growth to range from 11% to 12%.

That\u2019s\u00a0a 20% year-over-year increase, and\u00a0Badger Meter is due for an announced dividend hike in August.\n\nThe company posted solid\u00a0Q1 2024 financials that were\u00a0highlighted by a 23% year-over-year increase in total sales. While total sales came in at $196.3 million diluted EPS soared by 50% year-over-year to reach $0.99 per share.\u00a0Badger Meter generated record quarterly revenue, operating profit, and EPS results.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been\u00a0trouncing\u00a0the stock market in recent years.

The\u00a0fast food\u00a0restaurant chain delivers healthier food options which has made consumers willing to pay higher prices.\n\nThe company\u00a0has raised menu prices four times in the past two years. Chipotle attributed the price hikes to the state of the economy, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the fast food giant from reporting\u00a0strong\u00a0financials.\n\nRevenue jumped by 14.1% year-over-year in\u00a0Q1 2024. Net income grew\u00a0at a faster clip\u00a0and was up by 23.2% year-over-year. That growth rate helped the company reach $359.3 million in net earnings for the quarter. Chipotle still plans to open 285-315 restaurants in 2024. More than 80% of these restaurants will have a Chipotlane. These additions have been a boon for the company, as digital sales represented 36.5% of total food and beverage revenue.\n\nOn this\u00a0date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in GOOG.

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) has always been an outlier of a restaurant stock, a factor that was behind a recent price target increase from an analyst. According to him, the fast-casual chain operator, which is heading for the first stock split in its history and trades over $3,000 now, is deserving of a price tag approaching $4,000. Here's a brief look at this recent evaluation.\n\nA stock-split superstar\n\nThat boost clocked in at over 12%, as Evercore ISI's David Palmer upped his Chipotle target from $3,200 per share to $3,600. At the risk of stating the obvious, this is a pre-stock split price; that piece of financial engineering is subject to shareholder approval in a vote to be taken at the company's June annual meeting.\n\nLike many recent changes in analyst evaluations, Palmer's modification came just after Chipotle unveiled quarterly results.\n\nAs it usually does, the company posted excellent numbers, with first-quarter revenue rising 14% year-over-year to $2.7 billion, comparable-restaurant sales advancing by 7%, and per-share profitability vaulting an impressive 27% higher to $13.37. Chipotle beat the consensus analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nAfter parsing that earnings report, Palmer raised his estimates for \"comps\" and earnings. Referring to the former, he said his increase was because \"Chipotle's superior 'food quality for the money' and improving throughput is helping differentiate itself from an industry with declining traffic.\"\n\nTasty tech temptations\n\nThe analyst also believes Chipotle can leverage technology to beef up its bottom line, for example using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its marketing efforts. Advanced kitchen equipment, meanwhile, should help it slice costs.\n\nChipotle's management, in my view, is one of the best teams in the business. The company is the gold standard in the fast-casual segment, with consistently high profit margins almost unknown in the challenging restaurant industry. It's proven to be adept at leveraging available tech to bolster its results, and with more opportunities to do so those numbers are sure to keep improving. This stock continues to be a winner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Despite signs that Americans are still craving their favorite burrito bowls and willing to pay extra for guacamole, Chipotle is carefully watching consumer behavior amid higher labor and menu costs.\n\n\"The [California] minimum wage, higher minimum wage just took effect earlier this month,\" CFO Jack Hartung said on \"The Big Money Show,\" Tuesday.\n\n\"We did take a modest price increase of 6 to 7%. We've been watching the traffic since we took the price increase. We're not seeing anything yet, we're not seeing any change in behavior yet,\" he continued. \"It's very early, so we'll keep a close eye on it.\"\n\nPrices at Chipotle, McDonald's and other fast-food giants in California are reportedly rising after a minimum wage hike went into effect one month ago.\n\nCHIPOTLE WANTS TO HIRE 19K NEW EMPLOYEES AS IT GEARS UP FOR \u2018BURRITO SEASON\u2019\n\n\"Chipotle said in an investor call Wednesday that prices at its nearly 500 California restaurants climbed 6% to 7% during the first week of April compared with last year, playing out across its menu,\" The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung speaks about the restaurant chain's menu price increases on \"The Big Money Show.\"\n\n\"The state isn't making it easy,\" Chipotle Chief Executive Brian Niccol reportedly said.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital on Monday, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer for Chipotle, Laurie Schalow, clarified: \"Similar to others in the restaurant industry, we implemented a statewide price increase in light of new legislation in California increasing the wages of restaurant workers.\"\n\nHartung added that Chipotle regulars are still entering the restaurant chain\u2019s doors and that the company expects an elastic consumer that\u2019s sustainable for their quick service model.\n\n\"We had a great first quarter. We had a 7% comp and more than 5% of that was driven by transaction growth, which I know is tough to come by in this kind of environment. The thing we're most proud of, when you look at our customers by income brackets, our low income consumers came at the same rate as our high income consumers,\" the CFO pointed out.\n\n\"And that tells us that we are really providing great value, and we're charging a fair price for it.\"\n\nEchoing a similar message as celebrity chef Robert Irvine, Hartung explained how Chipotle is turning to technology and investing in robots that can reallocate simple work tasks \u2013 without eliminating human workers \u2013 during a costly time for business.\n\nChipotle\u2019s line chef robot will focus on online orders only, according to the CFO, and is said to minimize ingredient mistakes while ensuring on-time delivery.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"You won't see robots at the front line. So if you want to come in and sweet talk and try to get a little extra rice, a little extra ingredients along the way, you'll still have that opportunity,\" Hartung said.\n\n\"It could be very, very busy during our peak lunch and our peak dinner,\" he admitted. \"We're not going to replace employees, but we're going to make the jobs of our employees much easier.\"\n\nREAD MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS\n\nFOX Business\u2019 Jeffrey Clark contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Chipotle keeping \u2018a close eye\u2019 on customer behavior after raising menu prices, wages\n\nView comments",

But it subsequently lost over $210 billion in April.\n\nThen there's Meta Platforms, which turned in a similar performance to Microsoft, gaining nearly $330 billion through March before losing just over $140 billionin April.\n\nApril had its share of winners, too, with these names also marking a reversal from what predominated in the year's first quarter.\n\nTesla (TSLA) gained over $25 billion in April, putting it in second place for the month after coming in next-to-last in the first quarter with a loss of $230 billion.\n\nApple (AAPL) was sitting dead last among US stocks at the end of March with a year-to-date market cap loss of nearly $350 billion. After the close on Monday, it had gained over $30 billion in value over April, but a day later \u2014 at month-end \u2014 that gain had dwindled to $2 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) took first prize, gaining nearly $150 billion in the month. All of this and more came the day after it reported first quarter earnings last week, logging a 10% gain, which was good for $197 billion of market cap.\n\nThese big names also demonstrate how moves across sectors showed similar trends of reversion, with gains and losses swapping places.\n\nInformation Technology (XLK) \u2014 the home of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 was the No. 1 large-cap gainer in market cap through March, rising $1.5 trillion. It was also the biggest loser in April, falling over $650 billion.\n\nCommunications Services (XLC) \u2014 home of Alphabet and Meta \u2014 was third in first quarter gains, adding $570 billion in market cap. It fell to the middle of the pack when it comes to April losses, losing nearly $100 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumer Discretionary (XLY) \u2014 home of Amazon and Tesla \u2014 was dead last among sectors in the first three months of the year, only to drop $180 billion in April.\n\nNotable April losses also include Financials (XLF), down $275 billion, and Health Care (XLV), which lost over $280 billion.\n\nThe only sector to gain in April was Utilities (XLU), which has also been the biggest laggard of this bull market that began in October of 2022.\n\nApril's plot twists still appear to be corrections, rather than shifts, in the narrative. Meta, for instance, may have lost well over $140 billion in value over the month of April, but shareholders are still sitting on annual gains of over 20%.\n\nTuesday's rocky close comes right as the proverbial \"sell in May and go away\" headlines are set to trigger.

        "content": "Shake Shack Earnings: What To Look For From SHAK\n\nFast-food chain Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow before market hours. Here's what investors should know.\n\nShake Shack beat analysts' revenue expectations by 2.2% last quarter, reporting revenues of $286.2 million, up 20% year on year. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nIs Shake Shack a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Shake Shack's revenue to grow 14.9% year on year to $290.9 million, slowing from the 24.5% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.10 per share. Shake Shack Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Shake Shack has missed Wall Street's revenue estimates three times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Shake Shack's peers in the restaurants segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Chipotle delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 14.1%, beating analysts' expectations by 1.2%, and Restaurant Brands reported revenues up 9.4%, topping estimates by 2.2%. Chipotle traded up 6.5% following the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Chipotle's results here and Restaurant Brands's results here.\n\nInflation fears have put pressure on growth stocks, and while some of the restaurants stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share prices down 3.6% on average over the last month. Shake Shack is up 5.2% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $105.9 (compared to the current share price of $108.82).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this Mexican food chain have returned +11.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, which Chipotle falls in, has lost 0.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nChipotle is expected to post earnings of $15.52 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $55.08 points to a change of +22.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.7%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $66.29 indicates a change of +20.3% from what Chipotle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Chipotle is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Chipotle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.34 billion and $12.81 billion estimates indicate +14.8% and +13% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nChipotle reported revenues of $2.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.1%. EPS of $13.37 for the same period compares with $10.50 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.01%. The EPS surprise was +14.96%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nChipotle is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Chipotle. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the 15 best cuisines in the world. If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of food cuisines, you can directly go to the 5 Best Cuisines in the World.\n\nThe Global Food Industry\n\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global food service market was valued at $2.39 trillion in 2022. The industry is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.79% from 2023 to 2030, reaching $5.42 trillion at the end of the forecast period. The food service industry refers to all businesses that prepare and serve food, either for takeaway or on-premise consumption. Examples of these include restaurants, canteens, university cafeterias, and catering services. In 2022, the Asia-Pacific market held the largest share in the industry, amounting to $944.71 billion.\n\nAnother report by Fortune Business Insights valued the US food service market at $824.6 billion in 2022. From the forecast period of 2023 to 2030, the market is expected to grow to $1.7 trillion at a CAGR of 10.03%. The ethnic food market, which includes international cuisines such as Asian, Mexican, and Italian, has also been growing in size. In 2023, a report by Fortune Business Insights valued the ethnic foods industry at $81.59 billion. From the forecast period of 2024 to 2032, the market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.34%, reaching $153.21 billion by the end. Within the ethnic foods market as well, Asia-Pacific held the largest segment, amounting to $38.22 billion.\n\nCuisine Preferences - Analysis of Social Media Trends\n\nSocial media trends can give us essential insights into consumer preferences. To gauge the popularity of various cuisines around the globe, we conducted a hashtag analysis through Instagram. As of April 29, 2024, the term \u2018Italian food\u2019 had been mentioned in Instagram hashtags 23 million times, making it the most tagged cuisine on the platform. The second spot was held by Japanese cuisine with 22.4 million tags, followed by Indian food (18.5 million tags), Korean food (10.5 million tags), and Mexican food (9.9 million tags). Thus, Instagram tags showed that most people on the platform were talking about Italian food. Chinese and Thai cuisines were also trendy, with around nine million hashtags for each.\n\nWe also evaluated the popularity of certain cuisines by conducting a keyword analysis through Semrush, which showcased different results. We checked global volumes, which Semrush defines as the total number of searches for an analyzed keyword in all databases. The search volume data on Semrush is updated every month. As of April 29, 2024, the term \u2018Chinese food\u2019 had a global search volume of 1.4 million, of which 450,000 searches were from the US. Furthermore, the term \u2018Chinese food near me\u2019 was the top related search, with a global volume of 3.4 million. Based on these statistics, Chinese food is the most searched cuisine in recent days. The second spot was held by Thai food (549,000 global searches), followed by Indian food (496,400 global searches), Mexican food (480,900 global searches), and Korean food (410,000 global searches).\n\nStory continues\n\nMexican Popularity in the US\n\nOur analysis of Instagram hashtags and global searches showed that Mexican food was in the top five spots on both platforms. According to a report published by the Pew Research Center on January 11, 2024, 11% of the restaurants in the US serve Mexican food. This means that every one in ten restaurants around the country focuses on Mexican cuisine. The report further stated that 85% of US counties have at least one Mexican restaurant, and those without them tend to have small populations. The 15% of counties that do not have Mexican restaurants only have a population of four million individuals.\n\nCalifornia and Texas are the states with the highest number of Mexican restaurants, collectively accounting for 40% of the total. California is also home to several cities with the largest fast food consumption in the US, making it an excellent state for food enthusiasts. The report also evaluated the states where Mexican restaurants made up the highest share of total restaurants. These were Southwestern states bordering Mexico, showcasing that geography can affect how cuisines spread through a country. In New Mexico, Mexican restaurants make up 22% of all restaurants. In Texas, they make up 20%. In Arizona, 18% of all restaurants are Mexican.\n\nThe report also noted certain common features among these restaurants. Out of the total Mexican restaurants, 22% are categorized as fast food restaurants, 12% specialize in tacos, 8% are food trucks or carts, and 6% offer Tex-Mex food, which is a blend of Mexican and Southern American culinary features. PRC also noted that most Mexican restaurants were towards the inexpensive price scale. When evaluating restaurants whose pricing was publicly available, 61% only had one dollar sign on Yelp, emphasizing their moderately priced food. Less than 1% of restaurants had three dollar signs or more.\n\nLastly, the study noted that while Mexican food was considerably popular around the country, other Hispanic cuisines did not share the same level of fame. Even though 85% of counties had at least one Mexican restaurant, only 29% had at least one Hispanic or Latino restaurant which was not mainly Mexican. Previously, in a 2023 study, PRC discovered that 12% of all US restaurants served Asian food. Of these, 71% serve either Chinese, Japanese, or Thai. In total, 73% of US counties have at least one Asian restaurant of any cuisine. Certain Japanese restaurants also made their way into our list of the most expensive restaurants in the world.\n\nBiggest Mexican Names in the US Food Scene\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

(NYSE:YUM) had a plan to turn Taco Bell and Pizza Hut into \u2018AI-first\u2019 restaurants. One of the examples of the company\u2019s increased focus on AI is the SuperApp for its employees.

The app is currently in use in around 8,700 locations of Pizza Hut and KFC, both of which chains are owned by Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM).\n\nWhile Mexican cuisine has been popular in the US for several years, other cuisines have also been making their way into the public\u2019s good books.

        "content": "When California\u2019s groundbreaking law raising fast-food workers\u2019 minimum wage from $15.50 per hour to $20 took effect at the start of the month, food chains including Chipotle, Chick-Fil-A, Pizza Hut and Jack in the Box warned customers to expect higher costs for that go-to burrito or slice.\n\nThose warnings are now materializing: prices for a burger, burrito, or fries at several big fast-food chains have jumped since the new minimum wage was signed into law in September, taking effect on April 1, according to a report by market research firm Datassential. Since September, the state\u2019s prices have risen 7%, leading the nation.\n\nThis year, 22 states have raised their minimum wage, affecting nearly 10 million workers. The benefits of a higher minimum wage include helping low-income workers earn enough to live on as inflation drives the cost of living higher all over the country and closing gender, racial and ethnic wage gaps, because people of color are overrepresented among those earning the minimum or less. But better pay is also part of a problem, since businesses need to front higher labor costs on top of rising food prices\u2014and are now shifting that cost onto consumers through price hikes.\n\nThose hikes are many. Chipotle told investors last week that prices at nearly 500 of its California chains increased between 6% and 7% across its menu during the first week of April, compared to the same time last year. At California Chick-fil-A locations, prices have increased by over 10% on average since the start of April, according to research by Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. One Pizza Hut franchisee cited the wage hike as the reason for a preemptive wave of layoffs, in which more than 1,000 delivery drivers will be cut this year across the state.\n\nAccording to Gordon Haskett\u2019s data, prices at many popular chains in California rose from mid-February to mid-April. Prices at Starbucks, Shake Shack, Chipotle and Taco Bell all jumped by roughly 5% in those two months, while restaurant prices nationwide rose just 0.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nChipotle, Chick-fil-A, Taco Bell and Shake Shack did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nCalifornia employs more fast food workers than any other state in the country, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report, followed by Texas, Florida and New York. California now offers fast food workers the highest guaranteed base salary in the industry; for all other workers, it also offers one of the highest minimum wages in the country, at $16 per hour.\n\nTo be sure, for many minimum wage workers, the pay raises are needed. Of the nearly 10 million workers in the country who are now set to receive raises, women make up over half; nearly a quarter of them, or roughly 2.5 million, are working parents with families; and over 50% of workers getting raises currently earn incomes below the poverty line, according to a report by the Economic Policy Institute.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a higher minimum wage, government spending on low-income worker benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and spending on earned income tax credit and child tax credits could drop by billions, according to EPI.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s recent legislation has also spurred alarm among other food sectors excluded from the new minimum wage standard, notably the state\u2019s school food service industry. Food service workers historically are some of the lowest-paid employees in public schools, but are now in high demand after California became the first state to offer free meals for all 6.2 million public school students in the state\u2014and the higher wages from fast food jobs are forcing many schools to up their pay.\n\nLast year, Sacramento Unified School District increased wages for its food service workers by 10%, hiking another 6% in July to bring workers to $20 per hour. According to an AP report, it was the district\u2019s largest single raise in nearly three decades. A Southern California school district doubled its food service staff to 40 people after more students were eating school meals, the outlet reported, but other districts, like one in Los Angeles county, found they couldn\u2019t afford to pay their food service workers a comparable wage. A district official told the AP food-service workers could earn up to $25.51 per hour, but would only work three hours per day and be ineligible for health benefits.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\n\nAnother factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CMG for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Chipotle Mexican Grill's main business drivers.\n\nA Delaware corporation, Chipotle Mexican Grill, together with its subsidiaries, operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains. The company was founded in 1993 by Steve Ells, who started with a single restaurant in Denver, CO. The company offers a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. Chipotle restaurants feature free-range, hormone-free pork, natural chicken and other meat products cooked using traditional methods and served in a unique atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe company is committed to using high-quality real ingredients, classic cooking techniques and distinctive interior design to serve customers. As of Dec 31, 2023, the company owned and operated more than 3,400 restaurants across the United States, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth is significantly driven by its digital platform. It has enhanced its capabilities by digitizing restaurant kitchens, expanding partnerships with third-party delivery services, and increasing the number of Chipotlanes (drive-through format for customer pick-up of digital orders). Digital sales, encompassing revenue generated through the Chipotle website, Chipotle app, or third-party delivery aggregators, which also includes revenue deferrals linked to Chipotle Rewards, constituted 37.4% of food and beverage revenue in 2023, compared to 39.4% in 2022 and 45.0% in 2021. The company has facilitated convenient digital ordering through enhancements to the Chipotle app and website, including unlimited customization, contactless delivery, and group ordering.\r\n\r\nThe company utilizes multiple marketing channels, including national television, digital marketing, social media, fundraising, events and sponsorships to reach consumers. Third-party service providers mostly provide delivery services.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Chipotle launched a loyalty program called Chipotle Rewards, which provides customers with the opportunity to earn bonus points or free food. Earned rewards generally expire one to six months after they are issued and points typically expire if an account is inactive for six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Chipotle Mexican Grill, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in April 2014 would be worth $6,344.63, or a gain of 534.46%, as of April 29, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 gained 173.69% and the price of gold went up 73.49% over the same time frame.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for CMG.\n\nShares of Chipotle have outperformed the industry in the past year. The company reported first-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, the company reported benefits stemming from enhanced throughput and effective marketing initiatives like Braised Beef Barbacoa and Chicken Al Pastor, leading to strong sales and transaction growth. Also, consistent strength in digital sales, rise in menu prices and new restaurant openings bode well. Going forward, it continues to focus on the stage gate process and leveraging digital programs to expand access and convenience. However, elevated wage and commodity inflation pose concerns. For 2024, the company expects the cost of sales to be in the low to mid-single-digit range.\n\nThe stock is up 9.64% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 13 higher, for fiscal 2024. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "In the book Algorithms to Live By, I was exposed to a concept that improved my ability to make decisions -- the \"explore-exploit trade-off.\" I'll spare you the nerdy details. But I'm at the stage of life where I should be exploring things. Instead, I keep exploiting (ordering) the same chicken burrito from Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) over and over because it's just so good. Why explore the menu further?\n\nChipotle does a good job making my burrito. But that's not the only thing this restaurant chain does well. The company has profit margins that are hard to comprehend, and it's incredibly material for investors making decisions about Chipotle stock today.\n\nOne of the most remarkable numbers I've ever seen\n\nOn April 24, Chipotle reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Keep in mind that there were nearly 3,500 company-owned locations at the end of the quarter. This is a huge chain, and it consequently has big corporate expenses outside of its restaurants. These are called general and administrative expenses, and they cost Chipotle over $200 million in Q1 alone.\n\nThese expenses are largely necessary, but they aren't core to running a restaurant. If you strip out these corporate costs for analysis purposes, you're left with the restaurant-level financials. And this is where Chipotle really shines.\n\nIn Q1, Chipotle had a restaurant-level operating-profit margin of 27.5%. Since the restaurant industry is notoriously a low-margin proposition, Chipotle's numbers are remarkable.\n\nChipotle's Q1 margin wasn't only good in comparison to other restaurants, it was also good in comparison to itself. Here's how the five most recent quarters have played out.\n\nQuarter Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Restaurant-level operating margin 25.6% 27.5% 26.3% 25.4% 27.5%\n\nNumbers from Chipotle's press releases. Table by author.\n\nRight now Chipotle is hitting its best numbers in the past year, which is encouraging for shareholders. In fact, the company is actually hitting record high numbers that are night-and-day better than just five years ago. And the numbers were nothing to sneeze at back then.\n\nHere's a table of Chipotle's numbers from five years ago, with the most recent quarter back in there again for comparison.\n\nQuarter Q1 2018 Q2 2018 Q3 2018 Q4 2018 Q1 2024 Restaurant-level operation margin 19.5% 19.7% 18.7% 17% 27.5%\n\nNumbers from Chipotle's press releases. Table by author.\n\nLooking at 2018 holistically, Chipotle had a restaurant-level operating margin of 18.7%, which in itself was a marked improvement from 2017. But even though it was already good back then, this profitability metric was 47% better in the most recent quarter, compared to what the company was capable of just five years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nPut another way, for every $1,000 in sales, Chipotle's restaurants made $187 profit in 2018. In comparison, in Q1, restaurants made $275 in profit for the same sales numbers. That might not seem like much of an improvement. But the company has nearly 3,500 locations and they do over $3 million in average annual sales, so it adds up.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nIf Chipotle had only opened a lot of new restaurants over the years, it would have been a growth opportunity. But because it's been able to increase sales per location and consequently boost its restaurant-level profits, it's been an explosive growth opportunity. If you want to understand why Chipotle stock is up about 370% in only five years, look no further than its 400% gains in earnings per share (EPS). CMG data by YCharts.\n\nI admit that I'm personally conflicted about the right takeaway here. On one hand, Chipotle is putting up remarkable profitability numbers and should be commended. On the other hand, I wonder how sustainable its current margins are. And if margins slip to more historical levels, then this stock could be stuck in neutral even if its revenue continues to climb.\n\nIn other words, future restaurant-level profitability will absolutely matter for Chipotle's shareholders because it affects overall profits.\n\nThinking longer-term, Chipotle aims to have 7,000 company-owned locations in the U.S., and it believes these can reach $4 million in annual sales volume. This would undoubtedly lead to good things for shareholders if the company can keep its profit margins up.\n\nIt's a tall task ahead for Chipotle -- when you already have the best margins in the business, it's hard to maintain those and even further improve. However, this company has silenced the doubters time and again during its nearly 20 years as a public company.\n\nTherefore, it's probably better to give it the benefit of the doubt and believe it can continue crushing restaurant-level profitability.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has Almost 20% of His Pershing Square Portfolio Invested in This Magnificent Growth Stock",
        "content": "Due to laws and regulations overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), large asset managers are required to publicly disclose their equity positions within 45 days of a quarter's end. For the retail investor, this is a potential gold mine of possible stock ideas.\n\nOne well-known hedge fund manager, Bill Ackman, who heads Pershing Square Capital Management, is closely watched. His track record has made him somewhat of an investing legend. He runs a concentrated book of what he and his team believe are outstanding companies.\n\nAfter quickly glancing at the $10.4 billion portfolio, you'll see that there's one business that makes up more than 18% of the assets. This magnificent growth stock has soared 316% in just the past five years. Let's try and figure out what Ackman likes about this company before answering whether it makes for a worthy investment today.\n\nSatisfying hungry shareholders\n\nBill Ackman's firm has owned shares in Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) since the second half of 2016. This investment has clearly worked out wonderfully. Since Ackman is a student of the great Warren Buffett, I think I can identify a few key factors that he appreciates the most about this booming Tex-Mex restaurant concept.\n\nFor starters, Chipotle has been able to post healthy revenue growth over the years. This has come from a combination of same-store sales gains, as well as opening new locations across the country. Between 2018 and 2023, Chipotle's revenue jumped 102%\n\nAdding to the company's strong fundamentals is its fantastic profitability. Last year, this business reported an operating margin of 15.8%. That's a level of financial prowess that the vast majority of companies would aspire to achieve, let alone restaurant businesses.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the margin improve over time. Even though all of Chipotle's stores are company-owned, the business has been able to better leverage its operating costs, like labor, occupancy, and administrative functions, over the past few years to rapidly grow the bottom line.\n\nI'm sure Ackman likes how Chipotle puts its customers' needs first and foremost. It's a simple idea, but focusing on real ingredients that are freshly prepared has been the cornerstone of this company's success. What's more, that Chipotle invested so much time and lots of resources into developing its digital foundation, with its mobile app, as well as the build-out of drive-thru locations, increases accessibility and convenience for consumers.\n\nGiving its hungry customers a top-notch value proposition has given Chipotle proven pricing power, another favorable trait about this company. Despite ongoing inflationary pressures that pushed up the costs of proteins, avocados, and paper products, Chipotle has had no issue hiking menu prices, with seemingly minimal impact to its growth trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat does the market think?\n\nBased on the numerous positive attributes Chipotle possesses, coupled with the fact that Bill Ackman is a prominent shareholder with such a sizable chunk of his fund invested in the stock, it could be tempting for individuals to immediately add the business to their portfolios. Before doing so, it's important to figure out what the market thinks about Chipotle today.\n\nAt its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 66, the stock is extremely expensive, in my opinion. When Ackman first bought shares in the third quarter of 2016, Chipotle was in the early innings of winning over consumers following its E. coli health scare. Around that time, the stock had dropped precipitously from the summer of 2015 to the summer of 2016, which probably caught Ackman's attention.\n\nBased on the current valuation, the market fully appreciates this company and then some. Therefore, I don't think Chipotle makes for a smart buying opportunity right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Bill Ackman Has 100% of His $11 Billion Portfolio in Just 8 Stocks",
        "content": "Bill Ackman is something of a legend in investing circles. He manages Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund he founded, which has nearly $11 billion in assets under management. The activist investor made his fortune by acquiring sizable positions in companies and pushing management to make positive changes that increase shareholder value.\n\nWhat sets Ackman apart from his hedge fund colleagues is that Pershing Square owns large stakes in just eight to 12 companies and generally holds them for years. It focuses on high-quality, large-cap, North American companies with limited downside and predictable, recurring cash flows. That strategy has been wildly successful for Ackman, as Pershing Square has generated a 31% annualized return over the past five years, roughly double the performance of the S&P 500.\n\nLet's look at the eight stocks that made up Pershing Square's portfolio to close out 2023 and why Ackman chose them. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Chipotle: 22%\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) is by far Pershing's largest holding, with roughly 825,000 shares worth more than $2.4 billion. Ackman first purchased Chipotle stock back in 2016 after the company experienced a spate of food safety issues which caused the stock to lose half its value.\n\nAckman cited Chipotle's \"continued focus on exceptional food and operational excellence\" for fueling the company's impressive growth. In 2023, revenue grew 14%, resulting in diluted earnings per share (EPS) that climbed 38%. Ackman highlighted Chipotle's same-store sales that jumped 8% and margin expansion of 26% as fueling his confidence that Chipotle has a \"long runway for robust growth.\"\n\nOn a side note, Chipotle recently announced a 50-for-1 stock split, the first in the company's 30-year history.\n\n2. Hilton: 17%\n\nPershing holds a long-standing position in Hilton Worldwide Holdings(NYSE: HLT), totaling 9 million shares worth nearly $1.9 billion. Ackman invested in the hotel operator in late 2018, significantly boosting his stake at the height of the pandemic, betting travel would eventually rebound. That bet has paid off big time.\n\nAckman called Hilton a \"high-quality business... led by an exceptional management team.\" In 2023 Hilton's revenue grew 17%, while adjusted EPS jumped 27%. Ackman cited the company's profit, noting it was 59% above pre-COVID levels, partially driven by average daily revenue per room that is 13% higher than in 2022. Ackman is also impressed by the company's market share increases.\n\n3. Restaurant Brands: 16%\n\nAstute investors will recognize the trend that's beginning to appear -- a continuing bet on the resilience of the consumer. Pershing Square holds more than 23 million shares of Restaurant Brands International(NYSE: QSR), in a stake worth $1.7 billion. The company owns such iconic brands as Burger King, Popeyes, Firehouse Subs, and Tim Hortons. Ackman first invested in the restauranteur in 2012, before the company even went public, then increased his stake during the pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\nAckman is excited by Restaurant Brands' \"long-term growth potential trading at a discounted valuation.\" Global sales climbed 12% in 2023, pushing EPS up 16%. He also likes the company's focus on the pure franchised royalty model, which offers \"decades\" of growth ahead.\n\n4. Alphabet (Class C shares): 14%\n\nOne of the key developments in 2023 was Ackman's investment in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG). Pershing holds 9.4 million Class C shares, with no voting rights, worth a $1.5 billion. Ackman cited \"misplaced concerns over the company's artificial intelligence (AI) positioning,\" resulting in an attractive valuation. That bet is already paying off.\n\nAlphabet's core advertising business improved consistently throughout 2023, as revenue grew 10% while EPS surged 27%. Ackman believes the strength of search and YouTube and the growth of Google Cloud will generate margin expansion, even as Alphabet invests heavily in AI.\n\nAlphabet's Class C shares have (modestly) outperformed Class A shares over the past five years, which may explain why Ackman owns more of the former. That said, he also owns Class A shares. (See No. 7.)\n\n5. Canadian Pacific Kansas City: 11%\n\nIn a page taken directly from Warren Buffett's (and Bill Gates') playbook, Ackman is betting on North American railroads. Pershing returned to one of his favorite investments in 2021 and holds 15 million shares of Canadian Pacific Kansas City(NYSE: CP), worth more than $1.2 billion. Ackman is attracted by the \"oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry.\"\n\nIn 2023, Canadian Pacific's revenue grew 42%, though EPS grew just 12%, hampered by labor disruptions and the weak economy. When Canadian Pacific completed its acquisition of Kansas City Southern last year, it created the only railroad with a direct route from Canada to Mexico. Ackman highlights the resulting revenue and cost synergies and its \"one-of-a-kind network\" and notes that rail is the cheapest, most viable way to transport heavy freight over long distances.\n\n6. Howard Hughes Holdings: 11%\n\nOf special note is Pershing's stake in Howard Hughes Holdings(NYSE: HHH), holding nearly 19 million shares worth $1.2 billion -- a 38% stake in the company. Ackman believes the property and land developer's ownership of master planned communities (MPCs) will \"drive resilient, long-term value creation.\" He points to the ongoing shortage of resale housing inventory which is driving strong demand for new homes.\n\nHoward Hughes Holdings delivered record MPC earnings before taxes and record operating asset net operating income. If that sounds confusing, that's because it's a complicated business designed to generate returns over years or even decades, so it won't be for everyone -- but Ackman is clearly sold.\n\n7. Alphabet (Class A shares): 6%\n\nPershing also holds 4.3 million Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Class A shares -- with voting rights -- worth $693 million. These are a merely a different class of shares for the same company, so the investing thesis here is the same. (See No. 4.)\n\n8. Lowe's: 3%\n\nUntil recently, Pershing Square held about 1.2 million shares of Lowe's(NYSE: LOW) in a stake valued at $286 million -- but no more. By the time the hedge fund's annual report came out in February, it revealed that Ackman had sold the remaining portion of his position. Pershing had maintained its stake in Lowe's since 2018, generating $1.8 billion in profit. The results were driven by the transformation of the business, thanks to robust same-store sales growth over five years and operating margin that expanded by 55%.\n\nAckman revealed that Pershing exited the investment, citing the macroeconomic environment, difficult industry conditions, and increased downside risk.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Where Will Cava Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Restaurant brands come and go, but when a concept is new and attractive it can lead to exciting stories on Wall Street. That's basically what's going on today with Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA), a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant that's drawing in customers in huge numbers. The next three years are likely to see the company grow at a rapid clip.\n\nBut investors need to go in with their eyes wide open, and keenly focused on this key industry metric.\n\nCava is tapping the Chipotle playbook\n\nCava's restaurant concept isn't really new. It basically rips off Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE: CMG) assembly line approach to food preparation, but it does it with Mediterranean food instead of Mexican fare. However, this fact makes the comparison here pretty obvious. To lay some important groundwork, at the end of 2023 Chipotle had 3,371 locations in the United States (and another 66 foreign locations). Cava's store count at the end of 2023 was just 309. CMG Chart\n\nCava's entire store base would be little more than a rounding error for Chipotle. But this hints at the potential growth opportunity ahead for Cava, even if it only manages to grow to half the size of Chipotle. Notably, in 2023 the company pushed hard on the growth front, opening 72 new restaurants. That's probably too fast, so it is appropriate that management is only planning on 48 to 52 new locations in 2024.\n\nStill, at that pace, Cava is set for material growth in 2024. If it can come close to those numbers again in 2025 and 2026, which seems like a reasonable goal, the restaurant will add as many as 150 new locations over the next three years. So the business could grow by as much as 50%. That's huge!\n\nThe fly in the ointment for fast-growing restaurants\n\nEach new location will bring with it new revenue, helping to boost the top line. This is something that Wall Street likes to see with young restaurant concepts. Right now, the company has a particularly compelling story to tell, noting that same-store sales growth came in at nearly 18% in 2023. That's an insanely high number and suggests the company's Mediterranean concept is in high demand. For reference, Chipotle's same-store sales totaled just under 8% in 2023.\n\nThis is where investors need to pay extra close attention. It is unlikely that Cava can sustain such rapid same-store sales growth, which effectively measures the performance of stores that have been open for at least a year. The risk of a rapid expansion plan is that new locations start to cannibalize older ones, leading to weak same-store sales growth even as the new locations boost the overall top line.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt isn't uncommon for Wall Street to push young restaurants so hard for growth that they stop paying as much attention to the core business. They just become new store machines.\n\nSo, as Cava grows its stores and business over the next three years, investors need to focus on same-store sales. This will help you determine if the growth is broad based or if new locations are benefiting at the expense of older ones. If the latter is the case Cava is destined for trouble.\n\nThe Chipotle comparison is probably a good one here, with a reasonable target for Cava's same-store growth being something similar to what its larger peer puts up.\n\nBigger isn't always better\n\nCava is likely to be a bigger company in three years, perhaps materially so. But that doesn't mean it will be a better company. As an investor, you need to watch the top line and the store count. But don't forget to monitor same-store sales, as well. That's going to be a key determinant of whether or not Cava's growth is truly sustainable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "Stock splits don't change the value of a company. They simply divide its profits among more shares. You can think of a split as a pizza that's cut into slices. You still have the same amount of food. It's just easier -- and less expensive -- to buy a single slice.\n\nNevertheless, stock splits tend to create a buzz of excitement. Companies that split their shares are usually performing well, and the ability to buy more shares of these high-flying businesses at more affordable prices is something many investors appreciate.\n\nIf you're on the hunt for stock-split stocks, here are two of the best available to buy in the market today.\n\nStock split stock to buy No. 1: Walmart\n\nPeople love a bargain. That's particularly true in today's challenging economic environment. With stubbornly high inflation driving even higher-income shoppers to search for the best deals, Walmart(NYSE: WMT) is winning market share from its higher-cost rivals.\n\nWalmart's shelves are well stocked with value-priced groceries and other household essentials. The retail giant's massive scale enables it to command the best prices from suppliers. It then passes much of these savings on to its customers, which drives strong, repeat traffic to its over 10,500 stores.\n\nThe discount retailer is also enjoying solid growth in its e-commerce businesses, driven by booming demand for curbside pickup and delivery services. After surging by 23% year over year in the quarter ended Jan. 31, Walmart's online sales now account for roughly 18% of its total revenue, or more than $100 billion annually.\n\nAdvertising is perhaps the company's most exciting growth driver. Walmart saw a 33% surge in its global ad sales in its most recent quarter. To further fuel the growth of this high-margin segment, Walmart struck a deal to acquire Vizio in February. Vizio's popular smart TVs and SmartCast operating system are expected to bolster Walmart's fast-growing digital ad offerings.\n\nWith its shares trading near all-time highs, Walmart decided to reward its shareholders with a 3-for-1 stock split on Feb. 23. With several powerful growth drivers powering its earnings growth, investors can safely expect this retail titan's stock price to continue to hit new highs in the coming years.\n\nStock split stock to buy No. 2: Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nLike Walmart, Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) has created fortunes for its long-term shareholders. But don't let that make the mistake of thinking this incredible growth story is nearing its end. The beloved restaurant chain has plenty of room for further expansion still ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle is admired for its high-quality ingredients and responsible sourcing strategies. The company also offers one of the most accelerated and highest-paying career paths in the restaurant industry -- employees can earn as much as $100,000 in annual compensation in as little as three years.\n\nBy appealing to consumers and job seekers alike, Chipotle has successfully grown its store count from a single location in 1993 to more than 3,400 restaurants today. CEO Brian Niccol sees a path to at least 7,000 stores in North America alone. Other international markets also beckon. Just days ago, Chipotle opened its first restaurant in Kuwait.\n\nImportantly, Chipotle's existing locations continue to grow more profitable. Its comparable restaurant sales rose by 7.9% in 2023, driven by traffic gains and price hikes. This impressive sales growth helped to drive the company's restaurant-level operating margin to 26.2%, up from 23.9% in 2022. Here, too, Niccol sees the potential for more gains. He's confident the burrito chain's average sales per restaurant can eventually rise to $4 million, up from about $3 million today.\n\nWith so much growth still ahead, Chipotle's stock remains a terrific buy today. Moreover, owning individual shares is likely to become more affordable this summer. The restaurant leader proposed a whopping 50-for-1 stock split, pending shareholder approval at its upcoming annual meeting in June. \"This is the first stock split in Chipotle's 30-year history, and we believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors,\" CFO Jack Hartung said in a press release.\n\nIf approved, Chipotle's stock split could be one of the largest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Buy today, and you could profit from the excitement surrounding this upcoming split. More importantly, buying Chipotle's stock now would position you to claim your share of this proven winner's long-term expansion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 24, 2024\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $13.37, expectations were $11.63. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good day and welcome to the Chipotle Mexican Grill First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCindy Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our investor relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for a discussion of risk that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.\n\nOur discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the investor relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Niccol : Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. The momentum in the business continued in the first quarter as we delivered 7% comp sales growth driven by over 5% transaction growth. Our strong sales trends were fueled by our focus on improving throughput in our restaurants, as well as successful marketing campaigns, including spotlighting Barbacoa and the return of Chicken Al Pastor as a limited time offer. For the quarter, sales grew 14% to reach $2.7 billion, driven by a 7% comp. In-store sales grew by 19% over last year, as throughput reached the highest levels in four years. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 27.5%, an increase of 190 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $13.37, representing 27% growth over last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd we opened 47 new restaurants, including 43 Chipotlanes. The strength in our business has continued into April, and as a result we are increasing our annual comp guidance and now estimate comps in the mid to high single digit range for the full year. Now let me shift to an update on our five key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future. These strategies include sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level. Running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering exceptional in restaurant and digital experiences. Making the brand visible, relevant, and loved to improve overall guest engagement, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity in our restaurants, support centers, and in our supply chain.\n\nAnd finally, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. I'll begin with our world-class people leadership. Last month, we held our All Manager Conference, where we brought together 4,500 of our restaurant and support center leaders to celebrate their success, as well as amplify our focus on exceptional people, exceptional food, and exceptional throughput. The conference included over 3,200 general managers, 100 apprentices, 450 field leaders, 60 team directors, and 11 regional vice presidents. For the first time, we also included crew members who have worked with us for over 20 years to celebrate their commitment and dedication to Chipotle. In fact one of our general managers in attendance from Denver, Colorado has been with Chipotle for 23 years and she also had four crew members from her restaurant who have each been with the company for over 20 years.\n\nCollectively, that is over 100 years of Chipotle experience, all at one restaurant, which is just incredible. And it's no surprise this restaurant has fantastic operations with throughput that is outperforming the overall company. At our conference, we highlighted the growth opportunity at Chipotle. To reach our long-term target of over 7,000 restaurants in North America, we showed our teams that we will need to double the number of field leadership positions we have. And as we target over 90% internal promotions, the majority of these future leaders will come from the GMs and apprentices at this conference. This was a powerful and motivating message and one that is unique to Chipotle given our scale, growth, and company-owned model. And in connection with our 50 to 1 stock split, we also announced that all of our GMs, as well as crew members who have been with Chipotle over 20 years will receive stock grants once the split is effective.\n\nThis will allow them to participate in the financial success of the company. Bottom-line, Chipotle is changing lives for the better. In fact, one of our restaurateurs and certified training managers, spoke at the conference and shared that her experience at Chipotle helped her to overcome financial hardship and that she was even on the verge of Homelessness before she joined Chipotle. She started as a crew member over 10 years ago and has thrived, making her way to the highest level GM and is now on her way to becoming a field leader. She was able to leverage her education benefits to earn a college degree, the first in her family, And utilizing the stock she received as a restaurateur, she was able to purchase her first home. She was also one of our team members that are behind the Foil commercials, as she really is a great example of the exceptional people that make Chipotle.\n\nIn addition to our world-class people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput are key areas of focus and are both critical to running our successful restaurants. We spent time at our All Manager Conference reminding our teams about Chipotle's culture of food with integrity and how there's a direct connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. We showcase Chipotle's food with integrity journey and our strong partnerships with our farmers and suppliers who take special care in assuring they are growing our food with the highest standards. We also emphasize the importance of teaching and tasting Chipotle, which means that our restaurant teams taste the food they prepare multiple times a day to assure it is delicious and meets our high standards.\n\nYou see Chipotle was founded on this idea of real food and real culinary, it's not a marketing slogan or a short-term initiative. It's in our heritage, it's in our DNA. Our restaurant teams take pride in our food and our healthy, high-quality eating experience adds value for our guests. In addition to our delicious food, exceptional throughput, or the speed of service in our restaurant, also adds to the extraordinary value proposition we offer. I am thrilled to share that the momentum and throughput continue to build in the first quarter as we improve by nearly two entrees in our peak 15 minutes compared to last year with each month showing an acceleration. At our All Manager Conference, we also focus on coaching the nuances of great throughput or executing what we call the four pillars.\n\nThis includes expo, or the crew member between [saucing and cash] (ph) to help expedite the bagging and payment process. Linebacker, typically the manager on duty who supplies both lines with freshly prepared food so that the crew on our line can continue to serve our guests without interruption, [meat and plus] (ph) or another way of saying that everything that is needed for a lunch or dinner peak is ready and in its place, and it is in their places, or having the best trained crew deployed in each position for lunch and dinner peaks. We're in the early innings of consistently executing the four pillars, but when we do, it creates a flywheel effect in our restaurants. The restaurants run more smoothly as our teams are properly trained and deployed, which allows them to keep up with demand without stress.\n\nThis leads to more stability and therefore, more experienced teams that execute better every day. And this can be seen in our latest turnover data, which is at historically low levels. And for our guests, faster throughput results in shorter, faster moving lines and hotter, fresher food, strengthening our value proposition and driving incremental transactions. Our restaurant in the financial district in Boston is a great example where a year ago they were doing mid-20 entrees in their peak 15 minutes. And today they are doing over 40 entrees in their peak 15 minutes with days that can reach as high as 80, which is among the highest in the company. The restaurant has low turnover and outsized transaction growth, which clearly demonstrates they are creating a better overall experience in the restaurant.\n\nNow turning to marketing. Our marketing team has started the year-off strong with outstanding brand advertising and menu innovation. We've continued our successful Behind the Foil brand campaign, showing our real teams, prepping our delicious fresh food by hand every day, reinforcing a key differentiator for Chipotle. This ran across all media channels, including high-profile placements in television, such as college football and the NFL playoffs. We also began to promote our delicious barbacoa, as we leveraged our consumer insights that told us that many of our guests did not know that barbacoa was Braised Beef. So we renamed it Braised Beef barbacoa and emphasized the culinary recipe, which is slow cooked, responsibly Braised Beef, seasoned with garlic and cumin, and hand shredded.\n\nIt was Chipotle's best kept secret and is now growing in popularity. The campaign was a success driving incremental transactions and spend, and it was simple for our operations team to execute since it was an existing menu item. This is a perfect example of how our marketing team continues to make Chipotle more visible, more relevant, and more loved. During the quarter, we also brought back one of our most requested new menu items, Chicken Al Pastor. Our guests loved our spin on the Al Pastor using our adobo chicken, morita peppers with a splash of pineapple, fresh lime, and hand chopped cilantro. Similar to Carne Asada, when we bring back a past favorite, we are able to improve the entire experience as we leverage our know-how across culinary, supply chain, marketing, and operations to make it more delicious with seamless execution. A chef plating up a wide variety of dishes for a restaurant chain.\n\nChicken Al Pastor is off to a great start once again, driving incremental transactions into our restaurants. Moving on to technology and innovation. Our marketing and digital teams continue to grow and evolve our rewards program, which recently celebrated its fifth anniversary. It is exciting that we now have a digital reach of about 40 million rewards members that we can leverage to increase engagement. Through our marketing initiatives, we continue to find successful ways to drive enrollments, and we are leveraging our digital team to create a seamless app experience and deliver more relevant journeys for our rewards members. The goal is to drive higher engagement in the program, which results in higher frequency and spend over time. In our restaurants, we continue to explore technology tools that could drive higher productivity and improve the overall experience for our teams.\n\nThis includes things like forecasting and deploying labor, recruiting new crew members, preparing our fresh food, and automating the preparation of digital orders. In fact, at our All Manager Conference, we showed our teams the latest version of our automated digital make line and Autocado, which cuts cores, and peels avocados. And as we discussed last quarter, we are excited to get both into a restaurant later this year as part of the stage gate process. Our final strategic priority is expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. We remain on track to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year, mostly in North America. We continue to see strength in openings across geographies and location types, including urban, suburban, and small towns.\n\nAdditionally, our development team is making progress to smooth the cadence of openings throughout the year with the number of restaurants under construction up meaningfully to last year. Outside of North America, I am delighted to share that we opened our first restaurant in Kuwait with the Alshaya Group, which marks the first time we've entered a new country in over 10 years. This was a highly collaborative effort between the Alshaya Group and our Chipotle teams across culinary, food safety, development, operations, and supply chain to successfully launch Chipotle in a brand new market with the same food quality standards and customer experience that we have in North America. Although it is very early, the opening was strong and we look forward to continued success and many restaurants across the region with the Alshaya Group.\n\nMoving to Europe, as you may recall, we brought over one of our top operators about a year ago who helped to identify areas of opportunity, including better aligning our training tools, systems, and culinary with our North American operations where it makes sense and is feasible. We have made nice progress aligning the culinary and are beginning to better align the operations, including a recent change in leadership structure as we expand the role of our Canadian leader to oversee both Canada and Europe. Over the last five years, Canada's economics have improved to be on par with the US. In fact, Canada is leading our company in many key operational KPIs, including throughput. The successful approach of aligning the local strategy with our overall operational vision and diligently overseeing execution of Chipotle standards has set up Canada for rapid expansion.\n\nWe see many similarities between the European operation today and the Canadian operation five years ago. The new leadership team in Europe, including two top operators from the US, will take a similar strategic approach to improve economics and unlock Europe's growth potential. In closing, the strength in our business, including transaction-driven comps, is due to the collective hard work of our 120,000 employees who are results-driven, passionate about our purpose of cultivating a better world, and excited for our growth opportunities ahead. At our All Manager Conference, I highlighted the importance of people development as it represents one of our greatest strengths. Seeing our leaders all in one place was inspiring, and their personal growth stories are a real and a key ingredient to Chipotle's success and future growth.\n\nThis makes me more confident than ever that we have the right people and the right strategy to achieve our long-term goals of more than doubling our restaurants in North America and expanding internationally. As I've said in the past, I believe the next Chipotle is Chipotle. And with that, I will turn it over to Jack.\n\nJack Hartung : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the first quarter grew 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion as sales comp grew 7%, driven by over 5% transaction growth. Restaurant level margin of 27.5% increased about 190 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $13.37, representing 27% year-over-year growth. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to an increase in legal reserves. As Brian mentioned, based on our strong underlying transaction trends, we are raising our full year comp guidance to the mid to high single digit range. We anticipate second quarter comps to be the highest of the year, which includes a benefit of an extra day from the Easter ship.\n\nAnd we anticipate comps to continue to be driven by transactions in the back half of the year. We do have some challenging rollover components, including Chicken Al Pastor, ending, lapping our menu price increase from the prior year, and rolling over the very successful Carne Asada campaign. With that said, we have a strong plan in place for the back half, both in terms of operations and marketing. Additionally, in April, minimum wage in California for restaurant companies like ours increased to $20 an hour. As a result, our wages in California went up by nearly 20%, and we subsequently took a 6% to 7% menu price increase in our California restaurants just to cover the cost in dollar terms. This will add almost a full point to total company pricing beginning in Q2.\n\nCalifornia restaurant cash flow is below the company average, so this increase will allow us to maintain cash flow. However, it will have a negative impact to overall company restaurant-level margin by about 20 basis points. I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 28.8%, a decrease of about 40 basis points from last year. The benefit of last year's menu price increase was partially offset by inflation across several ingredient costs, primarily beef and produce, and a protein mix headwind from the successful Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative. For Q2, we expect our cost of sales to be in the mid 29% range due to higher prices across several items, but most notably avocados, as we anticipate a step up from the low levels we have seen over the past several quarters.\n\nWe anticipate cost of sales inflation will be in the mid single digit range for the remainder of this year. Labor cost for the quarter were 24.4%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year as the benefit from sales leverage more than offset wage inflation and the higher performance base compensation. For Q2, we expect our labor costs to stay in the mid 24% range, with wage inflation stepping up to about 6% as a result of the minimum wage increase in California. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.3%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was driven by sales leverage, lower delivery expenses, and lower marketing and promo costs. Marketing and promo costs were 2.9% of sales in Q1, a decrease of about 30 basis points from last year.\n\nIn Q2, expect marketing costs to be in the low 2% range with the full year to come in just below 3%. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 13% range. G&A for the quarter was $204 million on a GAAP basis or $191 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding a $13 million increase in legal reserves. G&A also includes $126 million in underlying G&A, $34 million related to non-cash stock comp, $21 million related to our successful All Manager Conference we held in March, and $10 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vestings and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $129 million in Q2 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $36 million in Q2, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance.\n\nWe also expect to recognize around $6 million related to higher bonus accruals and employer taxes associated with share that vest during the quarter, bringing our total anticipated G&A in Q2 to around $171 million. Appreciation for the quarter was $83 million, or 3.1% of sales, and we expect appreciation to step up slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 22% for GAAP and 22.1% for non-GAAP. And our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and equity vesting above grant values. For fiscal 2024, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. On March 19th, we announced that our board of directors approved a 50-for-1 stock split, one of the largest in New York stock exchange history.\n\nWe believe this will make our stock more accessible to our employees, as well as a broader range of investors. Pending shareholder approval in early June to increase the number of authorized shares, the stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on Wednesday, June 26. Our balance sheet remains strong, as we enter the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. As a result of the timing of our announcement of the stock split, we were unable to repurchase shares for most of the quarter, which limited our share repurchases to just $25 million, an average price of $2,320. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $400 million remaining under our share authorization program, and we will be able to resume opportunistically repurchasing our shares when the window reopens in a few days.\n\nWe opened 47 new restaurants in the first quarter, of which 43 had a Chipotlane. And we continue to anticipate opening between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024, with over 80% having a [Chipotlane] (ph). And we remain on track to move toward the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming timeline conditions do not worsen. To close, I want to reiterate the message I shared at our recent All Manager Conference, [fully] (ph) started over 30 years ago with a young chef who thought just because food is served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. That evolved into our food integrity journey, defying the traditional fast food model by investing more in our ingredients and shaping our economic model to help fund that investment.\n\nAnd today we have a special brand and unique economic model that allows us to spend more on our ingredients, yet remain one of the most affordable meals in the industry, while also maintaining industry-leading margins. These three characteristics are incredibly difficult to replicate. Premium ingredients, affordable prices, and attractive margins. And this is a huge competitive advantage. And as we continue to protect and strengthen our economic model, the future looks very bright for Chipotle. And with that, we're happy to answer your questions.\n\nSee also\n\n20 Most Powerful Drag Queens In The US and\n\n20 Biggest Gold Companies in Australia in 2024.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 April 26, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Oracle Corp. ORCL, HSBC Holdings plc HSBC, RTX Corp. RTX, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard & Analyst Reports for Oracle, HSBC and RTX\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q1 earnings, in addition to the usual new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Oracle Corp., HSBC Holdings plc and RTX Corp.. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nQ1 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding this morning's reports from Caterpillar and others, we now have Q1 results from 190 S&P 500 members or 38% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +1.1% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 58.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe EPS beats percentage of 77.9% compares to 80% for this group of companies in the preceding period and high-low range of 88.9% and 66.3%, with a 5-year average of 79.3%.\n\nThe revenue beats percentage of 58.9% for this group of 190 index members compares to 63.2% in the preceding period and the high-low range of the preceding 20 quarters of 86.3% and 58.9%, with an average of 69.1%.\n\nWhat this means is that at this stage in the Q1 reporting cycle, the revenue beats percentage for this group of 190 companies is at the lowest level in the last 5 years.\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals for the 190 companies that have reported with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are now expected to be up only +2.4% on +3.9% higher revenues.\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q2), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues.\n\nEstimates have been steadily going up since the quarter got underway, with Energy, Transportation and Finance as among the 7 Zacks sectors enjoying favorable revisions trend since the start of April.\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nOracle shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+10.2% vs. +6.1%). The company is gaining from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database offerings. The solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP bodes well.\r\n\r\nOracle's Gen 2 Cloud is delivering better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. ORCL's continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. The company's share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, higher spending on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform amid increasing competition in the cloud domain, is likely to limit margin expansion.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of HSBC have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry over the year-to-date period (+7.0% vs. +3.3%). The company's strong capital position, higher interest rates, an extensive network and business restructuring initiatives will keep aiding it. HSBC's efforts to improve market share in the Asia region will support financials in the long run, this will likely lead to a rise in near-term expenses. Because of its growth strategy and higher technology-related expenses, HSBC expects 2024 expense growth of 5%.\r\n\r\nHowever, HSBC has already exited retail operations in the United States, Canada, France, New Zealand and Greece and is in the process of fully exiting Russia. In order to focus more on Asia, the company is set to acquire Citigroup's wealth business in China. The current challenging macroeconomic backdrop is another major near-term headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on HSBC here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past six months (+29.4% vs. -0.5%). The company ended first-quarter 2024 on a bright note, with both its sales and earnings surpassing their respective consensus estimate. RTX continues to receive ample orders from the Pentagon and its foreign allies for its wide range of combat-proven defense products.\r\n\r\nA steadily recovering commercial air traffic is expected to bolster commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for the company. RTX holds a solid financial position, which should enable it to make a successful share repurchase.\r\n\r\nHowever, rising crude prices tend to put cost pressure on airlines, and operating results of commercial OEM producers like RTX may be impacted. The company might also be affected if China enforces its announced sanctions against RTX's missile and defense unit.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on RTX here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc..\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Now to Ride the Wave of Robust Wage Growth",
        "content": "Americans\u2019 average hourly earnings rose 0.6% more than inflation between March 2023 and March 2024. Since the Consumer Price Index climbed 3.5% year-over-year (YOY) last month, we can infer that Americans\u2019 actual average wage increased 4.1% YOY in March. Since 2021, there have been similar hikes in our compensation. Many firms, including restaurant chains, advertisers, companies in the travel sector and large retail chains, have benefited from these wage hikes. Indeed, since the U.S. economy is primarily based on consumption, I believe that these compensation gains are the key reason why the nation has avoided the recession that so many were sure would be caused by the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases. Moreover, the wage gains are also largely responsible for the stock market\u2019s attainment of new all-time highs this year. With that said, here are three stocks to buy to profit from U.S. wage growth.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurant chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is clearly getting a huge boost from U.S. compensation hikes. The company\u2019s first-quarter revenue jumped 14% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $2.7 billion, while its comparable restaurant sales jumped 7% year-over-year.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, its operating margin came in at 16.3% last quarter versus 15.5% in Q1 of 2023 and its earnings per share soared an incredible 23.9% YOY to $13.01. The company was able to increase the average amount spent by its customers by 1.6% YOY.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, CMG continues to expand, as it opened 47 new restaurants in Q1. The company added that a number of its \u201cmarketing initiatives\u201d proved to be quite successful.\n\nWith Chipotle\u2019s offerings obviously clicking with consumers and the firm growing rapidly and benefiting from consumers\u2019 wage growth, I expect CMG stock to easily outperform the stock market going forward, making it an ideal option among stocks to buy.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAmericans\u2019 wage growth and the resulting, strong economic growth that the country has experienced have led marketers in recent months to spend much more on ads than they did in 2022 and the first half of 2023.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), which gets the lion\u2019s share of its revenue and profits through advertising, has been a major beneficiary of this trend. For example, in the fourth quarter of last year, its top line came in at $86.3 billion, up from $76 billion in Q4 of 2022., while it generated $24.9 billion of operating income, versus $18.16 billion during the same period a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a note to investors on April 17, Truist, a U.S. bank, predicted that GOOG would report \u201csolid\u201d Q1 results, driven by strong engagement trends which have, in turn, triggered increased ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nIn other words, consumers, flush with increased funds from wage growth ,are clicking more on Alphabet\u2019s paid ads, causing its top line to surge.\n\nTruist, which hiked its price target on GOOG stock to $170 from $158, expects the company\u2019s Q1 results to come in slightly above analysts\u2019 average estimates.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) delivered very strong Q1 results which demonstrated that it\u2019s been a major beneficiary of Americans\u2019 wage growth.\n\nThe automaker\u2019s net income surged a very impressive 24% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $2.98 billion, while its automotive operating cash flow soared 61% year-over-year to $3.6 billion.\n\nMoreover, GM increased its 2024 EPS guidance to $9-$10, versus its previous target of $8.50-$9.50.\n\nMultiple Wall Street analysts were pleased with the company\u2019s results and bullish on the outlook of this option among stocks to buy.\n\nFor example, Swiss bank UBS, calling GM one of the best names in the auto sector, increased its price target on the name to $58. Meanwhile Japanese bank Mizuho, lauding the company\u2019s position within the SUV and pickup truck market, hiked its price target on the name to $52.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "The S&P 500 has been a solid index for long-term investors. Some years are better than others, but the index has generally moved upward in the long run. The index\u2019s 5-year, 10-year, 20-year and 40-year returns all paint a picture of progress. Looking deeper into the popular index can reveal opportunities to outperform the stock market. While investors can look at the Magnificent Seven stocks for opportunities to outperform the index, you have probably heard of those stocks for a while. Variety is the spice of life, and these are some of the top S&P 500 stocks that aren\u2019t members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nMarriott International (MAR) Marriott logo in Milan, Italy. MAR stock.\n\nSource: DELBO ANDREA / Shutterstock\n\nMarriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 with a 75% gain over the past five years. The hotel chain is also off to a great start,\u00a0with\u00a0an 8% year-to-date gain.\n\nMarriott offers growth at a reasonable price. The company trades at a 23 P/E ratio while paying a quarterly dividend. The stock has a 0.87% yield and\u00a0hiked its dividend by 30% in 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe hotel chain reported 12% year-over-year revenue growth and 26% year-over-year net income growth in\u00a0Q4 2023. The firm\u2019s profit margin exceeded 50%. Marriott is currently rated as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d with a projected 5% upside. The highest price target of $280/share suggests the stock can rally 17% from current levels.\n\nMarriott initiated a $3.9 billion stock buyback in 2023. The company repurchased 21.5 million shares during that buyback. The company returned $4.5 billion to shareholders,\u00a0including\u00a0dividends.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on it\n\nSource: astudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has outperformed the stock market with a 161% gain over the past five years. The company trades at an 18 P/E ratio while offering a 1.50% dividend yield. The annualized dividend growth rate is 8.20% over the past decade.\n\nThe company offers an essential service. Construction equipment is required for many projects. While higher interest rates can slow construction, it\u2019s a constant need for many businesses, states and countries. Caterpillar has been around for almost 100 years and has withstood various economic cycles like the Great Depression and the 1973 Oil Crisis.\n\nCaterpillar recently released another solid quarter of earnings. The firm\u2019s\u00a0Q4 2023 results indicated 3% year-over-year revenue growth and 84% year-over-year net income growth. Caterpillar set records for full-year sales, adjusted profits per share and ME&T free cash flow. The company returned $7.5 billion to shareholders via stock buybacks and dividends throughout 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is up by 330% over the past five years and is gaining renewed attention thanks to an upcoming stock split. Investors will receive 50 shares for every share of Chipotle that they currently own.\n\nThe historic 50-for-1 stock split will make shares more accessible to investors and increase options trading activity. While investors can buy fractional shares right now, they may feel more eager to buy shares if they can have entire shares of a company rather than a fractional one.\n\nChipotle has a lot going for it beyond the stock split. Revenue increased by 15.4% year-over-year in\u00a0Q4 2023. The company has regularly achieved double-digit revenue growth, and profit margins have also been improving. The restaurant chain increased its diluted earnings per share by 27.3% year-over-year.\n\nWhile the restaurant firm is growing, another key advantage is the company\u2019s pricing power. Chipotle has maintained a steady stream of loyal customers despite\u00a0raising its prices six times over the past three years. Few companies can attract more customers while raising prices once a year, let alone six. Chipotle looks ready to deliver enticing long-term returns for patient investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Uber Technologies and RE/MAX have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 April 26, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Uber Technologies, Inc. UBER as the Bull of the Day and RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. RMAX as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG, Wingstop WING and CAVA Group CAVA.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. posted its first full-year profit as a public company in 2023 by expanding its ride-hailing and delivery businesses while streamlining its operations at every turn.\n\nWall Street rewarded Uber by sending its stock to new all-time highs in February, soaring 130% over the last 12 months.\n\nUber shares have cooled off to trade at attractive levels for long-term investors given its impressive outlook in segments of the economy it transformed from a niche app for people in select cities into a $50 billion-a-year behemoth.\n\nA Transformational 2023\n\nUber posted fourth-quarter profit of $1.43 billion, including a $1 billion benefit from its equity investments. The ride-hailing firm reported $652 million of income from operations vs. a loss of $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Uber's Q4 operating income also surged by $258 million quarter-over-quarter.\n\nOn top of that, Uber's Q4 free cash flow hit $768 million vs. a negative cash flow of -$303 million in the final quarter of 2022. This came after Uber posted its first-ever quarterly operating profit in the second quarter of last year.\n\nCEO Dara Khosrowshahi called 2023 an \"inflection point\" proving Uber can \"continue to generate strong, profitable growth at scale.\"\n\nUber spent the last several years cutting jobs and streamlining its operations, always pivoting toward profitable expansion amid a wild ride for its business that saw ride-hailing briefly fade during Covid and food delivery soar. The company's strength in its core mobility and delivery segments are offsetting struggles in its much smaller freight unit.\n\nUber's results over the last several years highlight that people are back to living their pre-pandemic lives in full force. Crucially, the resurgence of its ride-hailing segment hasn't come at the expense of delivery, showcasing the strength of its two core business models that are especially popular with higher-income consumers who are less impacted by lingering inflation and various economic cycles.\n\nUber grew its monthly active platform consumers by 15% YoY in the fourth quarter to 150 million, fueled by growth across mobility (ride-hailing) and delivery. Total trips soared 24% YoY to 2.6 billion in Q4, while mobility gross bookings jumped 29% YoY to $19.3 billion and delivery surged 19% to $17 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nUber, under Khosrowshahi, has focused heavily on disciplined spending and cost-cutting measures. Uber offers far fewer discounts to consumers and incentives to drivers these days. Uber is reducing delivery errors and becoming more efficient while boosting its market share vs. rival Lyft and others.\n\nOn top of that, Uber is rolling out more advertisements across its core Uber app, Uber Eats, and beyond to help monetize its growing customer base for ride-hailing and delivery. Uber also heavily scaled back on its in-house autonomous vehicle dreams in favor of a strategic partnership with Waymo for self-driving ride-hailing.\n\nUber in December announced a new partnership with autonomous trucking firm and independent subsidiary of Daimler Truck AG, Torc Robotics. Uber is prepared to compete against or possibly with the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and others in the autonomous ride-hailing, delivery, and freight space down the road.\n\nGrowth Ahead\n\nUber grew its revenue by 17% in 2023, even as it came up against an impossible to compete against stretch of 83% sales growth in 2022 and 56% in 2021. The ride-hailing company is projected to post another 16% growth in 2024 and 2025 to hit $50.49 billion next year\u2014vs. $13 billion in pre-Covid 2019.\n\nIts total gross bookings are projected to surge 19% in 2024, based on Zacks data. Meanwhile, its monthly active platform consumers are expected to climb 13% to 169 million.\n\nUber swung from an adjusted loss of -$4.65 a share in 2022 to +$0.87 per share last year. The company is expected to post 40% adjusted EPS growth in 2024 and another 67% in FY25 to reach $2.04 per share.\n\nUber crushed our Q4 EPS estimate by 340% ($0.66 vs. $0.15). Its consensus FY24 EPS estimate has climbed by 97% over the last year, with its outlook for FY25 up 20%. The firm's overall upbeat EPS revisions help it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.\n\nOther Fundamentals\n\nUber stock has soared around 130% over the last year to break above its 2021 highs to a record of around $82 a share in mid-February. During the same stretch, its rival Lyft climbed 60%, future possible robot taxi rival Tesla moved 7% higher, and tech popped 40%.\n\nUber is now up 70% over the last five years vs. Lyft's 70% downturn. The stock has pulled back from its highs, trading 14% below its records and 23% below its average Zacks price target.\n\nUber is currently trying to find support at its 21-week moving average, where the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq found support to start the week. Uber fell from its most overbought RSI levels in February to neutral.\n\nUber's valuation is improving. The stock trades at a 50% discount to its highs at 3.2X forward sales and 30% below the Zacks tech sector. Plus, its PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 0.9 vs. tech's 1.8.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSome investors might want to wait until after Uber reports its first quarter 2024 financial results on May 8 before they consider buying the stock.\n\nLong-term investors are often well served to forget the market timing game. Plus, Wall Street loves the stock, with 34 of the 40 brokerage recommendations Zacks has at \"Strong Buys,\" alongside no \"Sells.\"\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nRE/MAX Holdings, Inc. is a global real estate firm and one of the largest franchisors in the real estate industry. RMAX stock has continued to suffer as the company's earnings outlook tumbled over the last several years.\n\nRMAX 101\n\nRE/MAX franchises real estate brokerages globally under the RE/MAX brand and mortgage brokerages in the U.S. under Motto Mortgage. The firm also sells supplementary products and services to our franchise networks, including loan processing services.\n\nRE/MAX boasts that it has more than 140,000 agents in over 9,000 offices across over 110 countries. That said, RE/MAX and Motto Mortgage are 100% franchised. The company's business revolves around providing technology, training, and marketing.\n\nRE/MAX posted strong growth in three out of the past five years, including 33% revenue expansion in the pre-Covid 2019 period and 24% in 2021.\n\nRE/MAX's revenue fell 8% in 2023 and its adjusted earnings tumbled 38%. The firm has been impacted by the slowing housing market, driven by higher mortgage rates and a difficult to compete against stretch of pull-forward expansion during the Covid boom.\n\nRE/MAX's adjusted earnings are projected to fall another 7% in 2024 on 5% lower sales amid rough macro conditions. RE/MAX's earnings outlook has faded fast over the last several years, including recent negativity.\n\nFor instance, RE/MAX's Q1 FY24 consensus EPS estimate is down 17% in the last several months, with its most accurate/recent EPS estimate slightly below that beaten-down level.\n\nThe company's long-term outlook likely remains strong, driven by larger demographic trends. The firm is also optimistic about the near term future. \"Looking ahead to 2024, we believe there are many reasons to be optimistic \u2013 encouraging interest rate trends, improving customer sentiment, and ongoing pent-up demand bode well for progressively better housing market performance moving forward,\" CEO Erik Carlson (who took over in late 2023) said in prepared Q4 remarks.\n\nBottom Line\n\nRE/MAX's downward earnings revisions help it earn a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment. On top of that the company's Real Estate \u2013 Operations segment lands in the bottom 13% of over 250 Zacks industries.\n\nWall Street is skeptical of the stock at the moment, with four of the six brokerage recommendations Zacks has at \"Holds,\" alongside two \"Sells.\" The stock is down over 80% in the last five years, including a 60% downturn in the past 12 months. This fall is part of an even larger decline that began in 2017.\n\nRE/MAX will report its earnings results on Thursday, May 2.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nChipotle's Q1 Beat Heats Up Restaurant Stocks\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill reported earnings Wednesday after the market close and did not disappoint shareholders.\n\nChipotle had another stellar quarter of business activity, growing revenues 14.1% YoY, increasing margins, and opening 47 new restaurants with 43 including a Chipotlane, a drive through option.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is an innovator in the restaurant space, commercializing the fast-casual concept and leading the way for the industry. Shareholders have benefitted tremendously from Chipotle's success as the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 19.7%, well above the broad market and industry.\n\nWith analyst beating earnings, and a top Zacks Rank Chipotle Mexican Grill makes for a worthy consideration in any investor's portfolio. Additionally, several other up and coming restaurant stocks offer huge opportunities, and the sector as a whole has shown relative strength during the recent market selloff.\n\nHere we will cover Chipotle's earnings and share two other top ranked restaurant stocks to dive into.\n\nEarnings Results\n\nChipotle reported a strong first quarter with revenue up 14.1% to $2.7 billion. Comparable restaurant sales grew 7%, driven by higher transactions and menu price increases. Profits were also strong, with adjusted earnings per share up 27.3% to $13.37.\n\nEarnings beat analysts' estimates by 14.5% and sales by 1.2%.\n\nThe company is optimistic about the future, citing successful marketing initiatives and a focus on throughput. They are expecting full-year comparable restaurant sales growth in the mid to high-single digits and plan to open 285 to 315 new restaurants.\n\nMargins saw notable expansion as well, with operating margin rising from 15.5% to 16.3% from last quarter.\n\nIs Chipotle a Buy?\n\nAs of today, Chipotle shows continued growth on both the top and bottom line as it cements its leadership in the space. It boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and forecasts EPS to grow 22% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nAdditionally, as noted, CMG stock has been displaying relative strength against the broad market, indicating a preference for the stock from institutional investors.\n\nOther High-Flying Restaurant Stocks\n\nThe sector has been performing quite well broadly, and a handful of new restaurant stocks have been putting up huge rallies.\n\nTwo stocks which have gone public more recently and are posting impressive growth are Wingstop and CAVA Group.\n\nWhile Wingstop is a more traditional chicken wing take-out and eat it restaurant, CAVA Group has been following the Chipotle model very closely. Cava restaurants have similar industrial design, restaurant layout and pricing to the incumbent Chipotle and showing that the setup works.\n\nCAVA Group is expecting sales to grow 19% annually this year and next and is also forecasting net positive earnings results for the first time in the coming quarter.\n\nBoth Cava and Wingstop have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating and are up significantly more YTD in terms of stock price.\n\nWingstop is forming an especially compelling technical trade setup. Over the last two months, the price action on WING stock has been building out a bull flag. If the stock can trade above the $375 level, it would signal a technical breakout.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGeneral wisdom usually says that restaurants are a poor business, however the stocks shared here would say otherwise. Chipotle has been one of the top performers in the market over the last decade, and both Cava and Wingstop are showing huge potential with near-term bullish catalysts.\n\nIt is also worth noting that amid the worst selloff in nearly six months, these restaurant stocks are showing relative strength against the broader market. Stocks that show strength while the market is down are usually the ones that lead during the next bull run.\n\nFor investors looking to diversify into restaurant stocks, Chipotle, Wingstop and Cava all make for worthwhile considerations.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "The Top 3 Under-$10 Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "When it comes to stocks, price matters. While most analysts concentrate on valuation, i.e. the price-to-earnings estimates, for retail investors the price at which shares can be purchased is of paramount importance. A lot of investors, for example, can\u2019t afford to buy a single share of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) right now with the stock trading at close to $3,000. However, after the company completes a 50-for-1 stock split in June and the price is lowered to less than $60, these investors will be able to snap up shares.\n\nMany investors with little cash on hand rightfully look for stocks that trade for less than $10 a share, enabling them to build a decent position in their portfolio. If a stock that has a low share price also has a compelling valuation and offers a dividend payout, then the stars may have aligned and you could have the makings of a great long-term investment. The key is to do one\u2019s homework and carefully evaluate a stock before buying it. Here are the top three under-$10 stocks to buy in April 2024.\n\nBarclays (BCS) the Barclays (BCS) logo\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock.com\n\nBritish bank Barclays (NYSE:BCS) is currently trading near a 52-week high but is still available for purchase at just under $10 per share. BCS stock is currently trading at $9.60 a share. Not only is the low share price attractive, but so too is the valuation and yield. Barclays trades at just seven times future earnings estimates and offers its shareholders a quarterly dividend payment of 10 cents per share, giving BCS stock a strong yield of 4.19%. Barclays\u2019 shares are also on an upswing, having gained 21% so far in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBCS stock has been trending higher ever since the bank announced in February a strategic overhaul of its operations. The changes include cost cuts, asset sales, and a reorganization of its business divisions. Going forward, the 128-year-old bank will be divided into five operating units, separating the corporate and investment banking sides of the lender. Management said they are targeting cost savings of \u00a32 billion (US$2.5 billion) by 2026.\n\nBarclays also announced an additional share buyback of \u00a31 billion and promised to return \u00a310 billion to shareholders by 2026 through dividends and stock repurchases.\n\nKinross Gold Corp.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stock that is moving in the right direction but can still be had for less than 10 bucks is Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC). Shares are currently trading at $6.56, but are up 30% in the past 12 months, including a year-to-date gain of 10%. KGC stock has been rising alongside the price of gold, which has hit multiple all-time highs in recent months. Currently trading at $2,335 an ounce, gold\u2019s price was sitting at a record high of $2,431.55 earlier in April.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strong rise in the price of bullion has lifted the fortunes of gold miners such as Kinross. Expectations are for Kinross and others to make hay while the sun shines and post strong financial results on the back of record prices. Prior to this year, KGC stock had struggled after the company divested a gold mine in Ghana and sold its Russian mining assets following that country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. However, sentiment towards Kinross has now shifted to the positive.\n\nBeyond the share price appreciation, KGC stock trades at 19 times future earnings estimates and pays a quarterly dividend of 3 cents per share, giving it a yield of 1.83%.\n\nSirius XM Holdings (SIRI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of US broadcasting company Sirius XM Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIs there a role for satellite radio into today\u2019s world of audio streaming? Warren Buffett seems to think so. The Oracle of Omaha currently owns more than 40 million shares of Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI), the company that has a virtual monopoly over satellite radio services. Buffett\u2019s stake in Sirius is worth $127.6 million, and despite SIRI stock steadily falling, the world\u2019s greatest investor remains a shareholder. Like Barclays, Sirius XM Holdings is cheap to buy.\n\nSIRI stock currently has a share price of $3.16, a forward P/E ratio of 9.76x, and a dividend yield of 3.36%. For value investors who like to bottom fish, Sirius XM Holdings\u2019 stock is currently near a 52-week low, having fallen 42% this year. The company has struggled with disappointing earnings and concerns have been raised about its growth potential given that most of its customers only listen to the radio network in their car. But some analyst are turning bullish.\n\nPivotal Research recently upgraded the stock to a \u201cbuy\u201d rating from \u201chold\u201d previously and placed a $4.90 price target on the stock, implying 55% upside from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Decoding Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) showcases robust revenue growth and increased net income in Q1 2024. Strategic expansion with 47 new restaurants, including 43 with a Chipotlane, aligns with consumer convenience trends. CMG's commitment to high-quality ingredients and customer experience solidifies its market position. Operational efficiency improvements contribute to a decrease in restaurant operating costs as a percentage of total revenue.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with CMG.\n\nOn April 25, 2024, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) filed its 10-Q report, revealing a comprehensive overview of its financial performance and strategic initiatives for the first quarter of the year. CMG, a leader in the fast-casual dining sector, has reported a 14.1% increase in total revenue, reaching $2.7 billion, compared to the same period in the previous year. The company's net income also saw a significant rise, climbing to $359.3 million, up from $291.6 million. This financial growth is a testament to CMG's enduring appeal and operational prowess in the competitive restaurant industry. Decoding Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nRobust Financial Growth: CMG's financial performance in the first quarter of 2024 underscores its solid market position. With a 14.1% increase in total revenue and a 23.2% rise in net income, the company demonstrates its ability to drive sales and manage costs effectively. The growth in diluted earnings per share to $13.01, up from $10.50, reflects CMG's profitability and its potential to deliver value to shareholders. This financial strength provides CMG with the capital necessary to invest in new initiatives and sustain its expansion efforts.\n\nExpanding Footprint with Innovative Formats: CMG's strategic expansion is evident in its addition of 47 new restaurants, with a significant number featuring the Chipotlane format. This drive-thru innovation caters to the growing consumer demand for convenience and speed, positioning CMG favorably against competitors. The company's plan to open 285-315 new restaurants in 2024, with at least 80% including a Chipotlane, demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to growth and customer service.\n\nCommitment to Quality and Customer Experience: CMG's brand is built on a foundation of high-quality ingredients and a focus on customer experience. The company's dedication to sourcing fresh, quality produce and meats resonates with health-conscious consumers and differentiates CMG from other fast-casual dining options. This commitment not only enhances customer loyalty but also supports a pricing strategy that can absorb cost fluctuations without significantly impacting customer demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLabor Cost Vulnerability: CMG's labor costs, while managed effectively, remain a potential vulnerability. The recent minimum wage increase in California to $20 per hour has led to a nearly 20% increase in labor costs for CMG's California operations. Although the company has mitigated this impact through menu price adjustments, continued wage inflation could pressure profit margins and necessitate further price increases, which may affect customer perception and demand.\n\nDependence on U.S. Market: Despite its international presence, CMG's operations are heavily concentrated in the United States. This geographic concentration exposes the company to risks associated with the U.S. economy, including regional economic downturns and changes in consumer spending patterns. Diversifying its global footprint could help CMG reduce its reliance on the U.S. market and tap into growth opportunities in emerging economies.\n\nOperational Risks: CMG's operational model, which emphasizes fresh ingredients and made-to-order meals, presents challenges in maintaining consistency and speed of service across all locations. Any lapses in food quality or service can quickly affect brand reputation, as seen in past food safety incidents. Continuous investment in training and quality control is essential to mitigate these operational risks.\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechnological Advancements: CMG has the opportunity to further leverage technology to enhance the customer experience and operational efficiency. Investments in digital ordering platforms, mobile apps, and restaurant automation can streamline operations, reduce wait times, and cater to the growing demand for contactless transactions. CMG's involvement with Vebu Inc., a developer of restaurant automation technology, indicates a strategic move towards integrating innovative solutions.\n\nMenu Innovation: CMG can capitalize on consumer trends by continuously innovating its menu offerings. The introduction of new and limited-time offerings, such as the Braised Beef Barbacoa, can attract new customers and encourage repeat visits. Additionally, expanding plant-based and dietary-specific options could appeal to a broader customer base and align with evolving dietary preferences.\n\nInternational Expansion: CMG has the opportunity to expand its international presence, particularly in markets with growing middle-class populations and an appetite for Western dining concepts. Strategic partnerships, like the development agreement with Alshaya Group in the Middle East, can facilitate entry into new markets and contribute to global brand recognition and revenue diversification.\n\nThreats\n\nCompetitive Market: The fast-casual dining sector is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. CMG faces competition from both established chains and emerging concepts, which can erode its customer base and pressure margins. Staying ahead requires continuous innovation, marketing, and maintaining the high-quality standards that define the CMG brand.\n\nCommodity Price Volatility: As a company that prides itself on using fresh ingredients, CMG is susceptible to fluctuations in commodity prices. Increases in the costs of key ingredients, such as beef and produce, can impact profitability. While CMG employs various pricing protocols with suppliers to mitigate this risk\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Chipotle (CMG) expects Americans to keep shelling out for steak bowls and chicken quesadillas even as overall spending slows down.\n\n\"When consumers are under pressure, if we're executing at a high level, customers tend to keep Chipotle in their budget longer\" than other items, CFO Jack Hartung told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIn the first quarter, US GDP expanded at a 1.6% annualized pace, a slower pace than the Street had expected. But Hartung, whose company just posted a stellar Q1 earnings report, said the health of its consumers has been \"so far, so good,\" despite macro headwinds.\n\nFor Chipotle's Q1, revenue grew 14.1% to $2.7 billion, with same-store sales jumping by 7%. The company also beat expectations on the bottom line, with adjusted earnings per share coming in at $13.37, compared to estimates of $11.66.\n\nLimited-time offers like Chicken al Pastor, which is priced at a premium, helped boost results. The chain saw a 5.4% increase in foot traffic, though the average check was only up 1.6%, lower than the 2% Wall Street expected.\n\nFor 2024, Chipotle expects sales growth of mid- to high-single digits, up from the previous guidance of mid-single-digit growth.\n\nFollowing the results, the company had one of the most active ticker pages on Yahoo Finance. The stock had its best day since Feb. 7 and closed at a record high.\n\nAs consumers start to think twice about their purchases, Hartung said the chain is seeing diners across income levels continuing to visit the restaurants.\n\n\"Low, medium, or high [income], they're spending at the same level, they're increasing their purchase, their visits,\" Hartung said. \"I know there's other patterns out there, but so far, I think Chipotle is affordable.\"\n\nThat value proposition is something that Wall Street has keyed in on as well.\n\n\"We expect sales momentum to continue for the foreseeable future, with second quarter 2024 same-store sales and traffic higher than the first quarter owing to several factors, and believe same-store sales could end the year near the high-end of its outlook,\" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh wrote in a note to clients.\n\nUBS analyst Dennis Geiger said in a client note that Chipotle's \"impressive results are likely to standout in what could be a difficult quarter for the industry,\" adding that the 7% sales growth was in part supported by a \"compelling value proposition.\" Workers help a customer at a Chipotle restaurant on April 1, 2024, in San Rafael, Calif. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nIn March, Chipotle's board of directors approved a 50-for-1 stock split, the biggest in New York Stock Exchange history. It needs to get shareholder approval on June 6. The move will make the stock, which has shot up 360% in the past five years, more accessible to the average retail investor.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Chipotle (CMG) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of mexican fast-food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) jumped 7.3% in the afternoon session after the company reported a \"beat and raise\" quarter. Fourth quarter results beat analysts' expectations for same-store sales, revenue, gross margin, and EPS. Notably, the results benefited from new restaurant openings (47 new restaurants in Q1), while comparable sales growth was driven by higher transactions(+5.4%) and an increase in average checks (+1.6% ). Moving on, full-year guidance for comparable store sales was raised from a mid-single digit year-on-year percentage increase to a mid to high-single-digit percentage increase. Zooming out, we think this was a great quarter that shareholders will appreciate.\n\nIs now the time to buy Chipotle? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nChipotle's shares are not very volatile than the market average and over the last year have had only 3 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago, when the company gained 8.4% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, same-store sales, and EPS exceeding analysts' estimates. The company's outperformance was driven by strong year-on-year unit growth of 7.4%. It also got a pricing tailwind of 1.0% and opened more restaurants in the quarter than expected (121 vs estimates of 117).\n\nA highlight of Chipotle's 2023 was that it formed its first international partnership with franchisee Alshaya Group in the Middle East. Should the company lean into franchising more going forward, financial performance could improve since the franchise model generally yields higher-margin royalty revenue and requires less capital investments. Looking ahead, Chipotle expects same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits for 2024, along with 300 new store openings. Overall, this was a fantastic quarter that should have shareholders cheering.\n\nChipotle is up 39% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Chipotle's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,601.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Chipotle is\u00a0simultaneously cutting costs and avocados as it green-lights\u00a0robots\u00a0to\u00a0make your guacamole",
        "content": "Chipotle is about to get some robotic help to cut both costs and avocados. News of an Autocado robot first arose last summer, as the fast-food company looked to robots to cut, core, and peel avocados before a human takes on the mashing part for Chipotle\u2019s signature guacamole. And the robot unveiling is imminent, according to the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings.\n\nCEO Brian Niccol led a pretty chipper call, saying company sales \u201cgrew by 14% to reach $2.7 billion,\u201d boosted by the return of popular menu items like chicken al pastor. Earlier this month, some speculated fast-food companies would be in hot water following California\u2019s new $20 minimum-wage law, but Chipotle\u2019s recent earnings shows companies can afford to maintain profits and pay workers well\u2014they just have to be smart about how they adjust.\n\nOne such effort is using robots alongside workers. \u201cIn our restaurants, we continue to explore technology tools that could drive higher productivity and improve the overall experience for our teams,\u201d Niccol said. This avocado masher could be one such way to reduce costs and increase productivity while paying workers more. The company is looking to use \"robotics and AI and finding other ways to do productivity,\u201d he added.\n\nNiccol also said he\u2019s \u201cfeeling really good about getting those into a restaurant probably in the back half of this year.\u201d So get ready for some robot-human-hybrid guac. Currently, the CEO boasted of some of the lowest turnovers the company has seen.\n\nOf course, such tools can sometimes make workers nervous about their jobs being outsourced or encroached upon as managers look for a deal rather than paying their team what they\u2019re worth. For instance, Wendy\u2019s recently implemented AI in its drive-thrus, and vegan takeout company Kernel hired a six-axis robot arm to add veggie burgers to the assembly line. Of course, it doesn\u2019t always go without a hitch, as Chipotle itself stopped using its tortilla-chip AI machine because it was too difficult to clean. But in general, fast-food companies are on the frontline of adding in these AI services, and many have found a way to keep both humans and robots living in peace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they are necessarily reducing the number of people,\u201d Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore told Fortune\u2019s Sasha Rogelberg of these AI tools. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they\u2019re making those people more productive and happier,\u201d she added, explaining in a note that automated tools cut down on labor costs, which account on average for 36% of restaurant\u2019s costs.\n\nEmbracing new technological innovations is just one way chains can stay afloat under new state laws. They also can afford to raise their prices a bit, as Chipotle said it raised its menu prices by 6% to 7% in California.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver this past year, in-store sales at Chipotle soared by 19% as the brand saw gains with consumers of all income brackets. It seems as if while some people might grumble a bit at an extra dollar for queso, the demand is still there and customers are willing to pay more.\n\n\u201cWe think Chipotle will stay in the budget,\u201d Jack Hartung, the company's chief financial and chief administrative officer, said on the call. To wrap it all up, the burrito brand\u2019s success marks early good signs for chains worried about implementing the new workers\u2019 rights law. CEOs can serve themselves\u2014and their employees, too\u2014an extra helping of guac, as long as they really think creatively about how to cut costs and enhance productivity.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Chipotle says its employees can choose chicken once again.\n\nLast week, the chain asked its U.S. and Canadian employees to temporarily select another protein for their work meals to preserve the company's supply of chicken. The directive applied to both corporate staff and restaurant employees.\n\nNewport Beach, California-based Chipotle has more than 114,000 workers in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nBut Laurie Schalow, the Mexican chain\u2019s chief corporate affairs and food safety officer, said Thursday that the directive has been rescinded and employees can return to ordering chicken with their meals.\n\n\u201cWe are not experiencing outages of chicken in our restaurants,\u201d Schalow said in a statement. \u201cLast week we temporarily asked employees to select non-chicken options for their employee meals to maintain supply for our guests based on our strong sales, but employees are now free to select chicken in their meals as normal.\u201d\n\nChipotle\u2019s chicken al pastor, which is marinaded in morita peppers, ground achiote and pineapple, debuted in March 2023. It grew so popular that it soon made up 20% of all orders, Chipotle said. It was removed from the menu last August.\n\nDuring a conference call with investors Wednesday, Chipotle said its reintroduction of chicken al pastor in March as a limited-time offer drove strong traffic to its 3,371 U.S. stores and 66 international stores.\n\nChipotle said its revenue rose 14% to $2.7 billion in the January-March period while its same-store sales \u2013 or sales at locations open at least a year \u2013 were up 7%. Brian Niccol, Chipotle\u2019s chairman and CEO, said chicken al pastor was bringing in additional customers and encouraging regulars to come more often.\n\nChipotle Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said Thursday that the company plans to pull chicken al pastor off the menu again sometime in the third quarter of this year.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG released first-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, the company reported benefits from enhanced throughput and effective marketing initiatives like Braised Beef Barbacoa and Chicken Al Pastor, leading to strong sales and transaction growth.\r\n\r\nFollowing the earnings release, the company\u2019s shares rose 3.2% during the after-hours trading session on Apr 24.\n\nQ1 Earnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nIn the quarter under review, Chipotle reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $13.37, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.63. The bottom line increased 27.3% from $10.50 reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nQuarterly revenues of $2.7 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $2.68 billion by 1%. The top line rose 14.1% on a year-over-year basis on the back of strong comparable restaurant sales growth and new restaurant openings. In the reported quarter, Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants with 43 locations, including a Chipotlane and reported solid performances in terms of new restaurant sales, margins and returns.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Quote\n\nDigital sales contributed 36.5% to total food and beverage revenues.\r\n\r\nComparable restaurant sales rose 7% year over year compared with 8.4% growth reported in the previous quarter. Our estimate was pegged at 4.7%.\n\nCosts, Operating Highlights & Net Income\n\nDuring first-quarter 2024, food, beverage and packaging costs, as a percentage of revenues, came in at 28.8%, down 40 basis points year over year. The upside can be primarily attributed to menu price increases implemented since October 2023. This was partially offset by beef and produce inflation and a challenge in the protein mix resulting from the Braised Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative. We suggested the metric to be 29.2%.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter under discussion, the restaurant-level operating margin reached 27.5%, up from 25.6% a year ago. The uptick was driven by the benefit of sales leverage, partly mitigated by wage and ingredient inflation. We predicted the metric to be 25.5%.\r\n\r\nAdjusted net income in the reported quarter amounted to $369.3 million, up 26.6% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $308.2 million.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $727.4 million compared with $560.6 million as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, inventory totaled $37.9 million compared with $39.3 million as of Dec 31, 2023. Goodwill (as a percentage of total assets) reached 0.3% at the end of the first quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter, CMG repurchased $25 million worth of stock at an average price of $2,320. As of Mar 31, the company had approximately $399.1 million available for the buyback program.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, management expects comps growth in the mid to high-single-digit range.\r\n\r\nCMG anticipates to open 285-315 new restaurants in 2024. It suggests a 2024 tax rate in the range of 25-27%.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Key Picks\n\nChipotle currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail \u2013 Restaurants industry include:\r\n\r\nDine Brands Global, Inc.

        "content": "\u200b\u200b\u200bInflation is here to stay. While down from the historically high levels hit over the past year or so, inflation rates remain elevated and are wearing on the economy. U.S. business activity slowed to a four-month low this month, which has worried the Federal Reserve.\n\nIt was looking to cut interest rates at least three times this year, possibly as many as six times, but now it\u2019s not sure it will even do it once. Fed Chairman Jay Powell recently said he had no \u201cconfidence\u201d that inflation would head in the right direction, and there has even been talk of raising rates again to temper inflation\u2019s growth.\n\nInflation is insidious to consumers as it erodes their spending power. The same dollars buy less at the store. And it is all because of government spending with no politician exhibiting the will to rein it in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd yes, some businesses can thrive in a high-inflation environment. Their operations can profit because of the damage it causes to businesses and consumers. Below are two inflation stocks that should do well as high rates persist. There is also one stock that is most at risk.\n\nIamgold (IAG) gold stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs inflation makes a new move higher, the price of an ounce of gold sits near all-time record highs. It is unsurprising to see miners like Iamgold (NYSE:IAG) benefitting. The stock is up 45% year to date, and there is potential for shares to grow even more.\n\nAlthough costs are rising, profit margins should rise more, especially now that Iamgold had its first pour from Cote Gold. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) grew to $1,762 per ounce sold in 2023 from $1,582 per ounce sold the year before, an 11% increase, but Cote Gold should dramatically lower them.\n\nCote Gold is a new mine that Iamgold has been developing, and management believes it could be the third-largest gold mine in Canada. The miner says once the project achieves 90% of throughput, which it expects will happen by the end of 2024, it estimates its cash costs at that time will be in the range of approximately $700 to $800 per ounce sold and AISC of $1,100 to $1,200 per ounce sold. That will significantly lower Iamgold\u2019s overall AISC.\n\nWith stubborn inflation, gold will remain elevated, and miners like Iamgold will profit.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) Hands holding a smartphone with the Genuine Parts (GPC) logo displayed.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nInflation has made the cost of a new car prohibitively expensive. Used cars are no longer a bargain either. That\u2019s why aftermarket auto parts retailers like Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) shine in this environment.\n\nAccording to Cox Automotive, the cost of a new car in April is $47,244 on average. While that\u2019s down 2% from last year, it is significantly above their pre-pandemic level. Used car prices are also rising again in 2024, hitting $26,969. That\u2019s down 4% from last year, but they are closing in again on the record highs hit in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is why Genuine Parts is thriving. Car owners want to keep their existing cars on the road longer. The owner of the NAPA Auto Parts retail chain reported $5.8 billion in first-quarter revenue and beat expectations on the bottom line with earnings of $1.78 per share. That had management boosting its full-year profit guidance to $9.80 to $9.95 per share, a 1% increase from its previous outlook at the midpoint.\n\nThat might not seem like much, but Genuine Parts is a mature company that will not have wild swings. It also pays a dividend that yields 2.4% annually. It has paid a dividend ever since going public in 1948 and has raised the payout for 68 consecutive years.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurants are one industry most at risk from inflation because the cost of dining out becomes uneconomical compared to eating at home. Despite rampant inflation, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has been a standout performer over the past few years. Yet persistence in higher prices, which could also lead to a deferral in interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, could eventually take a toll.\n\nChipotle\u2019s armor has been its value proposition for a differentiated menu. The fast-casual chain offers consumers something different (and better) for their money, but when consumers feel pinched more for longer, they will start cutting back. That extra meal picked up through at a Chipotlane drive-thru window can easily be cut out.\n\nBecause the Mexican food chain\u2019s stock has quadrupled in value over the last five years, it has the furthest to fall. CMG stock is up 66% since its low point last October, but shares could quickly retrace that route.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in GPC stock.

        "title": "3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Chipotle (CMG)",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this Mexican food chain a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Chipotle is 40.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 19.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.7%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Chipotle is 29.5%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 11.4%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 28% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Chipotle have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.7% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Chipotle a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Chipotle is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Spicing Up the Market: Chipotle's Earnings Beat Heats Up Restaurant Stocks",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG reported earnings Wednesday after the market close and did not disappoint shareholders.\n\nChipotle had another stellar quarter of business activity, growing revenues 14.1% YoY, increasing margins, and opening 47 new restaurants with 43 including a Chipotlane, a drive through option.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is an innovator in the restaurant space, commercializing the fast-casual concept and leading the way for the industry. Shareholders have benefitted tremendously from Chipotle\u2019s success as the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 19.7%, well above the broad market and industry.\n\nWith analyst beating earnings, and a top Zacks Rank Chipotle Mexican Grill makes for a worthy consideration in any investor\u2019s portfolio. Additionally, several other up and coming restaurant stocks offer huge opportunity, and the sector as a whole has shown relative strength during the recent market selloff.\n\nHere we will cover Chipotle\u2019s earnings and share two other top ranked restaurant stock to dive into. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Results\n\nChipotle reported a strong first quarter with revenue up 14.1% to $2.7 billion. Comparable restaurant sales grew 7%, driven by higher transactions and menu price increases. Profits were also strong, with adjusted earnings per share up 27.3% to $13.37.\n\nEarnings beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 14.5% and sales by 1.2%.\n\nThe company is optimistic about the future, citing successful marketing initiatives and a focus on throughput. They are expecting full-year comparable restaurant sales growth in the mid to high-single digits and plan to open 285 to 315 new restaurants.\n\nMargins saw notable expansion as well, with operating margin rising from 15.5% to 16.3% from last quarter.\n\nIs Chipotle a Buy?\n\nAs of today, Chipotle shows continued growth on both the top and bottom line as it cements its leadership in the space. It boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and forecasts EPS to grow 22% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nAdditionally, as noted, CMG stock has been displaying relative strength against the broad market, indicating a preference for the stock from institutional investors.\n\nOther High-Flying Restaurant Stocks\n\nThe sector has been performing quite well broadly, and a handful of new restaurant stocks have been putting up huge rallies.\n\nTwo stocks which have gone public more recently and are posting impressive growth are Wingstop WING and CAVA Group CAVA.\n\nWhile Wingstop is a more traditional chicken wing take-out and eat it restaurant, CAVA Group has been following the Chipotle model very closely. Cava restaurants have similar industrial design, restaurant layout and pricing to the incumbent Chipotle and showing that the setup works.\n\nStory continues\n\nCAVA Group is expecting sales to grow 19% annually this year and next and is also forecasting net positive earnings results for the first time in the coming quarter.\n\nBoth Cava and Wingstop have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating and are up significantly more YTD in terms of stock price.\n\nWingstop is forming an especially compelling technical trade setup. Over the last two months, the price action on WING stock has been building out a bull flag. If the stock can trade above the $375 level, it would signal a technical breakout. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBottom Line\n\nGeneral wisdom usually says that restaurants are a poor business, however the stocks shared here would say otherwise. Chipotle has been one of the top performers in the market over the last decade, and both Cava and Wingstop are showing huge potential with near-term bullish catalysts.\n\nIt is also worth noting that amid the worst selloff in nearly six months, these restaurant stocks are showing relative strength against the broader market. Stocks that show strength while the market is down are usually the ones that lead during the next bull run.\n\nFor investors looking to diversify into restaurant stocks, Chipotle, Wingstop and Cava all make for worthwhile considerations.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let's take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, both Yum China Holdings and Chipotle Mexican Grill are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nYUMC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.67, while CMG has a forward P/E of 54.71. We also note that YUMC has a PEG ratio of 1.45. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. CMG currently has a PEG ratio of 2.48.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for YUMC is its P/B ratio of 2.26. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CMG has a P/B of 26.23.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help YUMC earn a Value grade of B, while CMG has been given a Value grade of F.\n\nBoth YUMC and CMG are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that YUMC is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Chipotle (CMG) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).\n\nChipotle currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 31 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 31 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 61.3% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Chipotle here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Chipotle, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs CMG a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Chipotle, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.7% over the past month to $53.49.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Chipotle. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Chipotle may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. is telling its employees not to include chicken in their own meals, as surging customer demand has crimped supply.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMalaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City Biden\u2019s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows Zuckerberg Asks for Patience as Meta\u2019s AI Push Spooks Investors How to Get a Meeting With the UAE\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Man Meta\u2019s Miss Sparks Fears in Tech With More Earnings Ahead\n\nThe reintroduction of chicken al pastor has been a huge success, creating challenges, the company told US employees in an email last week.\n\n\u201cDue to its sustained strong sales we need your help to keep up with our guests\u2019 demand for this popular protein option,\u201d according to the message from Chief Restaurant Officer Scott Boatwright, which was viewed by Bloomberg News.\n\nStore managers were told not to order their free or discounted employee meals with chicken or chicken al pastor, and to ask their team members to do the same. The email also instructed white-collar staff at Chipotle offices that they \u201cshould not\u201d order chicken for themselves and said the popular option wouldn\u2019t be included in their free Monday lunches.\n\nThe message, bearing the subject line \u201cLet\u2019s Conserve Our Fan-Favorite Chicken,\u201d said the changes were effective immediately and would last until further notice. The goal is to \u201cpreserve our supply of Adobo Chicken for our guests,\u201d it read.\n\nResolution Pending\n\nIn an emailed statement, Chipotle said the message was a request and not a mandate.\n\n\u201cDue to the high demand for chicken in our restaurants and sustained success of our limited-time offer chicken al pastor, we temporarily asked all of our employees at corporate and in-restaurants to select another protein option for their meals to preserve our supply,\u201d Chief Corporate Affairs and Food Safety Officer Laurie Schalow said. \u201cWe expect this situation to be resolved within a week.\u201d\n\nChipotle\u2019s chicken directive has roiled some workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disrespectful, just on a personal level,\u201d said Harper McNamara, an employee in Michigan at the company\u2019s only unionized US store.\n\nManagers have been threatening to discipline workers who get chicken during their lunch breaks, and in some cases have thrown out chicken meals made for them, employees there said. In some cases it\u2019s the only meat workers can eat, for reasons including health and religion, they said.\n\nChipotle is putting managers in an unfair position by requiring them to enforce the new policy, said Atulya Dora-Laskey, who like McNamara is a member of the bargaining committee at the Lansing, Michigan, store. The abrupt chicken change, even if temporary, illustrates the need for a union contract that secures workers\u2019 benefits, she said.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt really has Chipotle employees wondering, if it\u2019s chicken today, is it going to be, \u2018Oh, we have a drinks shortage, you can\u2019t get drinks\u2019 tomorrow?\u201d Dora-Laskey said.\n\nWorkers at the store voted to unionize with the Teamsters in August 2022, but haven\u2019t yet reached a collective bargaining agreement with the company. The two sides remain far apart on some issues, including minimum staffing for the store, they said.\n\nMarketing Success\n\nThe company highlighted chicken al pastor Wednesday as one of its \u201csuccessful marketing initiatives,\u201d along with braised beef barbacoa, that helped fuel a 7% first quarter increase in comparable restaurant sales over last year.\n\nRead More: Chipotle Raises Full-Year Outlook on Strong Burrito Demand\n\n\u201cObviously, we love what chicken al pastor does for us,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol said on the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nIn last week\u2019s email, Boatwright suggested employees \u201csee this as an opportunity to enjoy our other real, delicious protein options, such as steak or carnitas.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Daniela Sirtori.\n\n(Updates with worker comment in 12th paragraph.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.'s (NYSE:CMG) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 27% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Chipotle Mexican Grill's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Chipotle Mexican Grill is:\n\n40% = US$1.2b \u00f7 US$3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.40 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's Earnings Growth And 40% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Chipotle Mexican Grill has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 17% which is quite remarkable. So, the substantial 36% net income growth seen by Chipotle Mexican Grill over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Chipotle Mexican Grill's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 21% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Chipotle Mexican Grill is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Chipotle Mexican Grill Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nGiven that Chipotle Mexican Grill doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Chipotle Mexican Grill's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

        "title": "One Member of Congress Is Going Against the Grain and Selling This Skyrocketing Stock-Split Stock",
        "content": "Over the three previous weeks, Wall Street's major stock indexes have sent a stern reminder to investors that equities don't move up in a straight line. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and innovation-powered Nasdaq Composite have all retraced by at least 5% from their respective record-closing highs.\n\nWhen volatility and uncertainty rear their proverbial heads, both professional and everyday investors have a tendency to seek the safety of time-tested outperformers. While the \"FAANG stocks\" have been popular for more than a decade, it's stocks enacting splits that investors -- including members of Congress -- have really flocked to in recent years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors have gravitated to stock-split stocks\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. I say \"cosmetically,\" because stock splits have no effect on a company's underlying market cap or its operations.\n\nA forward-stock split is used by public companies to make their shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors. This can be especially useful for investors who don't have access to fractional-share purchases. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split increases a company's nominal share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange.\n\nThough there have been instances in the past where companies enacting a reverse-stock split have gone on to make their shareholders richer (e.g., Booking Holdings), most investors are focused on forward splits. Companies whose share price is rocketing higher are typically out-innovating and out-executing their competition. In other words, they're just the type of businesses we'd expect to increase in value over time.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, nearly a half-dozen prominent companies have completed a forward split, including Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, and even Walmart, which occurred earlier this year.\n\nGenerally, when an outperforming company announces that it'll be joining this elite group of stock-split stocks, investors pile in. But that hasn't been the case for one of Congress' most-active traders when it comes to a skyrocketing stock-split stock.\n\nThis history-making stock-split stock is being sold by one of Congress' most-active traders\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) at $22 per share in January 2006, fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) has been a sizzling investment. With shares ending the session on April 23 at $2,915, it means Chipotle has delivered a 13,150% aggregate return since its IPO.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut one thing Chipotle hasn't done in its 18 years as a public company is conduct a stock split. On March 19, the company's board of directors announced a 50-for-1 forward split. The magnitude of this split makes its one of the largest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Assuming shareholders vote in favor of this split at the company's annual meeting in June, Chipotle will begin trading at closer to $60 per share on June 26.\n\nDespite this history-making stock split, House Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), the second most-active trader in Congress last year -- McCaul completed 1,826 trades in 2023, based on data from Unusual Whales -- has been a seller of Chipotle stock.\n\nThanks to the STOCK Act, which was signed into law in 2012, members of Congress, along with their spouses and children, are required to report trades of $1,000 or larger no later than 45 days after they're completed. Based on these periodic transaction reports, we can see that after previous purchases of Chipotle stock by McCaul in late July 2023 and early November 2023, he's sold shares on four separate occasions this year, ranging from $2,326 per share to $2,598 per share.\n\nThough this could very well be simple profit-taking by an extremely active trader on Capitol Hill, Wall Street's newest stock-split stock has drawbacks, too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSpilling the beans: Chipotle has clear-cut competitive advantages, but it's not attractively valued\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill has built its success on the belief that consumers will pay more for high-quality food. The company sources its vegetables locally, when possible, uses responsibly raised meats that are free of routine-use antibiotics, and prepares its food fresh daily without the need for freezers. Taking these extra steps has made it easier for the company to pass along higher prices to its customers.\n\nAnother reason for Chipotle's success is its reasonably small menu. Keeping the number of food offerings relatively small makes it easier for the company's employees to prepare food and keeps the line moving. To add, introducing new items can have a bigger impact when the number of offerings is limited.\n\nInnovation has also played a role for Chipotle -- and I'm not just talking about new food items. The introduction of dedicated mobile ordering lanes, known as \"Chipotlanes,\" has further expedited the ordering process and added a new revenue stream for the company.\n\nDespite this trio of catalysts, two headwinds have the potential to stymie Chipotle's sizzling stock, or perhaps send shares lower.\n\nThe first concern is a stubbornly high inflation rate. Though Chipotle's most-loyal customers have demonstrated a willingness to pay more for its food, rising costs in other areas of the economy, such as housing, could begin squeezing the wallets of the company's casual customer. If select predictive indicators and money-based metrics are correct, not even Chipotle would be immune to a U.S. recession.\n\nThe other issue for Chipotle is its aggressive valuation. While its clear-cut competitive advantages do merit a premium, shares of the company are currently trading at a nosebleed multiple of 45 times forward-year earnings. There's only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of a restaurant chain that offers an organic growth rate from its existing stores of around 8% to 10%. The company's pricey stock, which seemingly leaves little room for upside in the coming quarters, could be the catalyst that's enticing Rep. McCaul to head for the exit.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) came out with quarterly earnings of $13.37 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.63 per share. This compares to earnings of $10.50 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14.96%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this Mexican food chain would post earnings of $9.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $10.36, delivering a surprise of 6.47%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nChipotle , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, posted revenues of $2.7 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.01%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.37 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nChipotle shares have added about 27.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Chipotle?\n\nWhile Chipotle has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Chipotle: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $15.05 on $2.87 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $53.49 on $11.25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Restaurants is currently in the bottom 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. (STKS), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -80%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe ONE Group Hospitality, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $85.97 million, up 4.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Chipotle rang up another bowl of positive earnings on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nFor its first quarter, revenue grew 14.1% to $2.7 billion, with same-store sales jumping by 7%, higher than estimates of 5.13%. The company also beat expectations on the bottom line, with adjusted earnings per share coming in at $13.37, compared to estimates of $11.66.\n\nShares rose 3% in after market trading.\n\nLimited-time offers like Braised Beef Barbacoa and Chicken al Pastor, which are priced at a premium, boosted results against a difficult macro consumer backdrop. The chain saw a 5.4% increase in foot traffic, but the average check was only up 1.6%, lower than the 2.0% expected.\n\nCEO Brian Niccol called the quarter \"outstanding,\" with improvement in store throughput and successful marketing initiatives. The results provides \"confidence that we can achieve our long-term target of more than doubling our business in North America and expanding internationally,\" he said.\n\nIn Q1, Chipotle opened 47 new restaurants, with 43 locations having its drive-thru feature Chipotlane. This year, it expects to open 285 to 315 new locations, with more than 80% of them having the drive-thru concept. Long term, it plans to operate 7,000 restaurants in North America (there are currently 3,500).\n\nFor 2024, the company expects sales growth of mid to high-single digits, up from the previous guidance of mid-single digit growth.\n\nPrior to the results, Lauren Silberman of Deutsche Bank wrote in a client note that \"Chipotle has been among the best-performing restaurant stocks.\"\n\nChipotle's operating margin expanded to 16.3%, up from 15.5% compared to a year ago, while restaurant level margins also jumped slightly, from 25.6% to 27.5%.\n\nIn its earnings call, Wall Street will be listening for updates regarding its automation efforts, such as its guacamole prep robot, Autocado. CEO Brian Niccol told Yahoo Finance that the machine is close to deployment.\n\n\"We're already on like our third or fourth prototype [of Autocado], and now we're like, OK, this is ready to go into a restaurant. I'm sure when we put it in the restaurant, we'll learn something that might cause us to iterate one more time.\"\n\nInvestors will also wait to hear how California's FAST Act, which increased fast food wages to $20 per hour, impacted its business in the state. Analysts agreed that Chipotle is among the companies that have the brand power and fanbase to adjust to the change.\n\n\"I think brands who provide a lot of value and have good traffic are best positioned,\" said Peter Saleh of BTIG, who pointed out that Chipotle's chicken bowl averages $9 across the country, compared to $12 to $13 for many burger meals.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"They've built quite a bit of momentum in their business with respect to traffic,\" Citi analyst Jon Tower told Yahoo Finance.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nIn a client note written prior to the results, Sharon Zackfia of William Blair said about 14% of Chipotle's total locations are in the Golden State, and she suspects Chipotle raised prices about 7% in the state to cover incremental labor cost pressure.\n\nHere's what Chipotle reported in Q1, compared to what Wall Street expected, according to Bloomberg estimates:\n\nRevenue: $2.70 billion versus$2.67 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $13.37 versus $11.66 Same-store sales growth: 7% versus 5.13% Transactions growth: 5.4% versus 3.03% Average check growth: 1.6% versus 2.00%\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Its shares breached $3,000 mark for the first time after it approved a 50-for-1 stock split last month.\n\nChipotle has seen an increase in foot traffic at its stores thanks in part to its higher-income customer base that is relatively less impacted in the face of sticky inflation.\n\nData from Placer.ai showed that monthly visits to Chipotle during the months of January, February and March had outpaced the wider fast-casual segment.

        "content": "Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) Surprises With Q1 Sales\n\nMexican fast-food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) reported Q1 CY2024 results topping analysts' expectations , with revenue down 14.1% year on year to $2.70 billion. It made a non-GAAP profit of $13.37 per share, improving from its profit of $10.50 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Chipotle? Find out in our full research report.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $2.70 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.67 billion (1.2% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $13.37 vs analyst estimates of $11.68 (14.5% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 41.7%, up from 41% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $436.5 million, up from $93.53 million in the previous quarter Same-Store Sales were up 7% year on year Full year guidance for \"comparable restaurant sales growth in the mid to high-single digit range\" (raised from previous guide of mid-single digit, analyst estimates are for up 5.9% year on year) Store Locations: 3,479 at quarter end, increasing by 255 over the last 12 months Market Capitalization: $80.07 billion\n\n\"We had another outstanding quarter driven by our improvement in throughput and successful marketing initiatives, including Braised Beef Barbacoa and Chicken Al Pastor, which drove strong sales and transactions. The results we are seeing from our focus on developing exceptional people, preparing delicious food and fast throughput gives me confidence that we can achieve our long-term target of more than doubling our business in North America and expanding internationally,\" said Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, Chipotle.\n\nBorn from a desire to offer quick meals with fresh, flavorful ingredients, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a fast-food chain known for its healthy, Mexican-inspired cuisine and customizable dishes.\n\nModern Fast Food\n\nModern fast food is a relatively newer category representing a middle ground between traditional fast food and sit-down restaurants. These establishments feature an expanded menu selection priced above traditional fast food options, often incorporating fresher and cleaner ingredients to serve customers prioritizing quality. These eateries are capitalizing on the perception that your drive-through burger and fries joint is detrimental to your health because of inferior ingredients.\n\nSales Growth\n\nChipotle is one of the most widely recognized restaurant chains in the world and benefits from brand equity, giving it customer loyalty and more influence over purchasing decisions.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 15.2% over the last five years was impressive as it added more dining locations and increased sales at existing, established restaurants.\n\nStory continues Chipotle Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Chipotle reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 14.1%, and its $2.70 billion in revenue exceeded Wall Street's estimates by 1.2%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 13.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nSame-store sales growth is a key performance indicator used to measure organic growth and demand for restaurants.\n\nChipotle's demand within its existing restaurants has generally risen over the last two years but lagged behind the broader sector. On average, the company's same-store sales have grown by 7.8% year on year. With positive same-store sales growth amid an increasing number of restaurants, Chipotle is reaching more diners and growing sales. Chipotle Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nIn the latest quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 7% year on year. This growth was a deceleration from the 10.9% year-on-year increase it posted 12 months ago, showing the business is still performing well but lost a bit of steam.\n\nKey Takeaways from Chipotle's Q1 Results\n\nWe liked that Chipotle beat same store sales, revenue, gross margin, and EPS expectations. Full year guidance for comparable store sales was raised from mid-single digit year on year percentage increase to mid to high-single digit percentage increase. Zooming out, we think this was a great quarter that shareholders will appreciate. The stock is up 4.1% after reporting and currently trades at $3,045 per share.\n\nChipotle may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "CHIPOTLE ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2024 RESULTS",
        "content": "COMPARABLE SALES INCREASE 7% DRIVEN BY OVER 5% TRANSACTION GROWTH AS MARGINS EXPAND\n\nNEWPORT BEACH, Calif., April 24, 2024/PRNewswire/ -- Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March\u00a031, 2024.\n\nFirst quarter highlights, year over year:\n\nTotal revenue increased 14.1% to $2.7 billion\n\nComparable restaurant sales increased 7.0%\n\nOperating margin was 16.3%, an increase from 15.5%\n\nRestaurant level operating margin was 27.5%1, an increase of 190 basis points\n\nDiluted earnings per share was $13.01, a 23.9% increase from $10.50. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excluded a $0.36 after-tax impact from an increase in legal reserves, was $13.371, a 27.3% increase from $10.501.\n\nOpened 47 new restaurants with 43 locations including a Chipotlane\n\n\"We had another outstanding quarter driven by our improvement in throughput and successful marketing initiatives, including Braised Beef\u00a0Barbacoa and Chicken Al Pastor, which drove strong sales and transactions. The results we are seeing from our focus on developing exceptional people, preparing delicious food and fast throughput gives me confidence that we can achieve our long-term target of more than doubling our business in North America and expanding internationally,\" said Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, Chipotle.\n\nResults for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2024:\n\nTotal revenue in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, an increase of 14.1% compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase in total revenue was driven by new restaurant openings and a 7.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales due to higher transactions of 5.4% and a 1.6% increase in average check. Digital sales represented 36.5% of total food and beverage revenue.\n\nWe opened 47 new restaurants during the first quarter with 43 locations including a Chipotlane. These formats continue to perform well and are helping enhance guest access and convenience, as well as increase new restaurant sales, margins, and returns.\n\nFood, beverage and packaging costs in the first quarter were 28.8% of total revenue, a decrease of about 40 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to menu price increases from October 2023, partially offset by inflation across several ingredient costs, primarily beef and produce, and a protein mix headwind from the successful Braised Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative.\n\nRestaurant level operating margin in the first quarter was 27.5%1 compared to 25.6% in the first quarter of 2023. The improvement was primarily driven by the benefit of sales leverage, partially offset by wage and ingredient inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter were $204.6 million on a GAAP basis, or $191.4 million1 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding a $13.3 million increase in legal reserves. GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for the first quarter also include $125.8 million of underlying general and administrative expenses, $34.3 million of non-cash stock compensation, $21.0 million for our biennial All Managers Conference held in the first quarter of 2024, and $9.9 million of payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises and higher performance-based accruals.\n\nThe effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 22.0% compared to 22.5% in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from option exercises and equity vesting.\n\nNet income for the first quarter was $359.3 million, or $13.01 per diluted share, compared to $291.6 million, or $10.50 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, excluding the $0.36 after-tax impact from an increase in legal reserves, adjusted net income was $369.3 million1 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $13.371.\n\nDuring the first quarter we repurchased $25.0 million of stock at an average price per share of $2,320. Due to the timing of our announcement of a 50 for 1 stock split, we were unable to repurchase our shares for most of the quarter.\u00a0 We plan to resume opportunistically repurchasing our shares when the trading window opens on April 26, 2024. As of March\u00a031, 2024, $399.1 million remained available under share repurchase authorizations from our Board of Directors. The repurchase authorization may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.\n\nMore information will be available in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which will be filed with the SEC by the end of April.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, management is anticipating the following:\n\nFull year comparable restaurant sales growth in the mid to high-single digit range\n\n285 to 315 new restaurant openings with over 80% having a Chipotlane\n\nAn estimated underlying effective full year tax rate between 25% and 27% before discrete items\n\nDefinitions\n\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this release:\n\nComparable restaurant sales, or sales comps, and comparable restaurant transactions, represent the change in period-over-period total revenue or transactions for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months.\n\nAverage restaurant sales refer to the average trailing 12-month food and beverage revenue for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months.\n\nRestaurant level operating margin represents total revenue less direct restaurant operating costs, expressed as a percent of total revenue.\n\nDigital sales represent food and beverage revenue generated through the Chipotle website, Chipotle app or third-party delivery aggregators. Digital sales include revenue deferrals associated with Chipotle Rewards.\n\nConference Call Details\n\nChipotle will host a conference call on Wednesday, April\u00a024, 2024, at 4:30 PM Eastern time to discuss first quarter 2024 financial results as well as provide a business update for the second quarter 2024.\n\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 1-888-317-6003, or for international callers by dialing 1-412-317-6061, and use code: 7358132.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented in the text above to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAdjusted net income is net income excluding expenses related to certain legal proceedings. Adjusted general and administrative expense is general and administrative expense excluding expenses related to certain legal proceedings. The adjusted effective income tax rate is the effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the after tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments. Restaurant Level Operating Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is equal to the revenues generated by our restaurants less their direct operating costs which consist of food, beverage and packaging, labor, occupancy and other operating costs. This performance measure primarily includes the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other costs that are essential to conduct our business. Management uses restaurant level operating margin as a measure of restaurant performance. Management believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP measures in order to facilitate meaningful evaluation of our operating performance across periods. These adjustments are intended to provide greater transparency of underlying performance and to allow investors to evaluate our business on the same basis as our management, which uses these non-GAAP measures in evaluating the company's performance. Our adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted effective income tax rate and restaurant level operating margin measures may not be comparable to other companies' adjusted measures. These adjustments are not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial performance would have been during the periods presented and should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

        "title": "50% of Billionaire Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Portfolio Is in These 3 Companies -- and They're Not Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Bill Ackman is one of the most well-known billionaire investors and is the head of the Pershing Square hedge fund. However, unlike many of his billionaire peers in the industry, Ackman is a value investor at heart and primarily invests in easy-to-understand businesses at a perceived discount, as opposed to trying to put his money in the next big thing.\n\nAccording to Pershing's latest U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, there are only seven different stocks in the portfolio, and only one of them is a technology stock. In fact, Ackman's three largest non-tech positions make up about 50% of the portfolio's entire market value. Here's what they are and why Ackman might be so confident in them.\n\n1. Chipotle\n\nPershing Square's largest non-technology investment is Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). The hedge fund owns about $1.9 billion worth of the fast-casual chain's stock, and it has been a big winner for Ackman and his team. Pershing paid about $436 per share for its Chipotle stock. By the end of 2023, it had a gain of about 425%.\n\nChipotle, which recently announced a 50-to-1 stock split, is trading near all-time highs, and it isn't hard to see why. Not only is Chipotle a highly profitable business with a 12.5% net margin (high for a restaurant operator), but it is still growing fast, with annualized revenue growth of more than 18% over the past three years.\n\nDespite its stellar performance, there could be plenty of room to grow. Chipotle currently operates about 3,400 restaurants (mostly in the United States) and plans to double the U.S. store count over time. The company will also focus on international expansion. It sees potential for a total of 10,000 locations, which seem rather reasonable given that it would still have roughly one-fourth of the stores of McDonald's(NYSE: MCD).\n\n2. Restaurant Brands International\n\nRestaurant Brands International(NYSE: QSR) is the parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes, and Firehouse Subs. It accounts for 17.6% of Pershing Square's stock portfolio, and the $1.8 billion investment represents a 7.4% stake in the restaurant operator.\n\nThe company's business model mainly consists of selling franchising rights to owner/operators, and there are more than 30,000 franchised locations among its four brands. It has a highly profitable business model, with a net margin of nearly 25%, and has grown its revenue at a 12.4% annualized rate over the past three years. It's also a solid dividend stock, with a 3.1% yield at the current share price. With the company investing heavily in reinvigorating the Burger King brand, there could be significant growth potential in the years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Hilton\n\nHotel operator Hilton (NYSE: HLT) makes up about 16.2% of Pershing Square's portfolio and is the newest of the three positions on the list. Ackman has been investing in Hilton since late 2018 (the other two were started in 2016 and 2014, respectively), and the stock has roughly doubled since that time.\n\nNot only has Hilton's business performed well, with revenue up 80% over the past two years, but the company continues to expand its global footprint and reinvest in its properties. Its iconic brand and scale give it a big competitive advantage, and with travel demand having been surprisingly resilient despite inflation, now could be a good time to add some exposure to your portfolio.\n\nShould you take a closer look?\n\nTo be sure, I'd never suggest buying a particular stock just because a billionaire did. But these are three highly profitable and well-run businesses with significant growth potential in the years to come. If you're looking for some non-tech exposure in your portfolio, they could be worth a closer look.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Chipotle, Check Out This Up-and-Coming Fast Casual Restaurant Entrant",
        "content": "In the bustling fast-casual dining sector, Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) has set a strong benchmark for measuring success and innovation. Meanwhile, Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) continues to carve out a niche and challenge established norms with its dynamic and health-oriented approach.\n\nLet's look deeper into Cava's business model, growth strategies, and potential as a smart long-term investment by putting it head-to-head against the industry leader.\n\nCava's strategic menu design appeals to health-conscious diners\n\nCava's menu, infused with vibrant Mediterranean flavors, appears meticulously crafted to match the modern diner's desire for delicious and nutritious options. With protein-rich grains and a variety of fresh dips and abundant vegetable choices, the chain's offerings aim to delight the taste buds while simplifying healthy eating habits.\n\nThat strategic approach to menu diversification continues to play a pivotal role in Cava's financial success, as evidenced by an impressive annual revenue surge to $717.1 million in 2023, representing a remarkable 59.8% increase over the previous year. By focusing on health-conscious, customizable meals, the company is directly responding to the growing consumer demand for dietary awareness and flexibility in meal options. While Chipotle also makes the customer king with customization, its menu flexibility falls short of Cava's options.\n\nCava's substantial revenue growth demonstrates its effective market penetration and underscores its operational excellence, indicating a scalable and replicable business model. These factors also signal a resilient enterprise ready to thrive in diverse markets. That positions Cava stock as a potentially lucrative long-term opportunity, one you could hold for at least three to five years to grow your investment alongside the company.\n\nThere's also some obvious room for growth when Cava goes head-to-head with Chipotle. Last year's USA Today Readers' Choice Awards gave the fast-casual Mexican chain a top-three slot. Cava placed 7th in the same category of best restaurants for quick, healthy food. Just making the top 10 is a big win, though.\n\nHow Cava's digital innovations enhance customer experience\n\nLike Chipotle, Cava embraces technology to improve how customers interact with its brand. In 2023, digital sales accounted for 36% of its total revenue, thanks to online ordering and a mobile app. The company's CEO seeks to create a \"multi-channel business,\" focusing on success capturing both walk-ins and online orders.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsing digital sales isn't just about keeping up with trends; it shows Cava's ability to adapt to what customers want and stay competitive. These moves show the chain has what it takes to make more money and stand out in the fast-casual dining world. Both Cava and Chipotle use tech to make things better for customers, and Cava's fully integrated digital system gives it an extra boost. Tech helps Cava save money, serve customers better, and stay ahead of the game.\n\nFinancial insights from Cava's revenue surge and market position\n\nIn 2023, Cava expanded its presence by 30%, adding 72 new locations and aiming for over 1,000 stores by 2032. Alongside this growth in locations, average unit volume (AUV) increased from $2.4 million to $2.6 million. This rise in AUV indicates higher average sales per location, showing that the company's strategies are continuing to improve performance at individual restaurants.\n\nThis growth in AUV is significant for Cava's financial performance and future prospects. It highlights the chain's ability to drive sales and revenue growth through effective strategy and operational execution. Cava's aggressive expansion and operational efficiency showcase its strength in the market, further evidenced by its stellar year-over-year performance.\n\nCava's market niche compared to Chipotle\n\nCava's Mediterranean-inspired menu distinguishes it from Chipotle's Mexican-inspired offerings, allowing Cava to tap into a niche market segment and sidestep the giant. Cava also enjoys an advantage over Chipotle's more conventional menu selections. This strategic differentiation minimizes direct competition with Chipotle, potentially expanding Cava's market share.\n\nCava's focused culinary approach also shields it from some of the intense competitive pressures faced by larger chains. By innovating within the realm of Mediterranean cuisine, Cava creates a buffer against economic fluctuations and shifts in consumer preferences, enhancing its market stability over the long term.\n\nAs it scales, Cava faces the challenge of maintaining its distinctive brand identity and high standards of quality and service. The fast-casual market remains notoriously competitive. Cava must innovate continuously in its menu offerings as well as its marketing strategies and customer engagement techniques to stay ahead in the evolving landscape of dining preferences.\n\nIs investing in Cava a worthy choice?\n\nInvesting in Cava presents a promising opportunity for portfolio diversification. With its solid financial foundation, strategic plans, and unique niche, Cava appears ready for substantial growth. The brand's proactive expansion strategy, along with its emphasis on digital integration and adaptability to emerging trends, make it an enticing investment choice with significant long-term potential.\n\nWhile investors probably won't forget Chipotle, especially not with a market cap 10 times larger than that of the newcomer, there's ample room for multiple contenders in the fast-casual market, and plenty of compelling reasons to consider investing in both.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $487,211!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because Chipotle is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CMG in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $11.77 per share for CMG, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.57 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CMG, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.69% heading into earnings season.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\n\nGiven that CMG has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Chipotle, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Chipotle Earnings: What To Look For From CMG\n\nMexican fast-food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow afternoon. Here's what you need to know.\n\nLast quarter Chipotle reported revenues of $2.52 billion, up 15.4% year on year, beating analyst revenue expectations by 1.1%. It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' gross margin estimates and a decent beat of analysts' revenue estimates.\n\nIs Chipotle buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Chipotle's revenue to grow 12.7% year on year to $2.67 billion, slowing down from the 17.2% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $11.65 per share. Chipotle Total Revenue\n\nMajority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last thirty days, suggesting they are expecting the business to stay the course heading into the earnings. The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates five times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Chipotle's peers in the restaurants segment, some of them have already reported Q1 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. Darden delivered top-line growth of 6.8% year on year, missing analyst estimates by 1.7% and Kura Sushi reported revenues up 30.4% year on year, exceeding estimates by 1.1%. Darden traded down 5.5% on the results, and Kura Sushi was up 5.7%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Darden's results here and Kura Sushi's results here.\n\nInflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and while some of the restaurants stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share price declining 3.6% over the last month. Chipotle is down 0.6% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with with analyst price target of $2,947.4, compared to share price of $2,887.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

        "title": "Domino's Pizza (DPZ) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Domino's Pizza (DPZ) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis pizza chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.3%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $1.08 billion, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.65% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Domino's Pizza?\n\nFor Domino's Pizza, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.59%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Domino's Pizza will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Domino's Pizza would post earnings of $4.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.48, delivering a surprise of +2.52%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nDomino's Pizza doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is soon expected to post earnings of $11.56 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.67 billion, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Chipotle has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.86%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Chipotle will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is There Reason for Alarm as Cava Group Investors Sell?",
        "content": "Cava Group Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) operates Mediterranean-style fast-casual restaurants primarily in the East Coast and Southern regions of the United States. They operate over 300 locations under two brand names, CAVA and Zoe's Kitchen, which it acquired in 2018. Is There Reason for Alarm as Cava Group Investors Sell?\n\nSource: 2023 annual investor presentation\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with T.\n\nThe stock performance recently has been outstanding, rising almost 50% so far this year. Compared to small caps and the restaurant industry being relatively flat for the year, Cava Group has been a darling in an underperforming sector. Is There Reason for Alarm as Cava Group Investors Sell?\n\nCAVA Data by GuruFocus\n\nThis all sounds wonderfulexcept some investors have sold a significant amount of their stake in the company over the past few months. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly warrants a closer look.\n\nWho is jumping ship?\n\nTwo major investors are responsible for almost all of the selling.\n\nRon Shaich is chairman of the board of directors for Cava Group and sold 1.50 million shares in March. This dropped his share count from 11.60 million to just over 10.10 million (13% drop in ownership). Artal International S.C.A. is an investment firm based in Luxembourg. It has sold 5.50 million shares so far in 2024. This dropped its share count from 32 million to 26.50 million (17% drop in ownership). Even after the selling, Artal owns over 20% of CAVA Group and has two members on the board of directors. Is There Reason for Alarm as Cava Group Investors Sell?\n\nSource: Insider page on GuruFocus\n\nThat is a lot of shares being sold. Regardless, it is important to note this type of selling is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nLarge investors might sell their positions to make a large purchase or rebalance their investment portfolio rather than because of a pessimistic outlook on the company. It should also be noted that Cava Group first started trading less than a year ago and this could be one of the first opportunities for investors to divest some of their shares.\n\nIs there reason for alarm?\n\nEven though these investors still hold a large position in CAVA Group, it is important to do our due diligence to make sure it is still a good investment.\n\nCAVA Group had its initial public offering in June 2023, which means doing historical comparisons is not going to be a viable way to value the stock. Instead, we need to look at the current valuation as well as potential growth in the future.\n\nKey Statistics (as of: 4/12/2024) CAVA Group Restaurant Industry Median P/E 1,063 23.5 P/B 12.7 2.8 Net Margin 1.2 2.4 ROE 11.4 8.3 Debt/Equity 0.6 0.94\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nThe return on equity and debt-equity numbers look pretty good compared to peers, but the valuation ratios really jump out as a red flag. A price-earnings ratio of just over 1,000 is astronomical. Does this mean Cava Group is overvalued?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is not that simple. The company not only went public in 2023, but also recorded its first profit in the same year. With earnings per share of just 6 cents and a recent IPO, it should not be too surprising to get some wonky valuation numbers.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nIt is always important to look at the future prospects of a company. CAVA Group is looking to grow fast. At the end of 2023, it had over 300 restaurants, but is looking to grow its number of locations by at least 15% per year until it reaches over 1,000 in 2032. That is significant growth, and the company has the room to do it.\n\nCAVA Group's largest competitor is Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG), which operates over 3,000 restaurants across the United States. It has a huge part of the market share and Cava Group has an opportunity to chip away to grow the company.\n\nAnother place that Cava Group really stands out is same-restaurant sales growth. This measures the sales growth in existing restaurants and thus excludes sales growth derived from opening new locations.\n\nSame-Restaurant Sales Growth Rate 2023 2022 CAVA Group 17.9 14.2 Chipotle Mexican Grill 7.9 8.0 Industry Average 1.7 5.9\n\nSource: Annual reports, Industry average from Restaurant Business\n\nCava Group is way ahead of Chipotle as well as the overall industry. Even with the industry growth slowing in 2023, the company's same-restaurant sales growth is accelerating.\n\nOne can see the restaurant's two-pronged approach to growth. On one side, it will be opening new restaurants at a very fast pace over the next decade. On the other side, it has double-digit revenue growth in its existing stores. Combined, this strategy led to 30% growth in revenue in 2023.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAs an investor, it can be difficult to balance data that tells two different stories. The valuation metrics for Cava Group are significantly worse than its peer competitors, but its growth prospects are phenomenal. What to do?\n\nIn this situation, it makes sense to circle back to the large investors discussed earlier. Artal and Shaich sold a combined 7 million shares so far this year, but they still have a significant ownership stake in Cava Group (over 35 million shares combined). With a recent, large run-up in price, their selling appears to be rebalancing and taking profits rather than running for the hills.\n\nInvestors should consider the same strategy. Taking some profits while valuation ratios are high is a great way to lessen your exposure to a potentially overvalued stock, but still have an opportunity for additional gains if the company is able to execute its growth strategy. If the stock falls, you will be pleased you sold some, but if the stock rises, you will be happy to gain more profits. Either way, it is a smart idea to follow what these large investors are doing.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Restaurant Stocks to Buy and Hold for Great Long-Term Potential",
        "content": "The restaurant industry is massive but highly competitive. As a result, plenty of restaurant stocks have fizzled out, but the industry has also produced some big winners. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG), for example, is more than a 50-bagger from its 2006 initial public offering (IPO).\n\nAfter a number of disappointments in the restaurant industry in the 2010s, investor expectations seem to have been reset, and that has set up two restaurant stocks for big potential gains. Let's take a closer look at them. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Cava Group\n\nPlenty of restaurant stocks have been dubbed the next Chipotle. Those have mostly disappointed, but Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) actually looks like the real deal.\n\nCava is a fast-casual chain focused on Mediterranean food, and its menu and decor closely resemble Chipotle. It offers rolled-up pita sandwiches that look like burritos, along with bowls, and its restaurants have the same industrial minimalist aesthetic that Chipotle is known for at its locations.\n\nBut it's not just the food that's reminiscent of Chipotle. Cava, which went public last June, also has the numbers to match. The company saw revenue jump 52.5% to $175.5 million in the fourth quarter, driven by rapid expansion and a same-store sales jump of 11.4% in the quarter. This shows that customers are returning frequently, a promising sign for the brand.\n\nCava also has a strong restaurant-level profit margin, at 22.4% in Q4 and more than 24% for the full year, not far behind Chipotle. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company is profitable, reporting a $2 million net income in Q4 as it's spending aggressively to grow the business.\n\nThe company also has backing from one of the most successful people in fast-casual history. Ron Shaich, the founder of Panera, is currently the Chairman of Cava, and was an early investor, recognizing the opportunity the company had.\n\nFinally, Cava shares also look reasonably valued, especially as the restaurant chain has a huge growth opportunity in front of it, finishing 2023 with 309 restaurants. The stock currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 5.4, a similar valuation to Chipotle. If Cava can maintain its current momentum, the stock has a lot of room for growth ahead of it.\n\n2. Sweetgreen\n\nLike Cava, Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG) is a fast-growing fast-casual stock, but it's still down substantially from the peak it reached after its IPO in 2021. Sweetgreen is the leader in the fast-casual salad niche. Its restaurants generate average unit volumes of $2.9 billion, on par with Chipotle, showing that the brand is popular.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has not yet reached profitability. It posted an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $1.8 million on $153 million in revenue.\n\nSweetgreen is also expanding quickly, with revenue up 29% on 6% same-store sales growth in Q4, but it has a unique asset up its sleeve that could drive significant growth over the coming years.\n\nThe company has developed an automated platform it calls the Infinite Kitchen. This is essentially a salad-making robot, and it's introduced the concept to two restaurants so far. The Infinite Kitchen has accelerated the company's throughput and saved on labor costs.\n\nSweetgreen is planning to accelerate the rollout of its Infinite Kitchen this year, adding it to seven new restaurants, and converting three to four large restaurants to Infinite Kitchens. The restaurant chain has also proven it has a popular menu and restaurant concept.\n\nBut the business fundamentals could use some improvement. Adding Infinite Kitchens could help differentiate from other restaurant chains, improve its customer service by speeding up throughput, and drive profitability as it saves the company on labor costs and increases revenue.\n\nWith just over 220 restaurants currently, Sweetgreen has a lot of room for growth both as a business and as a stock. At a price-to-sales ratio of 4, the shares have plenty of upside potential if the company can take steps toward profitability.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sweetgreen right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sweetgreen, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Sweetgreen wasn\u2019t one of them.

Chipotle's location in Kuwait marks the first time the company has entered a new country in over 10 years. Chipotle\u2019s new restaurant at The Avenues in Kuwait City will hold its official grand opening on April 23.\n\nThe new restaurant is located at The Avenues, Kuwait's largest shopping mall and a hub for international and local brands with over 1,100 stores and approximately one million visitors per week*.\n\nFor photos and B-roll video of\u00a0Chipotle's Kuwait City restaurant, see here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/untyp75stb06i84mo5j5c/AGr1V_1A2rBr0mgp6cTe3k8?rlkey=pct8qn1yz7m4c7q2366mpfxzi&st=3goiitg4&dl=0.\n\n\"In partnership with Alshaya Group, we worked tirelessly to ensure that we delivered an exceptional first impression in Kuwait with our freshly prepared menu of real ingredients and we are encouraged by the early results,\" said Chief Business Development Officer Nate Lawton. \"Together, we'll continue to gather insights on regional preferences and adapt accordingly as we grow our presence in the region and expand upon our mission to Cultivate a Better World.\"\n\nJohn Hadden, Chief Executive Officer, Alshaya Group, said: \"Consumers have long awaited Chipotle's arrival here in the Middle East and the feedback we've received so far has confirmed that we're delivering the same delicious culinary experience that guests have had in their U.S. locations. We're proud to have introduced this popular American restaurant to Kuwait and we're looking forward to Dubai later this year, as the first locations in our exclusive partnership with Chipotle.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nExpanding Access To simplify its ordering experience for new guests, the Kuwait restaurant in The Avenues Mall offers three ordering methods:\n\nGuests can order their craveable burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads in traditional Chipotle fashion by progressing through the front makeline and ordering ingredient by ingredient. The Kuwait restaurant features a kiosk ordering system that executes pick-up orders and enables menu exploration for first time guests. Tables at the restaurant feature QR codes that drive guests to download the Alshaya Chipotle mobile app for pick-up orders. This method is especially convenient for large families ordering multiple entrees. As a digital-only menu item, guests can order a quesadilla via the kiosk or mobile app.\n\nUnveiling a New Design The new location in Kuwait is the first Chipotle restaurant featuring the company's all new design format. Over the past several years, Chipotle's development team has been building out concepts that deploy new materials, textures, and artwork to amplify the company's commitment to Food with Integrity while paying homage to historic designs. New elements include:\n\nWood Tile Floor: replacing Chipotle's traditional concrete floor, it fills the restaurant with warmth and rich patterns. Corten Art Wall: the legacy architectural material is transformed into an elevated focal wall that heroes the iconic Chipotle pepper.

        "content": "Unpacking Q4 Earnings: Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) In The Context Of Other Modern Fast Food Stocks\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q4 now behind us, let\u2019s have a look at Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and its peers.\n\nModern fast food is a relatively newer category representing a middle ground between traditional fast food and sit-down restaurants. These establishments feature an expanded menu selection priced above traditional fast food options, often incorporating fresher and cleaner ingredients to serve customers prioritizing quality. These eateries are capitalizing on the perception that your drive-through burger and fries joint is detrimental to your health because of inferior ingredients.\n\nThe 6 modern fast food stocks we track reported a strong Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.6%, while next quarter's revenue guidance was 2.8% above consensus. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, but modern fast food stocks have shown resilience, with share prices up 5.3% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG)\n\nBorn from a desire to offer quick meals with fresh, flavorful ingredients, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a fast-food chain known for its healthy, Mexican-inspired cuisine and customizable dishes.\n\nChipotle reported revenues of $2.52 billion, up 15.4% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 1.1%. It was a very strong quarter for the company, with revenue, same-store sales, and EPS exceeding estimates. The company's outperformance was driven by strong year-on-year unit growth of 7.4%.\n\n\"2023 was an outstanding year where we delivered strong transaction growth driven by throughput and menu innovation, opened a record number of new restaurants, surpassed $3 million in AUVs and formed our first international partnership,\" said Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, Chipotle. Chipotle Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is up 15% since the results and currently trades at $2,867.99.\n\nRead why we think that Chipotle is one of the best modern fast food stocks, our full report is free.\n\nBest Q4: Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK)\n\nStarted as a hot dog cart in New York City's Madison Square Park, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) is a fast-food restaurant known for its burgers and milkshakes.\n\nShake Shack reported revenues of $286.2 million, up 20% year on year, outperforming analyst expectations by 2.2%. It was a stunning quarter for the company: Shake Shak beat across the board on all key metrics from same-store sales to revenue to profits to EPS. FCF even came in higher than expected and was positive rather than the loss projected by Wall Street analysts.\n\nStory continues Shake Shack Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is up 21.5% since the results and currently trades at $94.74.\n\nIs now the time to buy Shake Shack? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nWeakest Q4: Noodles (NASDAQ:NDLS)\n\nOffering pasta, mac and cheese, pad thai, and more, Noodles & Company (NASDAQ:NDLS) is a casual restaurant chain that serves all manner of noodles from around the world.\n\nNoodles reported revenues of $124.3 million, down 8.9% year on year, falling short of analyst expectations by 0.8%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with revenue and EPS falling below expectations thanks to worse-than-expected same-store sales performance (4.2% system-wide declines compared to estimates of 3.9%).\n\nNoodles had the weakest performance against analyst estimates, slowest revenue growth, and weakest full-year guidance update in the group. The stock is down 50.3% since the results and currently trades at $1.22.\n\nRead our full analysis of Noodles's results here.\n\nPotbelly (NASDAQ:PBPB)\n\nWith a unique origin story where the company actually started as an antique shop, Potbelly (NASDAQ:PBPB) today is a chain known for its toasty sandwiches.\n\nPotbelly reported revenues of $125.7 million, up 4.7% year on year, in line with analyst expectations. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' gross margin estimates but a miss of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nThe stock is down 22.6% since the results and currently trades at $10.44.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Potbelly here, it's free.\n\nSweetgreen (NYSE:SG)\n\nFounded in 2007 by three Georgetown University alum, Sweetgreen (NYSE:SG) is a casual quick service chain known for its healthy salads and bowls.\n\nSweetgreen reported revenues of $153 million, up 29.1% year on year, in line with analyst expectations. It was a strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' gross margin estimates. Next quarter's revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance came in higher than Wall Street's estimates. Finally, while full year revenue guidance was in line, adjusted EBITDA was better than Wall Street estimates.\n\nSweetgreen scored the fastest revenue growth and highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. The stock is up 61.8% since the results and currently trades at $20.65.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Sweetgreen here, it's free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "content": "Long term investing can be life changing when you buy and hold the truly great businesses. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. Don't believe it? Then look at the Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) share price. It's 324% higher than it was five years ago. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 23% gain in the last three months.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Chipotle Mexican Grill achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 48% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 33% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. Having said that, the market is still optimistic, given the P/E ratio of 64.03.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our freereport on Chipotle Mexican Grill's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Chipotle Mexican Grill has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 59% in the last twelve months. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 33% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

        "title": "Fed's favorite inflation gauge and Big Tech earnings greet a slumping stock market: What to know this week",
        "content": "The market rally is at its most fragile point in months.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended Friday below 5,000, its first close below that mark since late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped more than 5% on the week while the Dow held flat.\n\nThis week, critical readings on economic growth and inflation, as well as the start of Big Tech earnings, will determine if the malaise continues.\n\nOn the economic data side, the advanced reading of first quarter economic growth is slated for Thursday, followed by the March reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, a slew of S&P 500 companies are expected to report quarterly results headlined by Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), and Chipotle (CMG).\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge\n\nSeveral months of bumpy inflation readings have forced investors to scale back their projections for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year.\n\nOn Friday, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said \"progress on inflation has stalled\" when noting that it \"makes sense\" for the central bank to wait for more clarity on inflation's path.\n\nThis makes Friday's PCE reading all the more critical.\n\nEconomists expect \"core\" PCE clocked in at 2.7% in March from the previous year, down from February's 2.8% annual gain. Over the prior month, economists expect \"core\" PCE rose 0.3%, in line with last month's change.\n\n\"Should core PCE inflation come in around 0.25% [month-over-month] for March and April, the year-on-year reading will slow from 2.8% to 2.6%, giving the Fed cover to begin 'gradually' adjusting policy rates lower starting in June or July,\" Citi economist Andrew Hollenhorst wrote in a note to clients on April 17.\n\nGrowth update\n\nPart of the reason investors had largely taken the repricing of Fed interest rate cuts in stride has been an increasingly positive economic backdrop. Throughout the first quarter, economists have been raising their projections for economic growth. Thursday will bring the first look at whether the US economy grew as fast as forecast in the first three months of this year.\n\nEconomists expect that the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% in the first quarter, lower than the 3.4% seen in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\"Incoming data continue to point to ongoing economic resilience in an environment of higher rates,\" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"The consumer continues to remain strong. The economy has cooled modestly since the outsized 4.9% growth rate seen in 3Q, but what cooling there is has been gradual.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings aren't impressing\n\nGiven the significant run-up in share price that some of the market rally's darlings have experienced this year, even better-than-expected earnings aren't moving the needle for stocks.\n\n\"The broader market is having digestion problems in and around this earnings season,\" Julian Emanuel, who leads Evercore ISI's equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis has broadly been seen across stock reactions the day following the release of quarterly results for the 65 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far this season. Stocks that top Wall Street's estimates have risen 0.8% in the next trading session, slightly lower than the 0.9% average seen over the last few years, per Emanuel's research.\n\nMeanwhile, companies that disappoint on both metrics are taking a bigger hit than normal, with the average stock falling 5.8% in the next trading action, compared to the usual 3.1% decline seen over the past five years.\n\n\"Given these extended valuations [in the S&P 500], even good news may not be good news, particularly in these names that have run as far as they have,\" Emanuel said.\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nWith earnings reports not satisfying investors, the baton will be passed to one of the strongest parts of the market over the past year: Big Tech.\n\nDespite a sell-off across tech last week after disappointing results from chipmakers and Netflix (NFLX), earnings growth expectations are still sky-high for Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet, which are all expected to report in the week ahead.\n\nFactSet noted on Friday that these companies, along with Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN), are expected to have grown earnings by 64.3% in the first quarter. The other 495 companies are projected to see earnings decline by 6%.\n\nSurging yields\n\nOutside of earnings, investors will closely watch the economic data this week to see how it might shift movements in rising bond yields, which are becoming a pain point for investors again.\n\nThe 2-year Treasury yield shot up to 5% on Tuesday for the first time since the most recent stock market bottom in October 2023. The move came as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it's taking \"longer than expected\" for inflation to fall to its 2% target.\n\nAnd Evercore ISI's Emanuel believes this will be a key pain point for stocks, just as it was during a sell-off in the market last fall.\n\n\"The reason it might be more of the concern at this point is because of that implicit promise that markets have traded on of three [Fed rate] cuts dialed back,\" Emanuel said. \"And if you look at it going back to March, I think it's a lot more than a confidence the market rolled over from the highs literally precisely the moment the market started pricing in fewer than those three promised cuts.\"\n\nEmanuel cautioned that it might be time to get defensive in the market because of this. He recommended exposure to sectors such as Health Care (XLV) and Consumer Staples (XLP) while also noting the roughly 5% that can be earned by holding cash in a money market account is still a viable portion of a portfolio.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed Nat Activity Index, March (+0.05 prior)\n\nEarnings: Albertsons (ACI), Bank of Hawaii (BOH), Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), Nucor (NUE), SAP (SAP), Truist (TFC), Verizon (VZ), Zions Bancorporation (ZION)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, April, preliminary (52.0 expected, 51.9 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, April, preliminary (52 expected, 51.9 previously); S&P Global US composite PMI, April, preliminary (52 expected, 52.1 previously); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, April (-11 prior); New home sales, March (670,000 expected, 662,000 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, March (1.2% expected, -0.3% previously)\n\nEarnings:  Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), General Electric (GE), General Motors (GM), Halliburton (HAL), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Mattel (MAT), PepsiCo (PEP), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Spotify (SPOT), Steel Dynamics (STLD), Tesla (TSLA), UPS (UPS), Texas Instruments (TXN), Visa (V)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending April 19 (+3.3% prior); Durable Goods Orders, March preliminary (+2.5% expected, +1.3% prior)\n\nEarnings: Meta Platforms (META), AT&T (T), Boeing (BA), Chipotle (CMG), Ford (F), Humana (HUM), ADP (ADP), eBay (EBAY), General Dynamics (GD), Hilton (HLT), IBM (IBM), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY), ServiceNow (NOW), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: First quarter GDP, first estimate (+2.5% annualized rate expected, +3.4% previously); First quarter personal consumption, first estimate (+2.6% expected, 3.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ended, April 20 (215,000 expected, 212,000 previously); Pending home sales, month-over-month, March (+1.0% expected, +1.6% previously)\n\nEarnings: Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), American Airlines (AAL), AstraZeneca (AZN), Caterpillar (CAT), Intel (INTC), Mobileye (MBLY), Roku (ROKU), Snap (SNAP), Royal Caribbean (RCL), Southwest (LUV), T-Mobile (TMUS)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Personal income, month-over-month, March (+0.5% expected, +0.3% previously); Personal spending, month-over-month, March (+0.6% expected, +0.8% previously); PCE inflation, month-over-month, March (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); PCE inflation, year-over-year, March (+2.6% expected, +2.5% previously); \"Core\" PCE, month-over-month, March (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); \"Core\" PCE, year-over-year, March (+2.7% expected; +2.8% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, April, final reading (77.9 expected, 77.9 previously)\n\nEarnings: Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Charter Communications (CHTR), Colgate (CL)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "One of the Top Billionaire Investors Owns 37% of This Real Estate Company \u2013 and I Can't Believe It's This Cheap",
        "content": "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman is best known for his large stakes in companies like Chipotle(NYSE: CMG) and Restaurant Brands International(NYSE: QSR), but there's one stock in the portfolio of Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund that could be the most interesting investment of all.\n\nI'm talking about Howard Hughes Holdings(NYSE: HHH), which is one of the most unique real estate companies in the market. Pershing Square owns about 18.8 million shares worth $1.6 billion at the current price, which gives Ackman and his investors a 37% stake in Howard Hughes.\n\nSince this company isn't exactly a household name, here's a quick overview of what it does, some of the reasons why Ackman might like it so much, and what to keep in mind if you decide to invest.\n\nWhat does Howard Hughes Holdings do?\n\nHoward Hughes Holdings' primary business is developing master-planned communities, or MPCs. These are large-scale developments that could be more accurately describes as small cities, rather than the smaller neighborhoods you might think of when you hear the term \"communities.\"\n\nSome major examples of the company's MPCs include The Woodlands and a couple of other communities in the Houston area with over 140,000 residents. There's the 22,500-acre Summerlin community in Las Vegas. And the oldest of the group is Columbia, Maryland, which is located between D.C. and Baltimore.\n\nHoward Hughes' business model is designed for long-term value creation. The company acquires a large piece of land (such as the 37,000 acres it acquired in the Phoenix area a couple years ago), and sells a small portion of it to homebuilders, who develop residential communities. The presence of these homes creates demand for commercial assets like offices and retail properties, which Howard Hughes builds and collects rental income from. These commercial amenities make the surrounding land more valuable to homebuilders, so they sell some more land. This cycle can continue for decades.\n\nIn addition to its master-planned community business, Howard Hughes has a few other businesses. It owns the Seaport in New York City, owns a minority stake in Jean-Georges Restaurants, owns a Triple-A baseball team in Las Vegas, and more. It plans to spin off the non-MPC parts of the business, perhaps later this year.\n\nTons of long-tailed potential\n\nAs of the latest information, Howard Hughes owns 6.8 million square feet of office properties, 2.6 million square feet of retail space, nearly 6,000 multifamily housing units, and has about 35,000 acres of developable land remaining. The company believes it can increase its NOI bv nearly 40% from 2023 levels from stabilizing its current portfolio (especially offices), with even more to come from assets under construction.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen it comes to developing commercial properties, Howard Hughes is in perhaps its most active development period ever. It currently has 1.7 million square feet under construction and expects to spend $1.8 billion on development. The company sees near-term development opportunities of 1.8 million square feet in The Woodlands, over 2 million square feet in Summerlin, and a massive opportunity to add office, retail, and multifamily properties in Downtown Columbia.\n\nThe Ward Village MPC in Hawaii could be a big future revenue generator. There are four new condo towers either under construction or in pre-sales, and these represent $2.6 billion in future revenue by themselves, with four more buildings planned from 2027 through 2030.\n\nThe Phoenix-area MPC represents a massive and decades-long opportunity. The first village in the community is under development now, and the company aims to build the MPC (known as Teravalis) into a community of 100,000 homes, 300,000 residents, and 55 million square feet of commercial space.\n\nFinally, the spinoff of the non-MPC assets could help unlock value. The Seaport in NYC is an iconic development that is just starting to realize its full potential. There's a new high-rise mixed-use development about to start construction that will have 547,000 square feet of space.\n\nA great business at a huge discount\n\nHoward Hughes could be an amazing deep value play for patient investors. At the company's 2023 Investor Day in September, management made the case for a $129 per-share net asset value (NAV), more than twice the current stock price. And as interest rates start to come down, NAV could grow significantly as borrowing costs decline and commercial real estate valuations rise.\n\nHaving said that, it's important to understand that if you buy shares of Howard Hughes Corporation, it's important to understand that it is designed with ultra-long-term value creation in mind. It's a difficult business for the market to value, and it can be rather volatile over short periods.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Howard Hughes right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Howard Hughes, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Howard Hughes wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Could Chipotle Mexican Grill Help You Retire a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Those who have already owned shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) for years are familiar with the stock's potential -- it's generated stellar investment returns and life-changing wealth. A $10,000 investment at the time of its 2006 IPO would be worth over $660,000 today.\n\nSometimes the best business models are the simplest, and it doesn't get more straightforward than meat, beans, and rice. How has Chipotle turned such simple food into an empire? Here is the company's secret to success, and why the stock can help you retire a millionaire.\n\nChipotle packs flavor and variety in every bite\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Chipotle, it's a Mexican food casual dining chain that operates primarily in the United States. Today there are 3,437 restaurants, all company-operated. Customers can enjoy a small, focused menu of select proteins and vegetables served as burritos, bowls, or salads.\n\nThe genius of Chipotle's menu is its simplicity, yet it offers so many customization options. Customers specify every aspect of the product, which comes with simple choices like white or brown rice and mild, medium, or hot salsa. The simplicity means Chipotle can control inventory and use fresh ingredients, bolstering product quality and customer experience.\n\nLike other successful restaurant models, Chipotle has spent years building brand power and locking customer loyalty with a rewards program. Chipotle's size and control over its stores give it the benefits of size and scale, which makes replicating the model and food quality difficult at Chipotle's price points.\n\nBig profits drive expansion\n\nChipotle's financial flywheel is also simple. The more stores Chipotle opens, the more it can drive down costs with its size. The more profits Chipotle makes, the more stores it can open. It's a beautiful chicken-and-egg example that has helped the company steadily expand for over two decades. Chipotle is a juggernaut today with nearly $10 billion in annual sales.\n\nThe first Chipotle opened in the early 1990s, and it took nearly 20 years to open its thousandth store. But the store count has more than tripled in the 14 years since then.\n\nAnd there's more. Chipotle doesn't need to invest every dollar in the business as profits build up. So it's repurchased shares over the years, slowly shrinking its share count, which means more profits per share of company stock: CMG Free Cash Flow Per Share Chart\n\nThis is the secret recipe and the primary reason Chipotle stock has been a winning investment.\n\nWill the recipe keep working?\n\nChipotle's recipe is why the stock could help you retire a millionaire (as part of a diversified portfolio). Simply put, 3,300 restaurants aren't that many in the grand scheme. Here are the U.S. store counts for some popular restaurant chains:\n\nStory continues\n\nTaco Bell: 7,936 KFC: 4,290 McDonald's: 13,528 Starbucks: 16,482\n\nAs you can see, Chipotle is a fraction of the size of most direct and indirect competitors. Additionally, I like Chipotle's international potential due to the freshness of its food and the cultural diversity that its food represents. Chipotle has a handful of locations in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and is opening up in the Middle East.\n\nA global footprint of 10,000 stores doesn't seem out of reach, meaning investors have years of growth ahead. Plus, how many shares will management gobble up over the next decade? Could Chipotle see a quarter of its shares retired? There's no way of knowing for sure, but it seems that Chipotle's recipe for success is something it can continue replicating for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt doesn't have to be complicated to be effective. Chipotle is a stock long-term investors can buy, tuck away, and glance at a couple of times every year to make sure the train is still on the tracks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reached $2,869.11, with a -1.34% movement compared to the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.88% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.56%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.05%.\n\nThe Mexican food chain's shares have seen an increase of 0.1% over the last month, surpassing the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 2.7% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.57%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Chipotle Mexican Grill in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on April 24, 2024. In that report, analysts expect Chipotle Mexican Grill to post earnings of $11.56 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 10.1%. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $2.68 billion, indicating a 12.98% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $53.36 per share and revenue of $11.25 billion. These totals would mark changes of +18.95% and +13.95%, respectively, from last year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Chipotle Mexican Grill should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

While higher yields and a desire to keep rates the same can dampen the mood in the short run, some growth stocks can deliver enticing long-term returns.\n\nInvestments with the potential to generate explosive returns are volatile in nature. You will have to endure sharp price movements from time to time. However, if these corporations continue to thrive with their growth initiatives, they can become some of the top picks in the stock market.

It\u2019s a stock worth monitoring, and if it drops low enough, the stock can become a captivating buying opportunity. The business model is solid.\n\nRevenue increased by 45% year-over-year in\u00a0Q4 2023,\u00a0while net income came in at $12.1 million.

Duolingo\u2019s net profit margin was above 8% compared to a 2% net profit margin in Q3 2023.\n\nThe difference is even more apparent with full-year results. Full-year 2023 net income came in at $16.1 million compared to a net loss of $59.6 million in the same period last year.\n\nUser growth rates also came in hot.

Value investors won\u2019t like this one, but the growth stock has the potential to outperform the market for a while.

While those numbers are good, Chipotle\u2019s guidance is even better. If everything goes according to plan, the company will have opened 285-315 restaurants in 2024.\n\nChipotle is still expanding, so it\u2019s not in the position to offer dividends quite yet. However, the company did initiate $589.8 million in stock buybacks with an average price per share of $1,827.46.

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on Apr 24. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 6.5%.\n\nHow Are Estimates Placed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $11.56, indicating growth of 10.1% from $10.5 registered in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nFor revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at nearly $2.7 billion, suggesting an increase of 12.8% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s figure.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Quote\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the quarter to be reported.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nChipotle's first-quarter top line is expected to increase year over year, courtesy of its digital initiatives, Chipotlane add-ons and new restaurant openings. This and the focus on leveraging customer data and insights to develop more tailored marketing campaigns are likely to have boosted customer frequency and engagement in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of new menu items is likely to have driven transactions in the first quarter. Our model predicts first-quarter food and beverage revenues to increase 12.2% year over year to $2.6 billion. Delivery service revenues are expected to be $18.2 million, suggesting an increase of 3.5% year over year.\n\nStrong comps growth, backed by transaction growth and marketing efforts, is likely to have aided the company\u2019s top line in the first quarter. Our model predicts first-quarter comps growth to be at 4.7% year over year.\r\n\r\nElevated costs concerning avocados and tortillas and wage pressures are likely to have hurt margins in the first quarter. CMG anticipates the cost of sales to be in the low 29% range in the first quarter, while labor costs are expected in the low 25% range. Other operating costs are expected to be in the high 14% range.\r\n\r\nOur model predicts food, beverage and packaging costs to be $775 million, up 11.9% year over year. Per the model, labor costs are expected to increase 14.4% year over year to $668.1 million. Our model predicts a restaurant-level margin of 25.5%.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Chipotle this time around.

        "content": "The upcoming report from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $11.56 per share, indicating an increase of 10.1% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $2.68 billion, representing an increase of 13% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 0.2% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Chipotle metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenues- Food and beverage' will reach $2.65 billion. The estimate points to a change of +12.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenues- Delivery service' reaching $17.05 million. The estimate suggests a change of -3% year over year.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Total restaurants' should arrive at 3,487. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 3,224 in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Comparable restaurant sales' will reach 5.1%. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 10.9%.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Number of company-owned restaurants - Opened' stands at 59. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 41 in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Number of company-owned restaurants - Beginning of period' at 3,437. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 3,187 in the same quarter of the previous year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Chipotle here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, Chipotle shares have recorded returns of +0.1% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.6% change.

        "title": "Meet the Stock-Split Stock Making Wall Street History, Plus the Nasdaq Stock That Could Split Next",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) made history when it announced a 50-for-1 stock split last month. Assuming shareholders approve the amendment at the annual meeting on June 6, the stock will split after the market closes on June 25.\n\nThat announcement is historic for two reasons. First, Chipotle has never split its stock since it was founded 30 years ago. Second, it will be one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) history, with shareholders receiving 49 additional shares for each share owned.\n\nStock splits can be useful to investors -- not only because they make shares cheaper, but also because they can spotlight competitively advantaged companies. That is to say, the substantial price appreciation that typically precedes a stock split rarely happens to mediocre companies.\n\nRead on to learn more about Chipotle, plus the Nasdaq stock that could split next.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill: The stock split making history on Wall Street\n\nThe fourth quarter was difficult for many restaurant businesses because of economic headwinds, but Chipotle reported strong financial results. Revenue increased 15% to $2.5 billion, operating margin expanded 80 basis points, and non-GAAP net income jumped 25% to $10.36 per diluted share. The company opened a record 121 new restaurants during the quarter. Management also highlighted improved throughput and strong same-store sales as key growth drivers.\n\nI want to elaborate on that last point. Chipotle's same-store sales increased 8.4% driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions (more customer traffic) and a 1% increase in the average check (pricing power). Those figures are exceptional compared to the broader restaurant industry, where same-store sales increase just 1.1% in December and customer traffic actually declined 1.7%, according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nThat pattern is nothing new. Chipotle consistently reports above-average growth in same-store sales and transactions because it has built brand loyalty. Specifically, its focus on responsibly raised meats, organically grown produce, and fresh ingredients -- no freezers, no can openers, and no microwaves -- clearly resonates with the market. That competitive advantage should keep the company growing for the foreseeable future, especially when its location count is expected to expand at an annual rate of 8% to 10%.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Chipotle to grow earnings per share at 20% annually over the next five years. That is impressive, but it still makes the current valuation of 66.7 times earnings look pricey. However, Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop thinks Chipotle will grow earnings per share at 20% annually over the next 10 years. That sustained growth over a longer time period makes the current valuation look more tolerable, though still not cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nPersonally, I would keep this stock on my watchlist for now. Chipotle is an excellent company and its 50-for-1 stock split is certainly historic. But stock splits themselves have no impact on important business fundamentals, and I question whether Chipotle can produce above-average returns from its current price.\n\nMicrosoft: The Nasdaq stock that could split next\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) shares rocketed 249% during the last five years. That monster price appreciation qualifies the company as a stock split candidate, but it also points to a probable competitive advantage. Indeed, Microsoft is the largest enterprise software company and the second-largest cloud services provider. Those achievements are built on brand authority, patented technology, and switching costs, meaning that switching software and cloud services providers is a cumbersome process.\n\nStrength in software comes from its business productivity platform (Microsoft 365) and enterprise resource planning platform (Dynamics 365). The former includes office applications like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, while the latter includes tools for sales, customer service, and supply chain management. In total, Microsoft accounted for 18% of enterprise software sales last year, representing 60 basis points in market share gains from the previous year.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Azure still trails Amazon Web Services in the cloud infrastructure and platform services (CIPS) market, but strength in data management, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence (AI) have contributed to significant market share gains. Azure accounted for 24% of CIPS spending during the December quarter, representing nearly 200 basis points in market share gains from the previous year. Morgan Stanley expects that to momentum continue, such that Microsoft overtakes Amazon as the market leader by 2027.\n\nMicrosoft reported strong financial results in the December quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 18% to $62 billion on momentum in office software and Azure cloud services, though the Activision acquisition contributed four points to revenue growth. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income increased 26% to $2.93 per share because of operating margin expansion, a trend management says will continue in the coming quarters.\n\nGoing forward, Microsoft has its most significant opportunities in enterprise software and cloud services, markets forecasted to grow at 14% annually through 2030. But the company has an incremental opportunity in generative artificial intelligence, a market forecasted to grow at 43% annually through 2032. Microsoft is leaning into that opportunity with its generative AI assistant Microsoft 365 Copilot. Additionally, Azure offers a broad range of AI and machine learning services, including the ability to build generative AI software with OpenAI models.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft to grow sales at 14% annually over the next five years. Shares currently trade at 13.9 time sales, a premium to the three-year average of 11.6 times sales and a pricey valuation versus Wall Street's consensus sales estimate. But I think analysts are underestimating the company's ability to monetize AI, such that sales may increase one or two points faster over the next five years.\n\nIn that scenario, better-than-expected sales growth could lead to above-average returns for patient shareholders. I think investors should consider buying a small position in this stock right now, with the understanding that Microsoft is a $3.1 trillion company that is unlikely to match its five-year return of 249% over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Q4 Rundown: Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) Vs Other Modern Fast Food Stocks\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q4 now behind us, let\u2019s have a look at Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) and its peers.\n\nModern fast food is a relatively newer category representing a middle ground between traditional fast food and sit-down restaurants. These establishments feature an expanded menu selection priced above traditional fast food options, often incorporating fresher and cleaner ingredients to serve customers prioritizing quality. These eateries are capitalizing on the perception that your drive-through burger and fries joint is detrimental to your health because of inferior ingredients.\n\nThe 6 modern fast food stocks we track reported a strong Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.6%, while next quarter's revenue guidance was 2.8% above consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, though the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, but modern fast food stocks have shown resilience, with share prices up 6.4% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nWingstop (NASDAQ:WING)\n\nThe passion project of two chicken wing aficionados in Texas, Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) is a popular fast-food chain known for its flavorful and crispy chicken wings offered in a variety of sauces and seasonings.\n\nWingstop reported revenues of $127.1 million, up 21.2% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 5.7%. It was an exceptional quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' revenue, EBITDA, and EPS estimates, driven by 21% same-store sales growth (estimates of 15%), 24.5% system-wide sales growth (estimates of 17.9%), and 115 net new restaurant openings (estimates of 105).\n\n\"2023 marked the strongest year on record for Wingstop where we achieved 18.3% domestic same store sales growth, driven primarily by transactions, and we delivered an unprecedented 20 consecutive years of domestic same store sales growth,\" said Michael Skipworth, President and Chief Executive Officer. Wingstop Total Revenue\n\nWingstop achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat of the whole group. The stock is up 10.4% since the results and currently trades at $358.63.\n\nRead why we think that Wingstop is one of the best modern fast food stocks, our full report is free.\n\nBest Q4: Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK)\n\nStarted as a hot dog cart in New York City's Madison Square Park, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) is a fast-food restaurant known for its burgers and milkshakes.\n\nStory continues\n\nShake Shack reported revenues of $286.2 million, up 20% year on year, outperforming analyst expectations by 2.2%. It was a stunning quarter for the company: Shake Shak\u00a0beat across the board on all key metrics from same-store sales to revenue to profits to EPS. FCF even came in higher than expected and was positive rather than the loss projected by Wall Street analysts.

It was a weak quarter for the company, with revenue and EPS falling below expectations\u00a0thanks to worse-than-expected same-store sales performance (4.2% system-wide declines compared to estimates of 3.9%).\n\nNoodles had the weakest performance against analyst estimates, slowest revenue growth, and weakest full-year guidance update in the group. The stock is down 47.5% since the results and currently trades at $1.29.\n\nRead our full analysis of Noodles's results here.\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG)\n\nBorn from a desire to offer quick meals with fresh, flavorful ingredients, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a fast-food chain known for its healthy, Mexican-inspired cuisine and customizable dishes.\n\nChipotle reported revenues of $2.52 billion, up 15.4% year on year, surpassing analyst expectations by 1.1%.

        "title": "Time to Buy Chipotle Before Its Massive Stock Split?",
        "content": "A lot of people seem to care about stock splits, so much so that we even have a dedicated calendar for them at The Motley Fool. A huge split is coming up for Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG), which is doing a 50-to-1 exchange, estimated to occur on June 26. Investors have gotten excited and sent shares of Chipotle close to all-time highs at around $3,000 a share.\n\nI am here to tell you that stock splits don't matter. A stock is worth the future cash it will distribute back to shareholders, discounted back to today. For Chipotle, it is irrelevant whether it has one share that trades at a price of $80 billion (its current market capitalization) or 80 billion shares trading for $1. An investor will make money if the company generates more in earnings.\n\nForgetting the irrelevant stock split, how does Chipotle stack up when doing fundamental analysis? Should you buy the stock at current prices? Let's take a closer look and find out.\n\nA lot of room for store count growth\n\nAs the premier fast-casual restaurant chain for Mexican grub, Chipotle now has 3,437 store units, mostly in the United States. Over the long term it plans to open 7,000 stores in North America, and it is starting to dip its toe into international markets. Specifically, it has a few stores opened in Western European markets, and just launched a partnership to bring Chiptole to Dubai and the Middle East.\n\nWhile it is unclear how many locations Chipotle plans to build internationally, I think it is reasonable for the company to hit a few thousand at some point over the next decade or two, especially if it moves to other markets such as Australia. That would bring it to a total addressable market of at least 10,000 restaurants, which I don't think is crazy. McDonald's, for reference, has over 40k locations worldwide.\n\nHow much would this mean in sales? Today, the average Chipotle generates $3 million in annual sales, a number that has grown at a single-digit rate in recent years as the company keeps up with inflation. Eventually, Chipotle should hit an average restaurant sales level of $3.5 million. Apply that to 10,000 locations and you have $35 billion in annual sales compared to $10 billion today. Of course, there are many years of growth needed to hit these sales figures, but Chiptole has a clear line of sight to achieving these growth goals.\n\nCan profit margins keep moving higher?\n\nOkay, we have some estimates on Chipotle's sales potential. Now let's move to what really matters to investors: profits. Chipotle has done a great job in recent years to expand its operating margin, recovering back to 16.5% in the last 12 months. It has taken almost 10 years for the company to recover from its food-borne sickness outbreak, when profit margins were pushing toward 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the long term, investors should expect some small levels of operating leverage as Chipotle further scales around the globe. Don't expand massive margins from a restaurant concept, though. There will always be major labor and food costs for Chipotle, which will likely keep its profit margins in the 15%-20% range.\n\nAssuming Chipotle can hit an 18% consolidated margin at its $35 billion future sales estimate at 10k locations, the company will be generating $6.3 billion in annual profits at some point down the line. CMG Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nDon't worry about a stock split, focus on valuation\n\nAgain, investors shouldn't worry about a 50-to-1 stock split for Chipotle. It has no bearing on the intrinsic value of Chipotle, how many people are going to visit its stores, or any of its input costs. What matters is how much it will earn in cash for shareholders in the coming years.\n\nI think Chipotle can generate over $6 billion in earnings once it hits 10,000 locations. At a current market cap of $80 billion, that would give Chipotle stock a cheap-looking price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 13. The problem is that it will take Chipotle many years to reach this earnings level. Even if it ups its store opening rate to 400 a year (it opened 271 in 2023), it will take Chipotle over 16 years to reach 10,000 locations worldwide.\n\nThis is not an overnight growth story like Nvidia. Chipotle is a good business, but one where 10-plus years of earnings growth is already priced in. Forget the stock split -- this is why you should avoid buying shares of Chipotle stock. The stock is overvalued right now and likely to disappoint investors who buy today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis Mexican food chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $11.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.6%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.67 billion, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.62% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chipotle?\n\nFor Chipotle, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.73%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Chipotle will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Chipotle would post earnings of $9.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $10.36, delivering a surprise of +6.47%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nChipotle appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Restaurant Stocks to Buy Now: Q2 Edition",
        "content": "Restaurants and their stocks have been on a rollercoaster since the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. Over the past four years, companies running restaurant chains have had to contend with store closures, operating at reduced capacity, moving their operations almost entirely online, reopening physical locations, food inflation, high interest rates, and consumers tightening their purse strings. The results have roiled restaurant stocks and made them difficult securities to own.\n\nSo far in 2024, the S&P 500 Restaurant Sub-Index is about flat on the year (down 1%). However, over the last six months, the index has risen 14%, showing notable improvement in the sector. Among restaurant stocks, a handful continue to outperform driven by strong sales and profits that have exceeded Wall Street forecasts. There are also several restaurant companies that have undertaken multi-year growth strategies coming out of the pandemic and are worth a look.\n\nHere are three restaurant stocks to buy now: Q2 edition.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR) A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant representing QSR stock.\n\nSource: Savvapanf Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere\u2019s an opportunity to buy shares of Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) on weakness. So far this year, QSR stock is down 7%. The decline comes despite the company\u2019s latest financial results beating analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines, and as it successfully executes a multi-year revitalization of the Burger King franchise. Restaurant Brands owns Popeyes Chicken, Firehouse Subs and the Tim Hortons coffee chain, in addition to its flagship Burger King outlets.\n\nFor the final quarter of 2023, Restaurant Brands International reported earnings per share (EPS) of 75 cents versus 73 cents that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue came in at $1.82 billion compared to $1.81 billion that was forecast. Total sales were up 8% from a year earlier. The company said it is seeing positive results from its Burger King turnaround strategy that includes remodeling restaurants and spending more money on advertising to drive customer traffic and sales.\n\nThe average price target on QSR stock among 22 Wall Street analysts is $115.40, which is 18% higher than where it currently trades.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is riding high on strong earnings and plans to split its stock for the first time. The restaurant chain that specializes in Mexican cuisine has announced a 50-for-1 stock split to be executed in June of this year. The stock split will be the first ever for Chipotle, which went public in 2006 and whose shares are currently trading at just under $3,000.00, putting them out of reach for many retail investors. The 50-for-1 stock split will lower Chipotle\u2019s share price to around $60.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle\u2019s stock is expected to begin trading on a split adjusted basis when the market opens on June 26. News of the stock split comes as Chipotle continues to issue strong financial results that almost always beat Wall Street expectations.\n\nMost recently, Chipotle reported EPS of $10.36 compared to $9.75 that was expected amongst analysts. Revenue came in at $2.52 billion versus $2.49 billion that was forecast on Wall Street. Sales were up 15% from a year earlier. CMG stock has risen 67% in the last 12 months, including a 32% year-to-date gain.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) is another restaurant stock that is flying high. Over the past year, DPZ stock has increased 50%, including a 20% gain since January of this year. Domino\u2019s also continues to deliver better-than-expected financial results, and recently raised its quarterly dividend by 25%. Domino\u2019s now pays its shareholders a quarterly dividend of $1.51 a share, up from $1.21 previously. The pizza delivery giant has also announced a new $1 billion stock buyback program.\n\nThe dividend increase and stock buyback were announced along with strong Q4 2023 results. Domino\u2019s Pizza achieved EPS of $4.48, which topped expectations of $4.38. Revenue amounted to $1.40 billion, which about matched forecasts on Wall Street.\n\nSame-store sales in the U.S. grew by 2.8% from a year earlier. Late last year, Domino\u2019s management team announced a new growth strategy that aims to open 1,100 stores through 2028 and increase its retail sales by 7% a year on average.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Meritage Hospitality Group Inc. (MHGU) shares ended the last trading session 5.4% higher at $18.56. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 3.8% loss over the past four weeks.\n\nMeritage Hospitality Group rally is buoyed by optimism regarding the company\u2019s focus on renovations and new restaurant development, along with acquisitions. The focus remains on leveraging its robust operating platform and in-house restaurant development expertise. Positive investor sentiments were witnessed on the company's solid first quarter 2024 results and strong 2024 Outlook. The performance was driven by profitable value menu sales and decreased inflation in food, paper, and labor.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +183.3%. Revenues are expected to be $177.8 million, up 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Meritage Hospitality Group, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on MHGU going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "Not-So-Happy Meal: $20 Wages Has Burger Joints In This State All Heated\n\nCalifornia fast-food employees started earning a minimum of $20 an hour in April.\n\nThanks to a new law, which went into effect earlier this month, California chain restaurants with at least 60 locations nationwide have to pay their employees more.\n\nFor smaller restaurants, the minimum wage continues to be the statewide bottom of $16 an hour.\n\nThe largest publicly-traded fast-food companies include McDonald\u2019s Corp (NYSE:MCD); Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX); Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC; Wendys Co (NASDAQ:WEN); Restaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE:QSR), which owns Burger King; Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG); Papa John\u2019s International Inc (NASDAQ:PZZA) and Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ:JACK).\n\nMany of these stocks have lost value since the law was implemented on April 1.\n\nRead Also: AI Gunning For Fast Food Jobs Next? KFC, Taco Bell Operator Yum Brands Planning ChatGPT-Like Bots To Boost Operations\n\nThe wage hikes were deemed necessary in the Golden State. After all, the cost of living in California is about 38% higher than the national average.\n\nSome fast food companies are considering cutting employee hours and raising menu prices.\n\nIn-N-OutBurger President Lynsi Snyder said in an interview with Today that she \"was sitting in VP meetings going toe-to-toe saying, \u2018We can't raise the prices that much, we can't.\u2019\"\n\nHer company, which owns over 400 restaurants \u2014 primarily in California \u2014 continues to be privately held. Snyder said there are no plans to go public or open up to the franchise model.\n\nIn-N-Out has, however, raised prices in Los Angeles restaurants by about 25 cents per burger. That\u2019s still less than the price hikes other restaurants had to implement.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, one Burger King in Los Angeles raised the price of its Double Texas Whopper by 12% from $15.09 to $16.89.\n\nMany restaurant chains started preparing for wage hikes, even before the law was passed last September. Some companies are exploring automation as a strategy \u2014 a trend that took off in 2017 with self-service ordering kiosks.\n\nInsider reported that some restaurant franchises, including a major Burger King franchise, are ordering new digital order kiosks to replace existing staff.\n\nBurger King management recently pointed out that customers tend to order larger meals whenever interacting with digital self-service screens.\n\nIn October, after California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the law, McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's third-quarter earnings call he expected the policy to \"certainly be a hit in the short term to franchisee cashflow.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nYet the secondary effects of the new law could even replicate into further trouble for the fast food segment in the Golden State. A Jack in the Box franchise owner speculated on Sunday in an interview with Business Insider that rising prices for fast food chains could mean a loss in market share to casual diners like Chili\u2019s, owned by Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT) or Applebee\u2019s, a subsidiary of Dine Brands Global Inc (NYSE:DIN).\n\nCasual dining restaurants could, in turn, benefit if they're able to keep running without altering prices.\n\nNow Read: Wendy\u2019s Clarifies \u2018Dynamic Pricing\u2019 Comments After Public Outcry, Elizabeth Warren Criticism\n\nImage from MidJourney AI.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Not-So-Happy Meal: $20 Wages Has Burger Joints In This State All Heated originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "3 High-Priced Stocks That Should Follow Chipotle\u2019s 50-for-1 Split",
        "content": "On March 19, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) announced the first stock split in its history. When it comes to high-priced stocks, they don\u2019t get much higher than Chipotle. It trades a few dollars shy of $3,000, making it one of the most obvious stock-split candidates.\n\nThe restaurant chain opted for a 50-to-1 split of its stock. Shareholders will vote on the stock split at its annual meeting on June 6. If approved, shareholders will receive 49 new shares for every share held.\n\n\u201cThis is the first stock split in Chipotle\u2019s 30-year history, and we believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors,\u201d said Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, Chipotle. \u201cThis split comes at a time when our stock is experiencing an all-time high driven by record revenues, profits, and growth.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe argument that companies do stock splits when confident about their businesses is accurate.\n\nHere are three other high-priced stocks that stand out as stock-split candidates.\n\nSeaboard Corp (SEB) a cargo ship in the middle of the ocean representing TOPS stock\n\nSource: VladSV / Shutterstock.com\n\nSeaboard Corp (NYSEAMERICAN:SEB) is a Kansas-based conglomerate that produces and processes hogs and pork processing in the U.S. Internationally, it focuses on commodity trading and grain processing in Africa and South America. Additionally, Seaboard provides cargo shipping services in the U.S., Caribbean, Central and South America, sugar and alcohol production in Argentina, and electric power generation in the Dominican Republic. It also has a 52.5% equity investment in Butterball, LLC, a producer and processor of turkey products.\n\nApproximately 73% of the company\u2019s shares are held by the Bresky family. Otto Bresky founded the company in 1921 when he acquired Rodney Milling Co. in Kansas City. As a result of the family\u2019s control position, the company\u2019s float is just 256,853 shares or 22% of its 1.16 million outstanding shares.\n\nSEB trades over\u00a0 $3,000 a share. A 30-to-1 stock split would increase the float to 7.7 million, allowing more investors to own a piece of the Butterball turkey and all the company\u2019s other holdings.\n\nIts shares have performed poorly in recent years. They\u2019re down 30% over the past five years. Seaboard could remedy this problem with a higher float.\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated (NYSE:COKE) is the largestCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) bottler in the U.S. It has operated for over 120 years. It currently distributes Coca-Cola products and those of its other partner companies across 14 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company was founded by J.B. Harrison in 1902. It is currently run by J. Frank Harrison III, J.B.\u2019s great-grandson. The Harrison family controls nearly 71% of the votes while Coca-Cola has 8.7% of the votes.\n\nThe company\u2019s float is 5.22 million, or 62% of its 8.4 million shares outstanding. Currently trading around $811, a 10-for-1 split would bring the share price below $100 while increasing the float to 52 million.\n\nThis past year was very good for profits. While revenues increased 7.3% in 2023 to $6.65 billion, on lower volumes, its operating income increased by 30.2% to $834.5 million, an operating margin of 12.5%, 220 basis points higher than a year earlier.\n\nYou\u2019ll also like the company\u2019s Christian values if you\u2019re a committed Christian. Its letter to shareholders states its purpose is \u201cTo honor God in all we do, to serve others, to pursue excellence, and to grow profitably.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not religious, but those are all worthy pursuits.\n\nFerrari (RACE) Ferarri car on the streets of France.\n\nSource: Hadrian / Shutterstock\n\nFerrari\u2019s (NYSE:RACE) stock is up 629% since it went public in Oct. 2015 at $52 a share.\n\nIn 2014, it had revenues of 2.76 billion euros from the shipment of 7,255 vehicles. Revenue was 5.97 billion euros ($6.35 billion) from 13.663 vehicles in 2023.\n\nIn early March, Citi analyst Harald Hendrikse downgraded Ferrari shares to sell from hold, citing valuation concerns, although he did raise his target price to $357, $67 below where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\n\u201c\u2018We cannot value Ferrari at \u20ac400,\u2019 wrote the analyst. \u2018While we like the quality and long-term growth prospects for Ferrari we are downgrading to a Sell on valuation,\u2019\u201d Barron\u2019s reported the analyst\u2019s comments.\n\nThe company\u2019s public float is 121.4 million shares, or approximately 63% of its 193.9 million shares outstanding.\n\nNot everyone can own a Ferrari, but everyone should be able to own shares of the iconic sports car company. An 8-for-1 stock split would reduce its share price to its 2015 IPO price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) Is Aiming To Keep Up Its Impressive Returns",
        "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So, when we ran our eye over Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE:CMG) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Chipotle Mexican Grill:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.23 = US$1.6b \u00f7 (US$8.0b - US$1.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThus, Chipotle Mexican Grill has an ROCE of 23%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Chipotle Mexican Grill's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Chipotle Mexican Grill .\n\nSo How Is Chipotle Mexican Grill's ROCE Trending?\n\nWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Chipotle Mexican Grill. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 23% and the business has deployed 286% more capital into its operations. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 23%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Chipotle Mexican Grill's ROCE\n\nIn short, we'd argue Chipotle Mexican Grill has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 322% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nLike most companies, Chipotle Mexican Grill does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is not the only stock earning high returns.

        "content": "Last month, Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) announced plans for a 50-for-1 stock split. Since the announcement, the fast-casual Mexican restaurant's stock has jumped 7% to an all-time high of about $3,000 per share.\n\nThose latest gains capped off a one-year surge of more than 70%. Given this strong rally and the excitement around the 50-for-1 split, let's dive into this business to see how investors should proceed with Chipotle stock.\n\nWhat's going on with Chipotle's stock split?\n\nIf approved at Chipotle's annual meeting on June 6, shareholders on record as of June 18 will receive an additional 49 shares for each share held after market close on June 25.\n\nThe stock split will increase the number of outstanding shares without changing the company's market capitalization. Think of the process like cutting a burrito into 50 smaller portions; while the overall size of the burrito remains unchanged, there are now more portions.\n\nWhile the stock split won't inherently change the value of Chipotle's business, it would bring current share prices down from nearly $3,000 to about $50. That makes it more approachable for retail investors, and with more people able to afford shares, demand for the stock could rise.\n\nChipotle is generating record revenue and profit\n\nAs for the business itself, Chipotle is putting up record financial results with $9.9 billion of revenue and $1.2 billion of net income for 2023, up 14.3% and 36.7%, respectively. Comparable sales increased 7.9% for the year, while restaurant-level operating margin jumped from 23.9% to 26.2%.\n\nPandemic-era initiatives continue to pay off for the company as well. Of the 271 new restaurants opened in 2023, 88% featured a Chipotlane drive-through. Digital orders\u00a0 made up 37.4% of revenue last year, and the company's rewards program topped 36 million members. For 2024, management expects comparable sales growth in the mid-single-digit range plus 285 to 315 new restaurant openings.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis leading restaurant chain still has room to grow\n\nChipotle started the year with 3,437 locations. While current guidance suggests the company could expand its locations 8% to 9% this year, management has also mentioned a long-term goal of more than doubling its store count to reach 7,000 restaurants in North America.\n\nThe company also believes average unit volumes can climb from their current $3 million to $4 million. Based on those long-term targets, annual revenue could reach $28 billion, or about 180% higher than last year's result.\n\nThanks to its strong balance sheet and rising cash flows, Chipotle can afford the investments to make management's long-term targets a reality as well. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs Chipotle a buy, sell, or hold?\n\nBefore purchasing any stock, even one firing on all cylinders like Chipotle, it's imperative to assess the company's valuation.\n\nAs of this writing, Chipotle trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67. That compares to a P/E ratio of just 25 for the S&P 500. While value investors may be shaking their heads at the thought of investing in any stock with a price tag as high as Chipotle's, its current valuation is roughly 14% lower than its five-year average of 78, despite the stock's strong gains in the past year.\n\nManagement has an attractive long-term vision and the track record to back it up. Investors willing to pay the premium should have a long-term mindset and stomach for volatility as a single earnings report that comes in below expectations could send the stock plunging.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Are you looking for non-tech stocks to buy that will do well and outperform the Magnificent Seven? Despite some of the top tech stocks not doing well in 2024, the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index is up nearly 19% year-to-date (YTD) and 73% over the past year. It\u2019s going to be tough to match that kind of firepower.\n\nAccording to Finviz.com, of the 503 stocks in the S&P 500, 79 are outperforming the Magnificent 7 in 2024. Of those, 63 are non-tech stocks. The three featured on this list come from different sectors, but all three were up over the past month, in addition to beating the index in 2024.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NASDAQ:CMG) represents the consumer discretionary sector. Its shares are up more than 12% over the past month and nearly 33% in 2024, outperforming the Magnificent 7.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe trouble with forecasting about stocks is that you\u2019re humbled a lot. Last November, I suggested that CMG stock was overbought when it was trading around $2,200. I didn\u2019t think it was worth buying until it was below $2,000. But it then went on a 32% run over the next four months.\n\nThe company is so confident of its future that it just announced it wants to do a 50-for-1 stock split. If approved by shareholders, it would be the first stock split for the Mexican fast-casual restaurant.\n\nChipotle\u2019s argument for dropping its share price to $60 from nearly $3,000 is first and foremost about making the shares more accessible to its employees. But it also become more affordable for other investors as well. That\u2019s a smart move to keep employees engaged and new investors buying.\n\n\u201cThis split comes at a time when our stock is experiencing an all-time high driven by record revenues, profits, and growth,\u201d CBS reported comments from Chipotle\u2019s chief financial and administrative officer, Jack Hartung.\n\nThis time, I\u2019m not betting against Chipotle. Neither should you if you\u2019re looking for non-tech stocks to buy.\n\nConstellation Energy (CEG) Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy.

Its shares are up more than 14% over the past month and 66% in 2024, more than three times the Magnificent 7.\n\nA funny thing happened on the way to a global surge in artificial intelligence (AI). The power demand went through the roof. Although Elon Musk might be controversial right now, he\u2019s no dummy. He recently stated that power shortages will happen due to this demand.\n\n\u201cNext year, you will see that they just can\u2019t find enough electricity to run all the chips,\u201d Barron\u2019sreported the billionaire\u2019s comments at the Bosch ConnectedWorld conference in February.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2020, data centers, which play a big part in AI computing, accounted for 2% of U.S. electricity consumption. By 2030, it could account for as much as 7.5%, a nearly four-fold increase.\n\nConstellation just happens to be one of North America\u2019s cleanest utilities. More than 90% of its annual output is carbon-free. It plans to get to 100% by 2040. Nuclear energy is a big reason for its audacious targets.\n\nThe utility\u2019s nuclear generation capacity is 22.1 gigawatts (GWs), more than 3 times Vistra Energy\u2019s (NYSE:VST) capacity of 6.3 GW. It also has the largest share of the commercial and industrial market at 21%, 500 basis points more than NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG).\n\nIt\u2019s clean, and it\u2019s safe.

Its shares are up nearly 5% over the past month and 23% in 2024.\n\nTrane\u2019s business is driven by three brands: Trane for commercial HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), Thermo King for transport refrigeration and Trane and American Standard for residential HVAC.\n\nApproximately 68% of its $17.7 billion in 2023 revenue was from equipment sales, while the remaining 32% came from aftermarket service. Since 2020, it\u2019s grown its revenue by 12% compounded annually, while its adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 260 basis points over the past three years to 18%.\n\nOver the past four years, it has deployed $9 billion in capital to all five capital allocation levers, with dividends and share repurchases leading the way.\n\nIn 2023, its share repurchases and dividends were $1.43 billion, down from over $1.8 billion a year earlier. That\u2019s because it spent $863 million on acquisitions, nearly 4 times what it spent in 2022.\n\nAll three of its geographic regions increased revenues and profits in 2023. For 2024, it expects 6-7% organic revenue growth, with earnings per share (EPS) of $10.15 at the midpoint of its guidance. That\u2019s 29.2x its current share price.\n\nLong-term, you will make money from this well-run business.

        "content": "A good stock can help you outperform the market and reach your financial goals sooner. While many investors seek to find a winning stock, it\u2019s best to diversify your holdings across numerous assets. This has led to this list of top stocks to buy.\n\nSpreading your money across multiple stocks minimizes your risk. You also have the opportunity to generate higher long-term returns. It\u2019s good to shop around for stocks even when you feel content with your portfolio. Always reviewing investment ideas allows you to capitalize on great deals when they arrive.\n\nInvestors can choose from thousands of publicly traded corporations. However, you may want to consider buying at least one of these seven top stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has entered a sharp correction ever since its competitor Ulta Beauty (NYSE:ULTA) warned investors about a slower beauty market. The recent pullback has resulted in a 46-forward P/E ratio for the cosmetics company.\n\nWhile some investors may feel nervous about the valuation, the reaction to Ulta news is overdone. The two beauty companies are in different leagues when it comes to growth rates. Ulta\u2019s revenue growth hovers at around 10% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Elf Beauty reported an 85% year-over-year increase in net sales and gained 305 basis points of market share in\u00a0Q3 FY24.\n\nElf Beauty has been maintaining 80% year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters while delivering impressive net income growth as well. The company also raised its fiscal 2024 outlook and achieved its 20th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nAnalysts have rated the stock as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d with a projected 30% upside. The stock has already been up by 92% over the past year. The correction presents a long-term buying opportunity, and it\u2019s possible for Elf Beauty to gain market share while others in the industry report slower sales. The second stock on this list follows that trend.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) An image of a hacker on a laptop with icons of messages and data behind him\n\nSource: jossnat / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that continues to grow at a solid rate while competitors are slamming the brakes and announcing lukewarm guidance. Crowdstrike previously declined in solidarity with other cybersecurity stocks as they reported unfavorable guidance. Investors had a change of heart after Crowdstrike reported a strong earnings report for Q4 FY24.\n\nRevenue grew by 33% year-over-year to reach $845.3 million. The company also has $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue which serves as a good baseline. It\u2019s getting easier for hackers to threaten companies. They can use artificial intelligence to brute force their way into unprotected databases. These tools are getting more advanced, and the Crowdstrike Falcon Platform offers good protection from cyberattacks. This makes it one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike has always delivered impressive revenue growth, but the company\u2019s rising profit margins are also stirring up excitement. The company reported $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year. The stock has gained 392% over the past five years.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Writing note showing Content Marketing. Business photo showcasing involves creation and sharing of online material.\n\nSource: Artur Szczybylo via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is a search engine marketing tool that helps businesses identify promising keywords. The first page of Google is prime real estate for online and local businesses. Those placements result in more website visitors who can turn into leads.\n\nCompetition in the industry is fierce, and Semrush gives many business owners the resources they need to succeed. Semrush is more than just keyword research. You can conduct detailed competitor analyses and discover opportunities to grow your business.\n\nThe stock has been bumpy since its IPO but is getting into the swing with a 31% gain over the past year. The company recently became profitable and reported an 8.5% net profit margin in\u00a0Q4 2023. That quarter also featured a 21% year-over-year revenue increase. Full-year net income came in at $1.0 million while the company generated $6.9 million in Q4 2023 net income.\n\nSemrush has approximately 108,000 paying customers which is a 12.5% year-over-year improvement. This broad customer pool can insulate the business from sharp revenue declines. Furthermore, some of the company\u2019s paying customers may upgrade their plans to access additional features.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a group of people eating fast food, including cheeseburgers and fries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is gaining market share in the fast food industry and continues to generate double-digit growth rates for its top and bottom lines. The fourth quarter of 2023 featured 15.4% year-over-year revenue growth and 26.1% year-over-year net income growth. Chipotle\u2019s net profit margin increased to 11.2%.\n\nThe company opened 121 restaurants in Q4 2023 and 271 new restaurants in the full year. Most of these restaurants include Chipotlanes, which allows the company to serve more customers. Chipotle has plans to open 285-315 restaurants in 2024 which is a 10.7% year-over-year improvement at the midpoint.\n\nChipotle stock will go through a\u00a050-for-1 stock split in June. The stock split will make shares more accessible and increase options trading volume. The stock has done a fine job of outperforming the stock market before its upcoming split. Shares are up by 308% over the past five years. It\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to win support from Wall Street analysts. Cloud computing, online marketplace sales, advertising, and video streaming are some of the catalysts that are prompting higher price targets.\n\nThe stock currently has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating and an average price target that suggests a 13% upside. Amazon only has Buy ratings from its 41 analysts. The highest price target of $230 per share suggests that the stock can rally by an additional 24%.\n\nAmazon is growing in multiple industries and recently reported its highest-ever revenue. Net sales increased by 14% year-over-year to reach $170 billion in\u00a0Q4 2023. North American and international sales accelerated in the fourth quarter, while Amazon Web Services revenue growth stayed in line for Q4 2023 compared to full-year 2023. All in all, it\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nThe segment had a 13% year-over-year growth rate for both time periods. Advertising services did even better with 27% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has outperformed the stock market with a 146% gain over the past year. Shares are also off to a hot start with a 52% year-to-date gain and come with a 34 P/E ratio.\n\nThe company\u2019s commitment to expanding profit margins can result in a more enticing valuation in the future. Meta Platforms more than tripled its net income in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue was 25% higher in the quarter compared to the same time last year.\n\nMeta Platforms don\u2019t only have good growth rates. It also has a healthy balance sheet. The social media firm has $65.40 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. On the other hand, it only has $18.39 billion in long-term debt. Meta Platforms reduced its headcount by 22% year-over-year to facilitate its profit margin expansion.\n\nMETA stock has now become a dividend growth play as the company recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The company will probably maintain an annualized growth rate above 10% for many years.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthy sports beverages that does not have ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, sugar, or gluten. The drink also contains essential vitamins and plenty of caffeine.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the stock and have rated it as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The stock has a projected 11% upside at the average price target. The highest price target of $110 per share implies that shares can rally by an additional 31% from current levels.\n\nThe company is growing at a fast rate and is gaining market share from its competitors. Celsius Holdings reported 95% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0Q4 2023. The sports beverage company generated $322.8 million of its $347.4 million in North America. International revenue grew by 68% year-over-year and is still in its early innings.\n\nThe company is on the verge of tapping into Australian and New Zealand markets. The beverages will reach the continent in\u00a0Q4 2024. Domestic sales remain elevated, and international traction can lead to high revenue growth for several years. The company has maintained double-digit profit margins while generating substantial top-line growth rates. All in all, it\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF, AMZN, and CELH.

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) closed at $2,926.96 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.16% move from the prior day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.15% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.02%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.32%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the Mexican food chain had gained 10.1% over the past month. This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.12% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.65% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Chipotle Mexican Grill in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on April 24, 2024. In that report, analysts expect Chipotle Mexican Grill to post earnings of $11.37 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 8.29%. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $2.66 billion, indicating a 12.31% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nCMG's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $53.12 per share and revenue of $11.22 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +18.41% and +13.65%, respectively.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Chipotle Mexican Grill. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.02% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. As of now, Chipotle Mexican Grill holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at its valuation, Chipotle Mexican Grill is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 55.19. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.52.\n\nAlso, we should mention that CMG has a PEG ratio of 2.51. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The average PEG ratio for the Retail - Restaurants industry stood at 1.81 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 147, which puts it in the bottom 42% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this Mexican food chain have returned +10.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which Chipotle belongs, has lost 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Chipotle is expected to post earnings of $11.37 per share, indicating a change of +8.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $53.12 points to a change of +18.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $64.63 indicates a change of +21.7% from what Chipotle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Chipotle is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Chipotle, the consensus sales estimate of $2.66 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.3%. The $11.22 billion and $12.64 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.7% and +12.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nChipotle reported revenues of $2.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.4%. EPS of $10.36 for the same period compares with $8.29 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.98%. The EPS surprise was +6.47%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nChipotle is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Chipotle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "When it comes to buying stocks, price matters. The prices of some stocks are so high that retail investors can\u2019t afford to buy a single share. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) recently announced a 50-for-1 stock split, the first split in the company\u2019s history, as its share price approaches $3,000. In announcing the split, Chipotle\u2019s management acknowledged that the share price had gotten beyond the reach of many investors. The stock split is scheduled to take place in June of this year.\n\nSimilarly, Warren Buffett created a second class of shares for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A,NYSE:BRK-B) because he didn\u2019t want to split the Class A stock that now trades at $637,389.06 per share. The company\u2019s Class B stock trades at 1/1,500th of the price of the Class A shares. The point is that while fundamentals and valuation matters, so too does the actual sticker price of a stock. Keeping the share price affordable to a wide range of investors helps to improve the liquidity of a security. Here are the three best under $50 stocks to buy in April 2024.\n\nLevi Strauss (LEVI) a stack of white t-shirts with the Levi's (LEVI) logo on them\n\nSource: Papin Lab / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the day of this writing, the stock of Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE:LEVI) is up 18% after the company reported financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. That said, shares of the company known for its blue jeans are still only trading at $22 a share and likely have more room to run. Even with the big post-earnings bounce, LEVI stock is only up 2% over the past five years. The company has struggled to reinvent its brand and bolster sales. But it now looks to have turned a corner.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLevi Strauss reported earnings per share (EPS) of 26 cents versus 21 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue for the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter exceeded the forecast of $1.56 billion, coming in at $1.56 billion. Analysts and investors particularly liked that Levi\u2019s said nearly half of all its sales are now coming from its own website and stores, relying less on wholesalers. Direct-to-consumer sales comprised a record 48% of Levi\u2019s total sales in the most recent quarter, boosting profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nLevi\u2019s now says that it wants direct-to-consumer sales to account for 55% of all sales. The company, which also raised its full-year guidance, has been working to diversify the products it sells, offering skirts, dresses, and shirts as well as blue jeans. Year to date, LEVI stock is up 36%.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt $23 a share, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is likely affordable for most investors. For the money, PLTR stock delivers big growth and exposure to the fast growing area of AI. So far in 2024, Palantir\u2019s share price has gained 40%. Over the last 12 months, the stock has increased 180%, beating the performance of most other tech companies. Driving the gains for shareholders has been profitability and the fact that the data analytics company is a big beneficiary of AI.\n\nFor the final three months of 2023, Palantir reported EPS of 8 cents, which matched Wall Street forecasts. Revenue of $608.4 million topped analysts\u2019 expectations for sales of $602.4 million. Sales were up 20% from a year earlier. The company\u2019s growth was attributed to demand for AI, which Palantir CEO Alex Karp has called \u201cunrelenting.\u201d Palantir has been rolling out a new AI platform and conducted 600 pilots of the technology in 2023, up from less than 100 in 2022.\n\nPalantir, known for its work with the U.S. government, said its commercial (private sector) revenue grew 70% year-over-year in Q4 2023. The company has now reported four consecutive quarters of profitability, making it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 index.\n\nUBS Group (UBS) UBS (UBS) bank sign on gray stone wall with red and gray logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Judith Linine\n\nIn banking, there is Swiss giant UBS Group (NYSE:UBS) whose shares currently trade at $31 each. Over the past year, UBS stock has risen 50% as the lender successfully integrates its former rival Credit Suisse and emerges as an even larger and stronger bank. Management at UBS has said they plan to complete the absorption of Credit Suisse by the end of the current second quarter. And they are already rewarding shareholders as the merger is finalized.\n\nUBS Group just announced a new $2 billion stock buyback program. The lender said that up to $1 billion of its buyback will occur this year. The new program follows the completion in March of UBS\u2019 previous stock buyback program that saw 8.62% of the lender\u2019s stock worth $5.2 billion repurchased over a two-year period. In announcing the new buyback program, UBS said: \u201cOur ambition is for share repurchases to exceed our pre-acquisition level by 2026.\u201d\n\nUBS, in addition to the buybacks, pays its shareholders a quarterly dividend of 35 cents a share, giving its stock a healthy yield of 2.14%. In February of this year, UBS raised its dividend payment by 25% after posting strong earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Chipotle Mexican Grill?\n\nAccording to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. We find that Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s ratio of 64.84x is above its peer average of 20.47x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Hospitality industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCan we expect growth from Chipotle Mexican Grill? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 71% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Chipotle Mexican Grill. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in CMG\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe CMG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CMG for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for CMG, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into Chipotle Mexican Grill, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

        "title": "Is Chipotle a Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity Ahead of Its 50-for-1 Stock Split?",
        "content": "When its 2023 fourth-quarter financials were released almost two months ago, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) announced results that easily beat Wall Street estimates. But in more recent times, shareholders are excited about a new development.\n\nOn March 19, the Tex-Mex restaurant chain announced a massive 50-for-1 stock split. Since then, shares have climbed about 4% (as of April 2), and they are up 27% this year. There's clearly strong investor interest in this stock right now, driving greater momentum.\n\nShareholders will vote on the stock split in June at the annual meeting. Does its pending approval make Chipotle a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity?\n\nCutting the burrito into smaller pieces\n\nIt's critical to first understand what exactly a stock split is. Typically, if a business's shares perform well, as has been the case with Chipotle, the price rises to an extremely high level. Executives want to reduce the price, so they announce a stock split. Lower nominal stock prices might be more enticing for smaller investors because they can acquire more whole shares, instead of having to buy fractional shares like some brokerages allow.\n\nShould this get approved, every shareholder will receive 49 new shares of Chipotle stock for every single one they already own. Consequently, there will be 50 times more outstanding shares that trade at 1/50th the price.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, nothing changes with Chipotle at a fundamental level. A stock split will not change management's strategy or alter revenue and earnings trajectories.\n\nIs Chipotle stock a buy?\n\nNow that we've established the specifics of Chipotle's stock split, it's time to turn our attention to the question of whether or not shares make for a smart buying opportunity right now. There are some important factors that we need to consider.\n\nThere's no doubt that the company continues firing on all cylinders. Chipotle reported revenue and earnings per share growth of 14.3% and 38.4%, respectively, in 2023. These two headline figures are significantly higher than they were just five years ago. Chipotle's results maintain strong financial performance despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey to the company's strategy, unsurprisingly, is aggressively opening new restaurants. There are currently 3,437 Chipotle locations (as of Dec. 31, 2023), up by 250 from 12 months before. The success of the drive-through setups, known as Chipotlanes, is noteworthy. Management points out that these locations increase new restaurant sales, margins, and returns. They also help strengthen Chipotle's digital presence.\n\nOver the long term, executives believe there can be 7,000 stores in North America, roughly double today's footprint. The hope is that these restaurants can generate $4 million in annual sales, up from $3 million in Q4. These forecasts certainly make bullish shareholders very happy.\n\nBut investors need to realize that just because a business is posting tremendous results and has bright growth prospects, it doesn't necessarily mean the stock is a no-brainer buy. Valuation is the missing ingredient that must be closely scrutinized.\n\nAfter shares have skyrocketed 311% in the past five years, Chipotle is extremely expensive today. The stock trades at a dizzying price-to-earnings ratio of 65.5. Even with impressive fundamentals and a lofty store opening target, the valuation is in nosebleed territory. There is literally no margin of safety for prospective investors, as Chipotle is priced for perfection right now.\n\nUndergoing a significant 50-for-1 stock split definitely grabs the attention of investors. However, that doesn't make Chipotle a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity. Investors shouldn't buy the stock right now. Instead, they should wait for a major pullback before even considering adding the business to their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Over the past year, many Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Customer & Technology Officer, Curtis Garner, for US$10.0m worth of shares, at about US$2,060 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$2,902, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 48% of Curtis Garner's holding.\n\nAll up, insiders sold more shares in Chipotle Mexican Grill than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Chipotle Mexican Grill. In total, insiders dumped US$4.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Chipotle Mexican Grill insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$547m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Chipotle Mexican Grill Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders haven't bought Chipotle Mexican Grill stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But since Chipotle Mexican Grill is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill you should know about.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

        "content": "Over half a million fast-food workers in California are getting a hefty pay raise thanks to the state\u2019s minimum-wage law that went into effect Monday.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the minimum-wage legislation into law last September, increasing wages from the state wage of $16, a 25% bump. Assembly Bill 1228, which applies to franchises with over 60 locations, has an exception for bakeries. Its passage also formed the Fast Food Council, which will establish rules and regulations for the industry.\n\nThe effects of the minimum-wage mandate will ripple outward to small business owners. California already has the country\u2019s highest unemployment rate\u20145.3%, compared to the national average of 3.9%\u2014and slow job growth will exert pressure on other sectors to make their pay more competitive.\n\n\u201cI think we are going to see spillover effects within food service, but beyond that, we should expect to see spillover effects to other industries that are competing for this talent,\u201d Daniel Zhao, lead economist for career site Glassdoor, told CNBC.\n\nThough about half a million workers will rejoice at a pay raise, the mandate has raised concerns about increased operating costs that could impact hours for workers and the price of menu items. Some fast-food franchisees don\u2019t believe California\u2019s new law is worth celebrating.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not a corporate store with deep pockets\u2019\n\nThe California law\u2019s passage means fast-food franchises will have to manage increased operating costs and strike a balance between raising prices and cutting workers.\n\nBrian Hom, who owns two locations of Vitality Bowls in San Jose, said the minimum-wage mandate will cost him $100,000 across both of his stores. To offset wage increases, he\u2019s increased store prices by 5%\u201310% and has stopped hiring new employees. Depending on the future of the business, he may consider cutting down shifts from three to four employees down to two\u2014or, if things get bad, laying off workers.\n\n\u201cI'm all for increasing wages,\u201d Hom said. \u201cBut I'm concerned with small businesses like myself being able to sustain keeping the business open.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nHom said his stores are not corporate, and that he employs his wife, sons, and daughter-in-law. He added that many owners are people of color and immigrants who poured money into their franchises for their livelihood.\n\n\u201cI invested substantial money out of my retirement funds to open new businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're not a corporate store with deep pockets.\u201d\n\nOther franchises have made similar concessions. Pizza Hut laid off over 1,000 delivery drivers ahead of the law\u2019s passage, but this was also due to industry change favoring transitions to third-party delivery services. Chipotle also intends to increase prices to offset increased operation costs.\n\n\"We know we have to take something as a significant increase when you talk about a 20%-ish increase in wages,\" Jack Hartung, Chipotle's chief financial and administrative officer, said in its fourth-quarter earnings presentation. \u201cWe haven't made a final decision, in terms of pricing. We'll wait and see just what the landscape looks like, what the consumer sentiment is, what other companies are going to do.\"\n\nLaurie Schalow, Chipotle's chief corporate affairs officer, told Business Insider that Chipotle anticipates a mid-single-digit price increase after the law\u2019s implementation.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve already developed this buffer\u2019\n\nAl\u00ed Bustamante, deputy director of Worker Power and Economic Security at the Roosevelt Institute, isn\u2019t convinced fast-food companies need to go through these concerted efforts to increase prices.\n\n\u201cCalifornia businesses can absorb this increase in the minimum wage without increasing prices and without having to impact employment in any kind of negative way,\u201d he said in a Monday press conference.\n\nFast-food companies have been marking up prices for about a decade, Bustamante argued, and doing so at a much higher rate than other industries. A March Roosevelt Institute report found fast-food prices increased 46.8% from 2014 to 2023, compared to a 28.7% average overall price increase of goods. The report also found that in 2023, the 10 largest publicly traded fast-food companies spent $6.1 billion on share buyback to return money to investors. Roosevelt Institute calculated the cost to increase wages for all fast-food workers in the state would be, at a maximum, $4.6 billion.\n\nThe minimum-wage bump likely won\u2019t be as dramatic as fast-food companies think: Minimum wage in some California cities is already higher than the state-mandated $16. The minimum wage in Los Angeles is $16.90 per hour; in San Francisco, it\u2019s $18.07. This means many workers in those parts of the state won\u2019t experience the 25% wage hike. According to the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California at Berkeley, about one-third of minimum-wage jobs in California are already earning more than the state\u2019s $16 per hour.\n\nNot only will the law not impact fast-food companies to the full expected extent, Bustamante said, but fast-food companies are already adept at increasing profit margins, making it unnecessary for them to take additional measures to pass off increased operating costs to their employees.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already developed this buffer,\u201d Bustamante said. \u201cThey\u2019ve already basically developed these unnecessary price hikes in the past that allow them to now either be able to actually absorb higher operating costs without actually necessitating increases in prices or impacting labor in any negative way.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Is the stock market getting too euphoric? It\u2019s clear that the indexes are on fire right now, and the gains seem effortless as the markets keep notching new highs.\n\nHowever, sentiment may be getting out of hand. One popular measure of sentiment, CNN\u2018s Fear and Greed Index, has pushed into extreme readings in recent weeks. It measures a variety of different indicators, with factors like \u201cstock price strength\u201d and \u201cmarket momentum\u201d sitting at \u201cextreme greed\u201d ratings right now, though a couple of other metrics are still at \u201cgreed\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d respectively. In any case, sentiment is getting exceptionally bullish.\n\nHistorically, extreme greed readouts have often been followed by meaningful corrections. While the bull run may continue for quite a while, we should expect at least some pauses if not major pullbacks along the way.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd for these three stocks to sell in particular, valuations have reached unbelievably lofty highs, setting up the possibility of dramatic declines in the weeks and months to come.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nApparently, the sky isn\u2019t the limit for a Mexican food-themed restaurant company. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) shares are getting spicy, with the stock up more than 75% over the past year.\n\nHowever, Chipotle is also turning into a perfect example of what investor greed may look like. Chipotle has been fueled by Reddit traders that are seeking fast gains from powerful momentum stocks. So far, that has been working, especially after Chipotle just announced a mouth-watering 50-for-1 stock split.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to see how this growth will last. Chipotle is already becoming a saturated restaurant concept in the United States, and there is much less proof about how much legs the concept will have internationally.\n\nMeanwhile, with the recent run-up, CMG stock is now selling for more than 50 times forward earnings. Chipotle makes great-tasting food, but that doesn\u2019t make the stock an appetizing buy after this exponential run-up.\n\nStory continues\n\nCostco (COST) Costco logo on a sign on a Costco store.\n\nSource: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) is the perfect example of a wonderful business that has been driven to an absurd price thanks to the market\u2019s unrelenting rally.\n\nCOST stock has soared more than 50% over the past year. This has driven the retailer\u2019s P/E multiple up to around 50. That\u2019s an unbelievable number for a lower-margin business such as this one where analysts see just 5 to 7% top-line growth annually in coming years.\n\nCostco has a tremendous business model, based on its club membership model. There\u2019s little disputing that. But at the end of the day, the company sells groceries and other essential goods, and these sorts of firms usually don\u2019t sell at sky-high multiples. The threat of e-commerce disruption to the business model also lingers.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that Costco\u2019s true valuation has really grown by more than half over the past year. More likely, COST stock has run far ahead of its underlying fundamentals. And the sell-off following the company\u2019s recent underwhelming earnings report could be just the start of a much bigger decline.\n\nFerrari (RACE) Ferarri car on the streets of France.\n\nSource: Hadrian / Shutterstock\n\nFerrari (NYSE:RACE) has been outpacing the competition in the automotive space. RACE stock is already up 30% year-to-date and has sprinted 65% higher over the past 12 months. That has been a particularly strong showing given the weakness in formerly popular electric vehicle stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) over the same time period.\n\nFerrari appears to be winning because of its appeal to the true luxury class. Most Ferraris tend to have a starting sale price of $300,000 or up. That puts them into a different socioeconomic level than the sorts of more affordable upscale vehicles that might be priced in high five or low six figures.\n\nThe world\u2019s rich have done well since the pandemic, as rising asset prices have led to a strong wealth effect. Put another way, the global elites are spending money at a record pace, and thus sales of yachts, handbags and luxury vehicles like Ferrari and Lamborghini have spiked.\n\nThis sort of outsized growth is unlikely to continue indefinitely, however. And meanwhile, investors are extrapolating Ferrari\u2019s recent growth dramatically. In fact, traders have pushed Ferrari\u2019s P/E ratio up to more than 50 times. That\u2019s an awfully lofty ratio for an automobile company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has 70% of His $10 Billion Portfolio in Just 4 Stocks",
        "content": "For individual investors, it can pay to follow what the professionals are doing. Specifically, if you are a buy-and-hold investor you can find ideas from like-minded investing legends. One investor to follow closely is Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management. The billionaire investor runs a $10 billion portfolio for outside investors, owning positions in just seven stocks that he and the team have held for many years.\n\nHere are four stocks that make up a whopping 70% of Ackman's concentrated stock portfolio. CMG Operating Income (TTM) Chart\n\n1. Successfully betting on a Chipotle rebound\n\nAckman's second-largest position is Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Pershing Square bought the stock after the restaurant chain began to struggle in 2016 after an outbreak of food-borne illness at some of its locations. It helped the company steer a turnaround by bringing in new management and fixing its quality control issues.\n\nSince the middle of 2016, Chipotle's stock has returned some 632% for shareholders. Operating income has grown even faster, up 963% over this time period as the company regained store traffic and significantly improved its margins. At the end of 2023, it had just under 3,500 stores in North America. While the company is quite large today, management thinks there is room to double its store count to 7,000 locations in North America alone, with no consideration for any international expansion.\n\nAdd on solid same-store sales growth, and Chipotle looks primed to continue growing earnings for many years into the future. At just over 18% of his portfolio, this has been a huge winner for Ackman and could continue to be in the future. QSR EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\n2. More restaurant exposure\n\nAt 17.6% of the portfolio, another large position for Pershing Square is Restaurant Brands International(NYSE: QSR). Like Chipotle, this is a bet on quick-service restaurant chains, with the company owning four brands: Firehouse Subs, Popeyes, Burger King, and Tim Hortons. It has also been one of the longer-term holdings for Pershing Square, with the first purchase of the stock coming all the way back in 2014.\n\nStory continues\n\nRestaurant Brands' stock performance has not been as strong as Chipotle's, but it has still done well for Pershing Square. Shares are up 194% since 2014, with earnings per share (EPS) up 654% as well. It owns four distinct brands that give it diversified exposure to the entire restaurant sector with over 30,000 restaurants spread around the globe. For investors looking for durable stocks with low downside over the long term, Restaurant Brands International looks like a great choice. It is hard to imagine there not being Burger King and Tim Hortons locations 10 or 20 years from now. HLT Operating Income (TTM) Chart\n\n3. A take rate on global travel\n\nAt 16.2% of the Pershing Square stock portfolio, Ackman has made another play on a consumer brand with Hilton Worldwide Holdings(NYSE: HLT). The investment company bought the stock back in 2018, making a bet on the growth of global travel. Hilton Worldwide owns its namesake Hilton brand but also a variety of other hotel brands like the Waldorf Astoria, Embassy Suites, and DoubleTree.\n\nImportantly, Hilton Worldwide doesn't actually own the hotel real estate, but licenses its brands to hotel operators. In exchange, Hilton receives a cut of all sales, which hotel owners are willing to do because the Hilton brand allows them to offer higher room rates compared to if they were an independent operator.\n\nHilton's earnings haven't grown much since 2018 due to the pandemic, with operating income up 77% and revenue only up 20%. But it looks like a recovery may be on the way, with spending on travel fully rebounding in most markets. With its exposure to global travel, Hilton is poised to benefit from this recovery, and its business model is hedged to inflation. It is unsurprising then to see the stock make up a large portion of Ackman's portfolio in early 2024. This is a great business with a long-standing global brand.\n\n4. Don't forget the largest holding: Alphabet\n\nAckman's largest holding, and his most recent purchase, is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Pershing Square bought shares of the parent company of Google Search and YouTube in early 2023. It is now close to 19% of the stock portfolio.\n\nAckman likely purchased Alphabet because of its falling valuation at the beginning of last year due to fears it was losing the new race in artificial intelligence (AI) to competitors like Microsoft. These fears proved to be unwarranted, with Alphabet continuing its earnings growth through 2023. The company's operating earnings hit an all-time high of $84.3 billion in 2023, leading the stock to soar 71% since the beginning of last year.\n\nAlphabet looks like a quintessential Pershing Square bet. It is a diversified holding company with long-standing global brands, and the hedge fund manager decided to strike and make it a large position when its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) came down to around 15 early last year.\n\nInvestors can learn a lot from Pershing Square and Ackman. He makes concentrated bets on stocks with strong brands trading at reasonable valuations. Then, he holds his positions for many years and lets his winners run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Q4 Earnings Roundup: Noodles (NASDAQ:NDLS) And The Rest Of The Modern Fast Food Segment\n\nThe end of an earnings season can be a great time to assess how companies are handling the current business environment and discover new stocks. Let\u2019s take a look at how Noodles (NASDAQ:NDLS) and the rest of the modern fast food stocks fared in Q4.\n\nModern fast food is a relatively newer category representing a middle ground between traditional fast food and sit-down restaurants. These establishments feature an expanded menu selection priced above traditional fast food options, often incorporating fresher and cleaner ingredients to serve customers prioritizing quality. These eateries are capitalizing on the perception that your drive-through burger and fries joint is detrimental to your health because of inferior ingredients.\n\nThe 6 modern fast food stocks we track reported a strong Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.6% while next quarter's revenue guidance was 2.8% above consensus. Stocks have been under pressure as inflation (despite slowing) makes their long-dated profits less valuable, but modern fast food stocks held their ground better than others, with the share prices up 22.4% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nWeakest Q4: Noodles (NASDAQ:NDLS)\n\nOffering pasta, mac and cheese, pad thai, and more, Noodles & Company (NASDAQ:NDLS) is a casual restaurant chain that serves all manner of noodles from around the world.\n\nNoodles reported revenues of $124.3 million, down 8.9% year on year, falling short of analyst expectations by 0.8%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with full-year revenue guidance missing analysts' expectations. Noodles Total Revenue\n\nNoodles delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates, slowest revenue growth, and weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. The stock is down 19.8% since the results and currently trades at $1.97.\n\nRead our full report on Noodles here, it's free.\n\nBest Q4: Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK)\n\nStarted as a hot dog cart in New York City's Madison Square Park, Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) is a fast-food restaurant known for its burgers and milkshakes.\n\nStory continues\n\nShake Shack reported revenues of $286.2 million, up 20% year on year, outperforming analyst expectations by 2.2%. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with an impressive beat across the board on all key metrics from sale-store sales to revenue to profits to EPS. FCF even came in higher than expected and was positive rather than the loss projected by Wall Street analysts. Shake Shack Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is up 33.7% since the results and currently trades at $104.24.\n\nIs now the time to buy Shake Shack? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nPotbelly (NASDAQ:PBPB)\n\nWith a unique origin story where the company actually started as an antique shop, Potbelly (NASDAQ:PBPB) today is a chain known for its toasty sandwiches.\n\nPotbelly reported revenues of $125.7 million, up 4.7% year on year, in line with analyst expectations. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' gross margin estimates but a miss of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nThe stock is down 8.2% since the results and currently trades at $12.38.\n\nRead our full analysis of Potbelly's results here.\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG)\n\nBorn from a desire to offer quick meals with fresh, flavorful ingredients, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a fast-food chain known for its healthy, Mexican-inspired cuisine and customizable dishes.\n\nChipotle reported revenues of $2.52 billion, up 15.4% year on year, surpassing analyst expectations by 1.1%.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has 37% of His Portfolio Invested in 2 Brilliant Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire Bill Ackman manages the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management. He achieved a total return of 212% during the five-year period that ended in February 2024, easily outperforming the S&P 500, which increased 99% during the same period. That makes him a good case study for aspiring investors.\n\nWith that in mind, Ackman had 37% of his $10.4 billion portfolio split between two companies as of the December quarter. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) accounted for 19% of his invested assets, and Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) accounted for 18%. That position sizing screams high conviction.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these two brilliantly successful companies.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet reported solid results in the fourth quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Total revenue increased 13% to $86.3 billion on particularly strong sales growth in the cloud computing segment. Meanwhile, GAAP net income soared 52% to $20.7 billion as cost control efforts led to a 300-basis-point expansion in operating margin. Investors can expect similar revenue growth in the coming quarters, though earnings growth will undoubtedly slow.\n\nAlphabet subsidiary Google has a durable competitive advantage in its ability to source data from across the internet. Specifically, the company owns 15 products that serve at least 500 million users, and six products that serve more than 2 billion users. That includes internet search engine Google Search, streaming platform YouTube, the Android mobile operating system, and the Chrome web browser.\n\nThe upshot is that Google dominates the digital advertising market because it has a deep understanding of consumer behavior that media buyers find valuable. The company accounted for 39% of digital ad spending last year, according to Statista. Google is working to strengthen its position by infusing its ad tech ecosystem with new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, including the recent addition of generative AI capabilities to Google Search.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet has steadily gained share in cloud computing due to investments in product development and go-to-market capabilities. Google Cloud Platform accounted for 11% of cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue in the fourth quarter, up one percentage point from the prior year. Google still trails Amazon and Microsoft by a wide margin, but the recent release of Gemini could help the company gain more market share.\n\nGemini is a machine learning model that can outperform GPT-4 (the engine behind ChatGPT Plus) across a range of benchmarks, according to the company. Gemini lets Google Cloud customers build AI applications, such as conversational chatbots and intelligence search agents. Gemini also integrates with Google Workspace applications to automate tasks like drafting content in Google Docs, synthesizing data in Google Sheets, and generating images in Google Slides.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Alphabet to grow sales by 10% annually over the next five years, but that estimate leaves upside if the company merely maintains its market share in advertising and cloud computing. I say that because digital ad spending is expected to grow at 15% annually through 2030, and cloud computing revenue is expected to grow at 14% annually during the same period.\n\nHowever, the current valuation of 6.4 times sales look reasonable even if the Wall Street consensus is correct. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying this growth stock today, but I would be much more conservative on position sizing than Bill Ackman.\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle looked strong in the fourth quarter despite a challenging environment for many peers in the restaurant industry. Revenue for the fast-casual restaurant chain increased 15% to $2.5 billion, operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 14.4%, and non-GAAP net income soared 25% to $10.36 per diluted share. The driving force behind that success was strong same-store sales growth of 8.4% driven by pricing power and a 7.4% increase in foot traffic.\n\nThose numbers are truly impressive in context. The average restaurant saw same-store sales increase just 1.1% in December, while customer traffic actually declined 1.7%, according to the National Restaurant Association. That means Chipotle brought more people in the door while the average competitor lost business, something the company does on a regular basis. That is a testament to the brand authority Chipotle has cultivated through its \"food with integrity\" strategy.\n\nTo elaborate, Chipotle sources only responsibly raised meats (no hormones or antibiotics) and organically grown produce, and it uses only real ingredients (no preservatives or artificial flavors). The company is also committed to fresh ingredients, which means no freezers, no can openers, and no microwaves, according to CEO Brian Niccol. That strategy has helped Chipotle separate itself from other quick-service restaurants.\n\nUnfortunately, not every brilliant company also qualifies as a great investment. Wall Street expects Chipotle to grow earnings per share at 20% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 65 times earnings look rather expensive. To be fair, investors that want a piece of this company should be prepared to pay a premium, but I would personally wait for a cheaper entry point before purchasing shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Chipotle Has 1 of the Biggest Stock Splits in New York Stock Exchange History. Here's Why I'm Still Not Buying It.",
        "content": "Fast food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) recently announced one of the largest stock splits in the New York Stock Exchange's history. The company's shares will be sliced up 50-to-1, resetting the stock's share price to roughly $57 per share. The split will go into effect in a few months.\n\nBy some measures, the stock split is already a smashing success. Chipotle's stock has been up since the announcement. However, I'm standing happily on the sidelines. Here is why I'm not buying Chipotle's monumental stock split.\n\nUnderstanding what stock splits do\n\nInvestors love stock splits, and company employees love stock splits. Why is that? Well, it's for different reasons. A stock split lowers a stock's share price by proportionately increasing the number of outstanding shares. In other words, Chipotle's current share price of $2,880 will be divided by 50, and the quantity of shares will increase 50-fold.\n\nUltimately, it's all about liquidity. Investors like lower share prices because they make it easier to accumulate shares of the stock. Employees like lower share prices because they make selling the equity they've acquired working for the company easier. A Chipotle employee might not want to sell their equity in nearly $3,000 chunks.\n\nImportantly, the split doesn't impact the company's fundamental valuation. Earnings and other per-share financials are split, too. If you cut a cake once for two people and again for four, everyone gets a smaller piece. No matter how many times you cut it up, the cake stays the same size.\n\nA spicy stock, no matter how you slice it\n\nIt's not that Chipotle isn't a good investment. The stock has outperformed the broader market since going public. My problem lies with how much Wall Street demands investors pay to own shares. Today, Chipotle trades at a forward P/E of 54.\n\nThat's a high valuation. Interestingly, though, Chipotle's growth outlook is nearly as impressive. Analysts believe earnings will compound at 20% over the long term as the company opens new stores and repurchases shares. Repurchases have retired nearly 12% of shares over the past decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are still just 3,437 Chipotle locations today, compared to nearly 8,000 Taco Bell locations in America. Considering Chipotle started in 1993, that growth formula could go on for many years without running out of runway.\n\nThis combination of store expansion and steady share repurchases puts a solid floor under Chipotle's long-term earnings growth. Unless people suddenly hate Chipotle, there's a good chance the company's making more profits five years, 10 years, or 25 years from now. CMG PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nBut 54 times earnings is too expensive, even for such durable growth. I like using the PEG ratio to double-check my logic before buying stocks. It shows you how much you pay for the company's earnings growth. I look for a PEG ratio under 1.5, and Chipotle's is 2.7, which is almost double. So it's not that Chipotle is a tad expensive -- it's unreasonably expensive.\n\nWhat price should investors stomach?\n\nRemember, a company can be amazing, but the stock won't be if you dramatically overpay to own it. Over time, expensive stocks almost always revert to a more appropriate valuation. The share price either falls or stagnates while earnings grow and catch up. Chipotle will probably do the same thing in the future. Be patient and consider waiting for a better buying opportunity.\n\nPredicting a stock's short-term performance is impossible, but investors can set up hypothetical price ranges at which buying would make more sense. For Chipotle, the stock would need to grow earnings by 20% annually and trade at 30 times earnings to generate that 1.5 PEG ratio I am looking for now.\n\nAnalysts expect Chipotle to earn $53 per share this year, making the stock a buy at 30 times those earnings, or $1,590 or less.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "If You Like Chipotle and Its Stock Split, Then You'll Love These 2 Dividend Stocks",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) captured the spotlight recently with its announcement that it will issue a 50-for-1 stock split. The makes sense given that the stock recently achieved a new all-time high of over $3,000 a share (before slipping back slightly).\n\nHere's why Chipotle and two other leading restaurant, food, and beverage dividend stocks are all worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nChipotle is an excellent story with room to run\n\nChipotle has growth -- plain and simple. Its top line continues to grow at a breakneck pace, but it's the company's margins that have really improved in recent years. Chipotle now has roughly the same operating margin as Starbucks but is growing at a far faster rate.\n\nHowever, unlike other restaurant chains, Chipotle doesn't pay a dividend because it prefers to pour profits back into the business. This bold strategy can amplify gains, but it also puts pressure on the investment thesis when there's a slowdown. CMG Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWhat's more, Chipotle is a very expensive stock -- especially for its size and industry. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 66. Granted, the forward P/E is a bit lower at about 55.\n\nAnalysts' consensus estimates call for $64.78 in fiscal 2025 earnings per share (pre-split) -- which would imply 21% growth compared to fiscal 2024 expectations of $53.45 per share.\n\nIf Chipotle keeps growing its bottom line by 15% to 20% per year, then its expensive valuation could start to look much more reasonable over time. But there's no denying the stock is priced to perfection and should only be considered by investors who believe in the company's sustained growth and have a multi-year outlook.\n\nMcDonald's has a near-perfect business model\n\nChipotle isn't a terrible buy, but McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) could be even better. For one, investors are getting the chance to buy McDonald's at a 24.5 P/E, a discount to its five-year median P/E of 27.1.\n\nMcDonald's has been raising its dividend at a fairly rapid rate. The current quarterly dividend is $1.67 --\u00a0 roughly double what it was 10 years ago. In October, McDonald's raised its dividend by 10%, which is a sizable increase for a company of its size. The raise puts McDonald's on track to become a Dividend King by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's has an underrated business model. Unlike Chipotle, which owns and operates all its U.S. locations, 95% of McDonald's locations worldwide are franchised. McDonald's owns the real estate and collects rent revenue, royalties, franchise fees, and more. The company's structure makes its brand and the perceived revenue that franchisees can generate over time more important than its short-term performance or even the business cycle. MCD Shares Outstanding Chart\n\nMcDonald's may not have Chipotle's growth, but it's a better investment if you're looking for consistency. The company has an extensive track record of rewarding its shareholders. As mentioned, the dividend has roughly doubled over the last decade, but it's the entire capital return program that really stands out.\n\nOver the last decade, McDonald's has bought back over a quarter of its outstanding shares, which illustrates the effectiveness of its business model and how it rewards shareholders using dividends and buybacks on top of potential capital gains.\n\nIn sum, McDonald's has it all, and is worth buying now.\n\nCoke offers a compelling, reliable yield\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) hasn't bought back shares at nearly the rate as McDonald's. And it doesn't have as good growth prospects as Chipotle or McDonald's. However, what Coke has is stability and the ever-important quality of not overextending itself.\n\nCoke was instrumental in globalizing soda. But today, the company is mature. There's only so much it can do to grow without overspending. To its credit, it has made measured and mostly effective acquisitions. It has also stayed almost entirely within its core competency of nonalcoholic beverages, which is far different from a company like PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats, and plenty of other brands across product categories.\n\nWhen the market has a bad year, Coke tends to outperform. But when the market has a great year, Coke usually underperforms. Unsurprisingly, Coke has underperformed because the market has done very well in recent years.\n\nThe ideal way to invest in Coke isn't because you're trying to beat the market, but because you want to limit downside risk and collect passive income. Nothing is guaranteed in the stock market, but Coke is about as close as it gets to predictability. The company has raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years.\n\nThe stock yields 3.2% -- which is quite a bit higher than other reliable Dividend Kings. Coke's reliability is one of the reasons why Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway has owned the stock for over 30 years.\n\nSomething for everyone\n\nIt's easy to get enamored with a growth story like Chipotle, especially when the entry point (without fractional shares) becomes lower, thanks to a stock split. However, to have the conviction to hold a stock over time, it's essential to invest in companies you understand and that align with your investment objectives.\n\nChipotle's lack of a dividend and its lofty valuation won't appeal to everyone. If you're more income and value oriented, McDonald's and Coke could be better choices.\n\nBut if you're a balanced investor, then picking up shares of all three stocks is a great way to get a bit of growth, value, and income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Q&amp;A: Chipotle CEO dishes on big portion sizes, AI, and top leadership advice",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nJust passing the six-year mark in his run as Chipotle's (CMG) CEO, Brian Niccol is still juggling full plates.\n\nOn his mind: robots that cut, core, and peel avocados; a coming commencement speech at his alma mater; and how many restaurants he's opening in the years ahead.\n\nAll in the day of a CEO who has flown a little under the radar in the press, but not with his investor base. This week, the company announced a 50-for-one stock split, making its shares more accessible as the stock trades around all-time highs.\n\n\"I think Chipotle is going to achieve things that we set out in vision statements and now we're making reality \u2014 so the next few years are going to be a lot of fun,\" Niccol tells Yahoo Finance.\n\nIt's been a fun few decades for Niccol, who got his feet wet at Procter & Gamble (PG)'s branding department in the mid-1990s. Then a recent college graduate, one of his first assignments was working on P&G's Scope Mouthwash account and reportedly breaking new ground by sending an animated kiss via email.\n\nFast-forward, and Niccol was leading marketing at Yum! Brands (YUM) owned Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, where he created Taco Bell's famed \"Live M\u00e1s\" branding. He went on to become its CEO, his last role before accepting the Chipotle gig. Brian Niccol speaks during an interview at the Associated Press in New York. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe soft-spoken fast food veteran started as Chipotle's CEO on March 5, 2018, with two strategic imperatives. First, stabilize a business financially rocked by an E.Coli outbreak. Second, relaunch the brand amid a shift to digital ordering.\n\nThen, another priority as the COVID-19 pandemic hit: Retrain workers and continue to promote from within, long the hallmark of Chipotle.\n\nSince then, Niccol has checked every box and more. He ushered in new menu items such as cauliflower rice and quesadillas, and tested robots that make tortilla chips. He boosted Chipotle's presence to 3,400 locations (including an entry into Canada), up from 2,400 around the time he was hired.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chain could hit 7,000 restaurants or more in the US over the next decade, says Niccol, who's aiming for a record of 285 to 315 new openings in 2024.\n\nChipotle shares have skyrocketed 556% since Niccol was announced as CEO, per Yahoo Finance data, compared to 89% for the S&P 500 and 79% for McDonald's (MCD).\n\nTo further put this into perspective, Apple's (AAPL) stock price is up 275% during that time span, while Amazon (AMZN) has gained about 119%.\n\n\"Chipotle remains a premium brand with strong value and digital capabilities that have positioned Co better than most as evidenced in recent traffic trends,\" Jefferies analyst Andy Barish said in a recent client note.\n\nThe below conversation with Niccol has been condensed for length and clarity.\n\nBrian Sozzi: Through the inflationary period seen in recent years for fast food, people have still seemed to have a love affair with Chipotle the brand. Why?\n\nBrian Niccol: The mission that we have is \"Food with Integrity.\" And what does that mean? Well, it means clean food. It means food that's raised the right way. It means it's food that's cooked and prepared the right way.\n\n[Customers will] talk about how big the portions are with the burritos or the bowls that they build, but when you really boil it down, it is this commitment to Food with Integrity and the [cooking] that actually happens in our restaurants. It's all fresh food done right in front of you, and people are turned on by that, and the fact that we can get it done highly customized and highly fast, it's just meaningful bonus points.\n\nSozzi: It's really just the large portion size, come on.\n\nNiccol: Well, I think you hit the nail on the head, Brian. The customization so that you can get the bowl or the burrito the way you want \u2014 it is hugely valuable. If you want double meat, we'll do that for you. If you want a little extra rice, we'll do that for you. At the end of the day, however you want to eat, you ultimately feel good about what you're putting in your body. And I think that matters a lot to every generation and every income cohort out there.\n\nSozzi: How is AI and new automation technology going to change Chipotle's future? A new JP Morgan report said you were testing cameras that will help measure portion sizes so they are accurate; tell us more.\n\nNiccol: I think there's definitely a future where we can be a lot more accurate in giving people consistent portion sizes, whether it's double guac on the side or in your bowl. And the reality is between vision, technology, and AI, I think we're going to be able to become a lot more accurate, without having to give up any speed in doing it. That's what I'm most excited about.\n\nSozzi: Is this the year where you test new vision technology in restaurants to improve order accuracy?\n\nNiccol: We have not yet, but I'm optimistic that this is the year where we're going to do one or two of these things at least in a restaurant. And the thing that I'm really excited about is even the next generation [of this technology] that we're already working on.\n\nAnd then when you get your crew members involved, you put it under the pressure of hundreds of transactions, you just learn so much. I think even on our Autocado [avocado peeling robots], we're already on like our third or fourth prototype, and now we're like okay, this is ready to go into a restaurant. I'm sure when we put it in the restaurant, we'll learn something that might cause us to iterate one more time.\n\nPart of the process of this too is you've got to be comfortable with failing. Chippy [tortilla chip-making robot] didn't pan out the way we thought it would. Because of Chippy we ended up a lot better on Autocado. I'm committed to being a learning organization.\n\nSozzi: What went wrong with the Chippy robot testing?\n\nNiccol: The biggest challenge was the cleaning of it. It just became way too cumbersome for the team to clean it. We took that learning for Autocado. Much earlier in the design we have to take into account what's going to take for the crew member to clean this thing. The time is nearing where a machine could cut, core and peel avocados at Chipotle restaurants. (Chipotle)\n\nSozzi: The Chipotle lines in the restaurant feel like they are moving faster at long last. Why?\n\nNiccol: [It] is just from getting back to executing on Chipotle standards. We had to really shake off some of the behaviors that were created during the labor shortage in COVID. Where we were dealt really difficult situations that caused them to close the restaurant early or be out of ingredients or be understaffed.\n\nAnd all that stuff now is behind us. We're staffed now and trained for deploying, and the teams have more stability than they've had in the last couple of years.\n\nSozzi: Not many restaurant chains are opening 300 locations this year as you all are. In 10 years, how many Chipotles are open worldwide?\n\nNiccol: Well, we've publicly said we want at least to get to 7,000. I think the good news is as we continue to open restaurants we see no slowing down in new unit economics, which will give us more and more confidence that 7,000 might be too conservative of a number.\n\nAnd I'm just talking about the US. So, Canada is performing well, every region in the United States is performing well, and we're early days in Europe, and we're going to start exploring how this brand can work and travel outside the United States. But it's early days there.\n\nSozzi: Can Chipotle work in China?\n\nNiccol: That's a great question. I don't know the answer to that yet. My instincts tell me yes. But we have a long way to go to prove that out ... The good news is, we've got the US business growing in a really special way that affords us the opportunity to go learn in a lot of different parts of the world.\n\nSozzi: Chipotle continues to place a lot of emphasis on promoting people from within to higher-level positions and offering perks like college assistance to strengthen the culture. How much do you think about culture each day?\n\nNiccol: It's hugely important. People want to be a part of a winning culture, a caring culture, a growing culture. And one of my key jobs is how do I make sure I've got the right leaders that cascade that type of culture.\n\nSozzi: How do you stay sharp as a leader?\n\nNiccol: I'm always trying to figure out what I could learn next. I'm still really curious. I like what I do. So that gets me energized. And it's fun when you're a part of growing something. The idea that we have so much opportunity to grow, and the fact that I still consider myself young, I still have so much I personally think I could impact and grow myself.\n\nSozzi: So where do you see yourself in 10 years? You are still a young guy as you mentioned.\n\nNiccol: It's funny, I've got three kids and my youngest, she's still in middle school. I want obviously Chipotle to achieve everything that we've set out to do. But I also know it's important for me and my wife Jen to see our kids turn into good folks. And, hopefully over the next 10 years, that's what we see happen with our kids. I want to see them turn into brave young adults. And at the same time, I think Chipotle is going to achieve things that we set out in vision statements and now we're making [them] reality. Brian Niccol quote\n\nSozzi: I hear you are giving a commencement speech in May to your alma mater Miami University. What's your message going to be to those graduating?\n\nNiccol: It's funny, I'm working on that right now. People that are committed to getting things done, guess what, they get things done. And then unexpected things happen. Unexpected doors open, unexpected opportunities open. And when you walk through those things with an attitude of I'm going to get it done, things happen.\n\nYou've got to do it with high integrity, you've got to do it with high resilience, because not everything's going to go the way you think. I think we live in one of the best places in the world to take advantage of that. So, I think that's the biggest thing that people need to remember is don't be afraid to be a doer.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Is Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.'s (NYSE:CMG) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE:CMG) stock is up by a considerable 25% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Chipotle Mexican Grill's  ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Chipotle Mexican Grill is:\n\n40% = US$1.2b \u00f7 US$3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.40 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's Earnings Growth And 40% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Chipotle Mexican Grill has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 18% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, Chipotle Mexican Grill's considerable five year net income growth of 36% was to be expected.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a next step, we compared Chipotle Mexican Grill's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 22%. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Chipotle Mexican Grill fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs Chipotle Mexican Grill Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nGiven that Chipotle Mexican Grill doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Chipotle Mexican Grill's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

        "title": "Should You Buy Chipotle Stock Before Its Ginormous 50-for-1 Stock Split?",
        "content": "If you're going to do something, do it big. That appears to be the mindset of Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE: CMG) board of directors.\n\nLast Tuesday, Chipotle announced that its board approved a 50-for-1stock split. It's not a done deal just yet. Shareholders must approve the stock split at the annual meeting scheduled for June 6. However, assuming there are no roadblocks, the Mexican restaurant chain will split its shares after the market closes on June 25. Should you buy Chipotle stock before its ginormous 50-for-1 stock split?\n\nOne of the biggest stock splits ever\n\nBefore we address whether to buy Chipotle stock, let's first look at the historic nature of the company's upcoming move. Chipotle noted in its press release last week, \"This would be one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) history.\"\n\nWhy is Chipotle's stock-split ratio so unusually high? For one thing, the restaurant chain has never conducted a stock split in its 30 years of operations. Companies that conduct stock splits more frequently typically will have lower stock-split ratios.\n\nThe main reason, though, is simply that Chipotle stock has skyrocketed over the years. Its share price currently hovers at a little under $3,000. Such a high share price makes a 50-for-1 stock split practical.\n\nChipotle's motivation for splitting its shares isn't surprising. Chief Financial and Administrative Officer Jack Hartung said, \"[W]e believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors.\"\n\nReasons to consider buying Chipotle stock\n\nShould those Chipotle employees and other investors consider buying the stock? There are several reasons the answer could be \"yes.\"\n\nChipotle's business is booming. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company's revenue jumped 15.4% year over year to $2.5 billion. This increase wasn't just the result of Chipotle opening a record number of new restaurants. Same-store sales at its existing restaurants rose 8.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's adjusted earnings per share soared 25% higher in Q4. This performance was made possible in part by an impressive improvement in operating margins at the corporate and restaurant levels.\n\nInvestors should also like that Chipotle is expanding into international markets. The company opened its first restaurant in Calgary, Canada, in 2023. It plans to open between 10 and 14 new restaurants in Canada this year. Chipotle also signed its first international partnership in 2023, teaming up with Alshaya Group to open restaurants in the Middle East.\n\nHowever, the primary growth opportunity for Chipotle is still in North America. CEO Brian Niccol said in the Q4 earnings call that he believes the company will be able to \"more than double our restaurants in North America\" over the long term. He also thinks that Chipotle will be able to further increase its industry-leading profit margins.\n\nTwo glaring omissions\n\nThere were two glaring omissions from the reasons I mentioned for buying Chipotle stock. One is the upcoming stock split. I think it's possible that the split could cause shares to jump even more than they already have. But even if shares rise, the impact will likely only be temporary. Stock splits change nothing about the fundamentals of a company's business or prospects.\n\nThe other thing not referenced above is Chipotle's valuation. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 52.6. Although Chipotle continues to deliver strong growth, it's not growing fast enough to justify that premium multiple, in my view.\n\nI don't think investors should buy Chipotle stock before its ginormous 50-for-1 stock split. I don't think they should buy the stock after a split, either. There are too many other stocks that offer better bang for the buck.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "We are almost three months into 2024, and it's nothing new from Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). Shares of this popular Tex-Mex restaurant chain are up 27% year to date. And in the past five years, this top restaurant stock is up more than fourfold, crushing the gains of both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nIn fact, shares have climbed from just $22 when Chipotle went public in early 2006 to over $2,900 per share as of this writing. This incredible run has spurred management to announce a 50-for-1 stock split.\n\nThere's no question Chipotle has been a magnificent stock through most of its history, but that doesn't mean it's an automatic buy. Let's take a closer look at the fast-casual pioneer.\n\nSatisfying hungry shareholders\n\nRevenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) have grown at annualized rates of 15% and 48%, respectively, in the past five years. Management continues opening new stores at a rapid pace, and the company ended 2023 with 3,437 locations. Chipotle is also heavily focused on its booming digital business, which allows stores to better serve customers while at the same time supporting higher margins.\n\nWith average unit volumes climbing above $3 million last year and restaurant-level operating margin expanding to 26.2%, Chipotle is executing at a very high level. This momentum, in the face of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, explains why investors have gravitated toward the stock.\n\nExpectations are way too high\n\nWhile I don't believe anyone will tell you with a straight face Chipotle is not a high-quality business, that doesn't mean it's smart to buy the stock right now.\n\nIf you were to invest in Chipotle today, you'd have to pay a premium price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 65. Even when factoring in its strong results and brand presence, the valuation is just too high.\n\nThis becomes increasingly apparent when you consider Chipotle's growth potential. Management has set a long-term target of operating 7,000 stores in North America, approximately double the current count.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile this seems impressive at first glance, Chipotle's earnings will need to increase at a truly astounding clip in the coming years to justify the stock's valuation. Meanwhile, it's P/E valuation is likely to continue to contract as it has in recent years due to the maturing business.\n\nInvestors also might be wondering how the recently announced stock split could affect the situation, but it won't change anything long term.\n\nNonetheless, the stock will probably continue to attract a lot of investor attention and enthusiasm, resulting in a stubbornly frothy valuation. Despite the temptation, buying shares of businesses that are priced for perfection is a losing game in my opinion.\n\nHere's where patience is necessary. Add Chipotle to your watch list, continue monitoring the company, and be ready to buy the stock should the valuation become more attractive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Chipotle Stock Ahead of Its 50-for-1 Stock Split?",
        "content": "Burrito-centric restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) made its public market debut way back in 2006. But in June, it plans to do something it's never done before: split its stock.\n\nManagement is proposing a massive 50-for-1 stock split, meaning investors will receive 49 additional shares for every share they currently own. It's not quite a done deal yet as the plan needs shareholder approval, but it's likely to go through.\n\nStock splits are enjoying their time in the financial headlines. However, there are more important things to watch with Chipotle stock, and there's only one thing that could be meaningful when it comes to the 50-for-1 split.\n\nWhat investors need to know\n\nThere's no reason to rush out and buy Chipotle stock ahead of its stock split because stock splits don't do anything to create shareholder value. As of this writing, Chipotle stock trades near $3,000 per share. After the 50-for-1 split, it will trade closer to $60 per share -- no value created or lost.\n\nIn the future, Chipotle will create shareholder value as it has in the past -- with profitable growth of its business.\n\nChipotle really has been a marvel since it went public. The company has grown from roughly 500 locations to more than 3,400 today, fueling its revenue growth. But the top line has also benefited from higher sales per location -- average unit volumes more than doubled from $1.4 million in 2005 to over $3 million at the end of 2023.\n\nMore locations and higher sales per location have led to explosive growth for Chipotle's bottom line too. CMG Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThis is how Chipotle has pushed its stock from $22 at IPO to over $2,900 as of this writing, and this is how it will continue to create shareholder value going forward.\n\nTo be clear, Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol believes the company's growth story is far from over. When reporting full-year 2023 results, Niccol said the company can surpass 7,000 locations in North America long term, which is more than double its footprint today. And he believes average unit volumes can eventually climb above $4 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle's stock split won't affect its ability to reach these business goals, which is why investors are far better served focusing on the business itself.\n\nThere are some reasons to care about the stock split\n\nI just laid out why stock splits don't matter, but I'll concede there are other benefits to Chipotle's 50-for-1 split. First, a stock trading at $60 per share is easier for everyday investors to stomach than one trading at $2,900 per share. Not everyone has access to fractional shares, and the post-split price could bring new investors into Chipotle stock.\n\nOn a related note, Chipotle stock options will became much more attainable as well. With options contracts, investors must deal with at least 100 shares. At current levels, options for Chipotle require close to a $300,000 consideration, again pricing out many people.\n\nThere are hundreds of stock-option strategies, and many of them are extraordinarily risky. But one of the safer strategies is called a buy-write, and it can be helpful in certain cases. I think Chipotle stock is such a case.\n\nFor context, I love Chipotle's business, but I'm concerned about the valuation of its stock. It's never been a cheap stock, but as the chart below shows, it's now trading at its highest price-to-sales valuation ever. CMG PS Ratio Chart\n\nLet's say an investor wanted to buy 100 shares of Chipotle after the split, but like me, they don't love the valuation. This investor could buy 100 shares and simultaneously sell a call option. For this, the investor would receive payment and consequently lower (modestly) the all-in cost to buy Chipotle stock.\n\nThe downside of this strategy is an investor would have to sell their Chipotle shares if it climbed past the option price within the specified time period. They could potentially miss out on bigger gains while creating a short-term taxable event.\n\nAnother potential options strategy is for existing shareholders. Let's say an investor owns 10 shares of Chipotle that they bought long ago. After the split, they'll own 500 shares.\n\nChipotle doesn't pay a dividend so it's not an income stock. But investors could take their 500 shares and create income with options by using popular strategies. That could be appealing for long-term shareholders.\n\nSo while Chipotle's stock split doesn't involve material changes to the business, it could still have positive implications for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.\u2019s historic stock-split proposal spotlights the enormity of this year\u2019s bull run by showing the lengths the fast-food chain must go to bring its shares within reach of those who enjoy its affordable burritos.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Rejected Terror Alert Before Deadliest Attack in Decades Putin Says Moscow Attack Suspects Detained on the Way to Ukraine Catherine, Princess of Wales, Says She\u2019s Being Treated for Cancer NY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is Unpaid Baltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each\n\nThe 50-to-1 split announced on Tuesday will be one of the largest ever on the New York Stock Exchange if shareholders approve it at Chipotle\u2019s annual meeting on June 6, the California-based company said. If it\u2019s agreed to, the stock will begin trading on a post-split basis on June 26.\n\nWhile the move won\u2019t change anything about the company except for its price per share, it still caused excitement: Chipotle shares rallied to fresh highs, building on a record-breaking run that has sent the stock up more than 26% this year.\n\n\u201cChipotle\u2019s 50-for-1 stock split is unheard of,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, a Wall Street veteran with nearly a half century of experience as a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything of this size. It\u2019s unusual.\u201d\n\nRead more: Nasdaq 100 Heads for First Year Since 2010 Without a Stock Split\n\nA stock split simply takes a share and carves it up into multiple slices without changing the overall value or ownership pool. Companies pursue splits \u2014 or reverse splits, which do the opposite \u2014 largely for perception reasons. When a stock price is too high, it can turn off retail investors. When it\u2019s is too low, it can make a company seem cheap in a tawdry way.\n\nSplits fell out of favor as buying fractional shares became more popular in recent times, Silverblatt explained. Last year, only four companies in the S&P 500 Index executed stock splits. But as stock markets have soared in 2024, there is more of an optics problem for companies with eye-popping share prices. While just two companies have officially split their stock this year, companies realize that it can create more demand for retail customers because the stock has a lower dollar value.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe big question now is, are stock splits coming back?\u201d said Silverblatt.\n\nSticker Shock\n\nChipotle\u2019s rationale for the split is to make its stock \u201cmore accessible\u201d to employees and a broader range of investors. At nearly $2,900, one share of Chipotle is costlier than the average American homeowner\u2019s monthly mortgage payment. A 50-for-1 split would bring Chipotle shares down to roughly $60 as of its Friday closing price, which is more like a takeout order.\n\nThe two S&P 500 companies that split their stocks this year had similar explanations. Cooper Cos. Inc., which sells health-care products including contact lenses, enacted a 4-for-1 split in February. Discount-retail behemoth Walmart Inc. followed soon behind with a 3-for-1 split. Old Dominion Freight Line then announced a 2-for-1 split that is set to take place at the end of March.\n\nBeyond the goal of removing share-price sticker shock, the splits have the potential to expand the investor pool, therefore increasing liquidity and demand. Walmart hit a record after its split, even as major shareholders in the Walton Family sold $1.5 billion worth of stock.\n\n\u201cIf Chipotle is gonna split the stock, lets get it back down to a reasonable price,\u201d said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, who is overweight the stock. \u201cEven though pricing has gone up with inflation, people are still willing to pay for the burritos! We like this stock and we\u2019re riding this out.\u201d\n\nStunning Size\n\nChipotle\u2019s stock-split proposal drew particular attention because of its size.\n\nOther than a few larger splits attached to share offerings, Chipotle\u2019s adjustment ties Berkshire Hathaway for the biggest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Berkshire\u2019s 50-to-1 split of its B shares in 2010 was a part of its acquisition of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe.\n\n\u201cI thought I misread it,\u201d Ken Mahoney, president and chief executive at Mahoney Asset Management, said about seeing Chipotle\u2019s announcement. \u201cI was on Twitter when it first broke and people always kid around on Twitter,\u201d referring to the platform X by its former name.\n\nChipotle had little choice but to pursue a giant split if it wanted to make its shares accessible to the masses. It is the fourth-highest priced stock in the S&P 500, behind AutoZone Inc., Booking Holdings Inc. and NVR Inc.\n\nRead more: Chipotle Jumps as Stock-Split Plan Seen Expanding Investor Base\n\nWho\u2019s Next\n\nSome market participants expect Nvidia Corp. to be the next in line for a stock split.\n\nThe market-leading artificial intelligence darling is up about 90% this year, building on a record run in 2023 and surging past the level at which it last announced a stock split in 2021.

        "title": "Chipotle Stock Split: Is This Behemoth Restaurant Chain a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) made waves this week with the announcement of its first-ever stock split. But this isn't any old stock split; it's one of the largest in market history, splitting each share into 50 pieces. It's been a long time coming; Chipotle stock has traded at a four-digit price tag for about four years, and it's gained about 175% in that time, almost tripling in price.\n\nLet's go through the reasons Chipotle is splitting its stock, and whether or not the stock is a buy right now.\n\nWhat a stock split achieves\n\nAlthough stock splits have become popular for public companies when their stock price becomes very high, they don't change anything essential about the stock or the company. They just divide the same-sized pie into more and smaller pieces.\n\nChipotle said it decided to split its stock now to make it easier to buy, which is the usual reason. CFO Jack Hartung said, \"We believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors.\" Although these days most investors can invest in stocks with high prices by buying fractional shares, a four-figure price tag can look intimidating. It can also put it out of range for individual or institutional investors that looks for specific criteria.\n\nOne reason investors might be interested in stock split stocks is that they usually indicate a company that's doing well enough for its stock to have soared and hit a high price. Investors have lots of confidence in stock-split stocks prior to any stock split announcement, and that's likely to continue. Hartung continued: \"This split comes at a time when our stock is experiencing an all-time high driven by record revenues, profits, and growth.\"\n\nSome high-profile stock splits that have happened over the past few years include Apple and Amazon, and Walmart recently announced one as well.\n\nForget the stock split; Chipotle is a great company\n\nA stock split itself isn't a great reason to buy a stock. It's important to evaluate any company's fundamentals and not rely on a split to imply that a stock is worth buying. As Hartung pointed out, Chipotle is demonstrating incredible performance leading to record sales and profits. Even more, it's doing it at a time when many companies are feeling tremendous pressure.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue increased 14.3% year over year in 2023 to $9.9 billion driven by a 7.9% increase in comparable sales. Operating margin expanded from 13.4% in 2022 to 15.8% in 2023, and earnings per share (EPS) rose 38.4% to $44.34.\n\nBut can Chipotle keep it up? It definitely seems so. It practically invented (and perfected) the fast-casual restaurant model, and earned loyal fans who love its fresh, mid-priced meals. It draws from an affluent customer base who are more resilient during tough times, and it gets more mass sales when times are better.\n\nThe company opened 271 new locations in 2023 and operated more than 3,400 restaurants as of the end of the last year. However, it sees an opportunity for 7,000 restaurants in North America. Chipotle's presence is fairly saturated in U.S. urban markets, but it's been opening new stores in suburban areas as well as international stores, specifically Canada. It recently signed its first-ever franchise agreement with a Middle Eastern operator to open stores in Dubai and Kuwait.\n\nShould you buy before the stock split?\n\nThere's some data to back up the theory that a stock gains value right after a stock split, suggesting that it might make sense to buy before the split. But that's often near-term momentum, and it doesn't last. In the longer term, stock splits stocks gain value from performance and opportunity.\n\nIf you appreciate Chipotle's solid model and future potential, it doesn't matter when you buy Chipotle stock. It has soundly outperformed the market over its lifetime, and that's likely to continue.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks That Could Skyrocket in 2024",
        "content": "The recent rally in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices has taken them to new all-time highs. Many stocks have also coasted on the wave of optimism to hit new highs, in line with improving investor sentiment over the reduced pace of inflation. Many companies are also seeing their revenue and earnings rise, thus helping to justify higher valuations and providing fuel for the rally.\n\nThere has never been a better time to search for good growth stocks to own for the long term. With interest rates poised to decline, consumer sentiment should improve and generate optimism that things will get better. Picking stocks with strong market positions, great track records, and astute management will enable you to generate explosive returns over time.\n\nThere are three stocks with these attributes that could even be positioned to soar for the remainder of the year. Here's why we think this trio of stocks should do well. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) owns and operates around 3,400 restaurants in the U.S. and Europe, serving a wide variety of delicious Mexican-inspired offerings. The company has logged consistent growth over the past three years, with 2023 being no different.\n\n2023 saw revenue rise 14% year over year to $9.9 billion, with comparable restaurant sales increasing by 7.9% year over year. Chipotle also managed to increase its overall operating margin from 13.4% to 15.8% and restaurant operating margin to 26.2%, up from 23.9%. The Mexican-themed restaurant chain continued to expand its reach, with the record opening of 271 new restaurants for the year.\n\nChipotle has demonstrated steady growth, with revenue rising from $7.5 billion in 2021 to $9.9 billion in 2023. Net profit climbed from $653 million to $1.2 billion over the same period, even as the number of shares fell by close to 3%, allowing earnings per share to soar 94% from $22.90 to $44.34. The business also generated increasing free cash flow for all three years, rising from $840 million in 2021 to $1.2 billion in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\n2024 promises to be an interesting year for Chipotle, as it targets to open between 285 and 315 new restaurants. Management also projects full-year, mid-single-digit year-over-year comparable restaurant sales growth.\n\nLast year, Chipotle inked its first-ever development agreement with franchise operator Alshaya Group to open restaurants in the Middle East as part of its efforts to internationalize the business. Investors can look forward to the company opening new restaurants in Dubai and Kuwait that will contribute to its top line.\n\nChairman and CEO Brian Niccol remains confident that Chipotle can achieve its long-term goal of opening 7,000 restaurants in the U.S. while continuing to improve its margins.\n\n2. Caterpillar\n\nCaterpillar(NYSE: CAT) is a manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, as well as diesel and gas engines, turbines, and locomotives serving three key sectors: construction, resource, and energy & transportation. The company's share price recently hit a record high after it reported a solid set of earnings for 2023.\n\nRevenue rose 12.8% year over year to $67.1 billion, while operating income surged by 64% year over year to $13 billion. Net income climbed 54.1% year over year to $10.3 billion. It was Caterpillar's best year in its 98-year history, with the equipment company declaring a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share, capping a consecutive, three-decade increase in its dividend.\n\nSales climbed from $51 billion in 2021 to the current $67.1 billion for 2023, with net income jumping from $6.5 billion to $10.3 billion over the same period, showcasing Caterpillar's consistent growth in both its top and bottom lines. Diluted earnings per share nearly doubled from 2021 to 2023, going from $11.83 to $20.12. The company also generated consistent free cash flow in all three years, going from $4.7 billion in 2021 to $9.8 billion in 2023.\n\n2024 should see an operating margin at the top end of Caterpillar's projected range, with an increase in prices to exceed manufacturing costs. The company's strong pricing power showcases its ability to maintain sales volume while upping its prices to keep ahead of inflation. Services revenue is also expected to grow, as Caterpillar targets $28 billion of such revenue by 2026. Investors should note, however, that Caterpillar's revenue and earnings can be cyclical. The heavy equipment manufacturer tends to do well when the economy is on an upswing because of higher demand for construction and infrastructure development. When a downturn arrives, demand may fall sharply as its customers cut back on spending and delay their projects. Despite this cyclicality, Caterpillar remains a solid stock to own as its revenue and earnings have trended higher over time, thus showcasing its dominant position and pricing power.\n\n3. Ulta Beauty\n\nUlta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA) is the largest specialty beauty retailer for cosmetics, fragrances, skincare products, and hair care services in the U.S., with 1,385 retail stores across 50 states as of March 14.\n\nThe company's recently ended fiscal 2023 saw the retailer report a 9.8% year-over-year rise in revenue to $11.2 billion. Operating income edged up 2.4% year over year to $1.7 billion, while net income increased by 4% year over year to $1.3 billion. Ulta Beauty also generated a positive free cash flow of $1 billion for the fiscal year.\n\nFiscal 2023 caps off a successful year of growth, where the retailer opened a total of 30 new stores. Ulta Beauty boasts a track record of rising sales and profitability over the past three fiscal years. Sales rose from $6.2 billion in fiscal 2020 to $10.2 billion for fiscal 2022, with net income surging from $176 million to $1.2 billion over the same period. The cosmetics specialist also generated consistent positive free cash flow averaging $905 million for all three fiscal years.\n\nThese numbers attest to the strength of Ulta Beauty's franchise and showcase its growing membership base. Its loyalty program saw the number of members rise from 32 million in fiscal 2018 to 40 million in fiscal 2022, with close to 95% of sales made by its members. Euromonitor estimated back in 2022 that the U.S. beauty products market is worth $104 billion, implying that Ulta Beauty still has room for significant future growth in this large but fragmented market.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Ulta Beauty expects comparable sales to continue growing by 4% to 5%, with plans to open another 60 to 65 net new stores. Investors can look forward to continued growth for Ulta Beauty as it caters to a wide assortment of customers with a variety of price points through its omnichannel offerings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Caterpillar right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Caterpillar, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Caterpillar wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "With fourth quarter 2023 earnings season just about done, some clear winners have emerged. Strong prints and bullish outlooks have catapulted some stocks higher by 20% or more in recent weeks. At the same time, exceptional financial results have sent analysts running to revise their ratings and price targets on certain stocks. Smart investors should be paying attention to the analysts\u2019 top stock picks as these ratings and targets can go a long way in influencing sentiment and the buying intentions of investors. Some stocks that had been in decline for years have now turned around their operations and finances, requiring a total rerating.\n\nBeyond earnings, some securities are seeing their share prices rise due to other catalysts that range from dividend increases and new partnerships to an improved economic outlook and the adoption of cutting edge technologies. Whatever the reasons, analysts clearly favor certain stocks in this bull market and their ratings reflect this fact. Here are three of the analysts\u2019 top stock picks right now.\n\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS) Exterior of Dick's Sporting Goods retail store including sign and logo.\n\nSource: George Sheldon via Shutterstock\n\nAnalysts have been scrambling to upgrade the stock of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) ever since the sporting goods retailer issued strong financial results a few weeks back. Loop Capital raised its price target on DKS stock to $220 a share from $150, while Barclays lifted its price target to $239 from $194 and maintained a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the shares. The upgrades come with DKS stock up 52% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDKS stock has been surging ever since the company reported the biggest quarterly sales in its history and raised its dividend by 10%. Going forward, Dick\u2019s will pay a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share. Last year, the company doubled its dividend payment as sales and profits continued to rise coming out of the pandemic. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods also provided bullish guidance for 2024, leaving analysts drooling at the growth prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts are loving the plan by Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) to execute a 50-for-1 stock split in June of this year. Analysts at Baird raised their price target on CMG stock to $3,150 a day after the split was announced. That implies nearly 9% upside from current levels and comes after the stock has already risen 78% in the last 12 months. Baird notes that the stock split will provide liquidity and attract price-conscious retail investors.\n\nSimilarly, Deutsche Bank just raised its price target on CMG stock to $3,300 a share, implying 14% upside from current levels while maintaining a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the shares. The stock split is the first ever by Chipotle, which went public in 2006. Analysts on Wall Street have called for a stock split over many years, arguing that lowering the share price will make the stock more accessible to people.\n\nGap (GPS) A close-up view of a Gap (GPS) sign in the window of a Los Angeles, California mall.\n\nSource: Alex Millauer / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe turnaround story at clothing retailer Gap (NYSE:GPS) also has Wall Street drooling. Analysts at Barclays, Evercore, Baird and Bank of America each raised their price targets on GPS stock and placed \u201cbuy\u201d equivalent ratings on the shares after Gap crushed its most recent earnings print. A year ago, GPS stock was in the doldrums. So far this year, the shares are up 36%.\n\nWhile Gap\u2019s financial results have been strong, what Wall Street really likes is the turnaround story the company is telling. The company\u2019s Old Navy brand saw sales grow in the most recent quarter for the first time in more than a year, overall gross margins rose 5.3% to 38.9% due to fewer markdowns and inventory levels decreased by 16% last year, enabling Gap to again sell its clothing items at full price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "This Company Just Announced a Historic Split: Time to Buy?",
        "content": "Many stock splits have occurred in recent years, with companies aiming to increase liquidity within shares and erase barriers to entry for potential investors. Lower share prices are more affordable for a greater portion of investors, although it\u2019s worth noting that the rise of fractional share investing has alleviated this issue for some.\n\nOf course, stock splits are purely cosmetic changes that do not affect the company's valuation or financial health.\n\nRecently, beloved Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG announced a historic 50-for-1 split, with shares seeing a nice pop following the announcement. Let\u2019s take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up and other examples of recent splits.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican restaurant chains. It\u2019s the first split in the company\u2019s history, hoping to make shares more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors. Shares are expected to begin trading on a post-split basis on Wednesday, June 26th, 2024.\n\nThe company\u2019s sales growth has been spectacular, with CMG posting double-digit percentage annual sales growth in back-to-back years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCMG shares have been in a league of their own over the last year, gaining nearly 80% and widely outperforming relative to the general market. The company\u2019s strong growth has supported the robust share performance, with estimates for its current fiscal year (FY24) suggesting 18% earnings growth on 13% higher sales. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company is coming off a strong FY23, opening a record number of new restaurants and establishing its first international partnership. Margin expansion was also prevalent, with CMG\u2019s operating margin moving to 15.8% from 13.4%.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It\u2019s worth noting that analysts have maintained a rosy outlook for its FY24, with the $53.11 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 5% over the last year (+18% Y/Y growth).\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWalmart\n\nRetail giant Walmart WMT recently underwent a 3-for-1 split, with shares trading on a split-adjusted basis starting on February 26th and reflecting the first split since 1999. Analysts have been bullish regarding its current fiscal year (FY25), with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up nearly 6% over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares have added +3.6% in value since the split date, outperforming the S&P 500 just marginally. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nConsumer staples favorite Celsius CELH underwent a 3-for-1 split on November 15th 2023, with shares up a staggering 80% since. Investors were pleased with its latest set of quarterly results, causing shares to pop post-earnings near early March. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNo different than those above, analysts have become bullish on the company\u2019s current year outlook, raising the $1.09 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate nearly 90% over the last year. The value suggests 41% earnings growth, whereas sales are forecasted to see a 40% boost. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nSplits are an exciting announcement that shareholders can receive, essentially slicing the same pie into additional portions. And over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen many companies, including Walmart WMT and Celsius CELH, split their shares to boost trading liquidity and knock down barriers of entry.\n\nMost recently, market titan Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG announced a historic 50-for-1 split, with shares enjoying buying pressure post-announcement.\n\nSplits do not affect a company's valuation or financial health \u2013 they simply make investing more accessible for more investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Volatility is a given when putting your money to work on Wall Street. Since this decade began, all three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years. While most investors are probably hoping for an end to this pattern in 2024, it nevertheless speaks to the unpredictable nature of stocks over the short term.\n\nHistorically, when volatility and uncertainty crop up, professional and retail investors have a tendency to seek out companies that have consistently outperformed in virtually any economic climate. One perfect example of this is investors flocking to the FAANG stocks for more than a decade. But in recent years, it's stocks enacting splits that have been the cream of the crop. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA \"stock split\" is a purely cosmetic event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count. It's cosmetic in the sense that a stock split doesn't change a company's market cap or its operating performance.\n\nA forward-stock split can make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who don't have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Conversely, reverse-stock splits are designed to increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange. With few exceptions, investors tend to focus on high-flying businesses conducting forward-stock splits.\n\nNearly a dozen high-profile companies have enacted forward splits since mid-2021\n\nCompanies that enact forward splits are usually highly profitable and on the leading edge of the innovative curve within their respective industries.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, just shy of a dozen high-profile companies have completed forward-stock splits, including Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), and Walmart(NYSE: WMT). Amazon and Tesla conducted forward splits of 20-for-1 and 3-for-1 in 2022, respectively, while Walmart's 3-for-1 forward-stock split went into effect last month.\n\nStory continues AMZN Chart\n\nThe reason these businesses have outperformed is because of their well-defined competitive advantages:\n\nAmazon is an absolute juggernaut in e-commerce. The nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales it accounted for in 2023 was nearly six times more than Walmart, its next-closest competitor. Amazon is also the parent of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker that's producing a recurring profit. Last year, Tesla produced just shy of 1.85 million EVs and will likely make a run at topping 2 million production vehicles this year. Walmart has been able to use its size as an advantage. Buying products in bulk helps to lower per-unit costs, which provides a competitive edge on price compared to most local stores and grocery chains. Meanwhile, the vastness of its stores and direct-to-consumer site encourages shoppers to stay within its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 19, another top-notch company announced that it would joining this exclusive group of stock-split stocks. Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill.\n\nMeet Wall Street's tasty new stock-split stock\n\nFollowing the closing bell on March 19, the board of directors of fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) announced a 50-for-1 stock split, which is one of the largest forward splits in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Assuming the split is given the green light by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in June, Chipotle will begin trading at a post-split price on June 26, 2024.\n\nChipotle went public in January 2006 at an initial offering price of $22 per share, but has never split its stock. Shares of the company neared the $3,000 mark shortly after the announcement. A 50-for-1 stock split would reduce Chipotle's share price to just shy of $60 per share, based on where it's trading at the time of this writing.\n\nSaid Chipotle's chief financial and administrative officer, Jack Hartung,\n\nThis is the first stock split in Chipotle's 30-year history, and we believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors. This split comes at a time when our stock is experiencing an all-time high driven by record revenues, profits, and growth.\n\nInterestingly, Chipotle's desire to make shares more nominally affordable for its employees echoes what Walmart said when in late January when it announced its 3-for-1 stock split.\n\nChipotle's continued outperformance, which led to this monumental stock split, can be summed up by three catalysts: food quality, its menu, and innovation.\n\nWith regard to the former, Chipotle has strived to use locally sourced vegetables and responsibly raised meats. Just as grocery stores benefited from the organic food push two decades ago, Chipotle is enjoying exceptional pricing power and increased demand because of its use of fresh ingredients.\n\nSecondly, Chipotle tends to keep its menu relatively small. A small menu makes food preparation easier on its staff, which can expedite service times. A limited menu can also lead to more excitement when new food items are introduced.\n\nLastly, innovation has played an important role in the outperformance of Chipotle's stock. A perfect example is the introduction of \"Chipotlanes,\" which are drive-thru lanes specifically designed for mobile orders. Management has done a phenomenal job of improving the operating efficiency of its stores over time.\n\nThis skyrocketing artificial intelligence (AI) stock may split its shares next\n\nWith Walmart completing its split in late February and Chipotle Mexican Grill on track to conduct its first-ever split in late June, it's just a matter of time before another high-quality company joins this exclusive club of stock-split stocks. Given the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) at the moment, the likeliest candidate to follow in Chipotle's footsteps is semiconductor company Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Did you think I was going to say Nvidia?\n\nBroadcom stock ended the trading session on March 19 at a whopping $1,238 per share. That's up more than 1,800% over the trialing decade. Although Broadcom conducted three stock splits prior to be acquired by Avago in early 2016 (Avago chose to keep the Broadcom name), Avago had never announced any stock splits.\n\nAI is a megatrend the likes of which we haven't seen since the advent of the internet. Though estimates are all over the place, researchers at PwC released a report last year that suggested AI could add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. That's music to the ears of Broadcom.\n\nBroadcom's operating performance is liable to be fueled by its Jericho3-AI chip, which the company introduced last spring. Jericho3 has the ability to connect up to 32,000 graphics processing units at once in AI-accelerated data centers. In other words, Broadcom boasts the critical infrastructure that'll be needed to support generative AI solutions and large language model training.\n\nIn addition to its undeniable AI ties, Broadcom's highly profitable foundation is its wireless chip segment. It's a leading provider of 5G wireless chips used in next-generation smartphones. A steady stream of consumers upgrading their wireless devices to take advantage of faster download speeds has led to a healthy backlog of orders for Broadcom.\n\nAlthough Avago's management team has never pulled the trigger on a stock split, a share price north of $1,200 may be the catalyst needed to make the company's stock more nominally affordable for everyday investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Two large-cap stocks that may be catching investors' attention are Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG and IBM IBM as both have been on the cusp of reaching higher highs.\n\nDriven by a remarkable turnaround in its sales growth IBM shares hit 52-week highs of $199.18 last Tuesday. Meanwhile, Chipotle\u2019s continued expansion has been magnified by the company planning a 50 to 1 stock split and hit peaks of over $3,000 a share today.\n\nHaving a dominant footprint in their respective industries, IBM has a market capitalization of $177.65 billion with Chipotle at $76.77 billion. That said, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s time to buy stock in either of these corporate titans as they continue to take market share in the computer-integrated systems and retail restaurant markets respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIBM\u2019s Renovation\n\nFormally known for its computer hardware products IBM\u2019s transformation to software applications including hybrid cloud and AI strategies has put an end to the tech giant's slowing sales growth. Furthermore, IBM\u2019s annual revenue of $60.53 billion spiked 5% last year marking the largest percentage increase since 2011. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIBM\u2019s total sales are projected to rise 3% in fiscal 2024 and are expected to edge up another 4% next year to $66.59 billion. More importantly, is that annual earnings are expected to be up 4% in FY24 and forecasted to pop another 5% in FY25 to $10.58 per share. It\u2019s also noteworthy that FY25 EPS projections would represent 33% growth over the last five years with IBM\u2019s bottom line edging closer to pre-pandemic levels of $12.81 per share in 2019. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nChipotle\u2019s Stock Split\n\nUnprecedented growth has become Chipotle\u2019s trademark but a stock split has long been awaited to make its shares more affordable to retail investors. On Tuesday, Chipotle\u2019s board delivered and announced what will be one of the largest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange history and is expected to take effect on Wednesday, June 26.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering its most recent closing price the 50-1 split would put CMG shares at around $58. With Chipotle\u2019s annual earnings projected to jump 18% this year to $53.11 per share this would be adjusted to roughly $1.06 a share post-split. Notably, Chipotle's EPS is currently forecasted to leap another 21% next year to $64.62 per share or $1.29 a share post-split. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent Performance & Valuations\n\nYear to date Chipotle\u2019s stock has soared +27% while IBM shares have climbed +19% with both outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s +8% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +9%. Over the last year, Chipotle\u2019s stock has now risen +78% with IBM up +54% to easily top the broader indexes. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIBM still trades at a reasonable 19.2X forward earnings multiple which is below the S&P 500\u2019s 21.7X but slightly above its Zacks Computer-Integrtred Systems industry average of 18.2X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs for Chipotle, it has historically been able to command a premium due to its high growth margins and niche as a premium fast food leader. CMG currently trades at 52.6X forward earnings which is well below its decade-long high of 231.1X and closer to the median of 49.7X. However, it is important to remember that following its stock split CMG\u2019s P/E will likely be higher from its EPS being diluted. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAt the moment, Chipotle and IBM\u2019s stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). To that point, longer-term investors may continue to be rewarded but there could be better buying opportunities ahead considering their very strong year to date rallies.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In a rare move on Wall Street, Chipotle Mexican Grill's board has approved a 50-for-1 stock split.\n\nIn an announcement Tuesday, the burrito chain lauded the proposed split as one of the biggest in New York Stock Exchange history \u2014 while noting it believed the move would also boost accessibility of the company's stock.\n\n\u201cThis is the first stock split in Chipotle\u2019s 30-year history, and we believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors,\u201d said Jack Hartung, Chipotle's chief financial and administrative officer, said in a prepared statement.\n\nBut despite approval from its board of directors, the split isn't set in stone just yet. Chipotle still needs the greenlight from shareholders, which is expected in June.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nWHAT IS A STOCK SPLIT?\n\nA stock split is when a company increases its number of outstanding shares. That changes the price per share, but not the overall value of shareholders' holdings.\n\nIn Chipotle's case, the board has approved a 50-for-1 stock split \u2014 meaning each Chipotle share is set to be split into 50 smaller shares. If the split was done today, the price of Chipotle's stock, which stood at around $2,900 midday Wednesday, would soon cost just $58.\n\nHoward Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, notes this is \u201cpartially psychological,\" with companies turning to stock splits in hopes of lowering high prices that may intimate investors. On the other end of the spectrum, there are also reverse stock splits \u2014 which increases price per share, but again doesn't change value of those holders.\n\nSilverblatt added that stock splits overall were much more common decades ago \u2014 but such occurrences have since declined as companies became \u201cmore comfortable with letting the stock price go higher.\" Last year, for example, there were four recorded stock splits in the benchmark S&P 500 index, he said, compared to hundreds seen 20 or 30 years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nHOW RARE ARE THESE KINDS OF STOCK SPLITS?\n\nThe most common stock splits are typically smaller ratios like 2-for-1 or 3-for-1 \u2014 making Chipotle's proposed 50-for-1 move pretty rare in U.S. stock history.\n\n\u201cIn the 47 years that I\u2019ve been at S&P, we have never seen anything like this,\u201d Silverblatt said following Chipotle's announcement Wednesday, noting that a split this large is uncommon for an ongoing company that's not under any duress or litigation. \u201cSomething this size is extremely unusual.\"\n\nWhile there are few similar examples, other big S&P 500 names that have made sizeable splits in recent years include Google's parent company Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 which each unveiled 20-for-1 splits in 2022. Outside of the U.S., South Korea-based Samsung announced a 50-for-1 split back in 2018.\n\nWHY IS CHIPOTLE DOING THIS NOW?\n\nWith the potential of a cheaper going price for a share of Chipotle stock, the fast food chain believes a 50-for-1 split would increase accessibility and open up a wider pool of investors.\n\nTuesday's news from Chipotle also arrives of the heels of months of building gains. Shares for Chipotle are up more than 80% than they were one year ago.\n\n\u201cThis split comes at a time when our stock is experiencing an all-time high driven by record revenues, profits, and growth,\u201d Hartung stated.\n\nLast month, Chipotle reported net income of $1.23 billion, or $44.34 per share, for 2023 \u2014 up from $899.1 million seen the year prior. Total revenue hit $9.87 billion, up 14.5% from 2022.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nAlthough Chipotle's board has approved this stock split, it isn't a done deal yet.\n\nThe company plans to seek shareholder approval on June 6. If the split is approved, shareholders of record as of June 18 will receive 49 additional shares for each share they hold \u2014 set to be distributed after market close on June 25, Chipotle said. Those shares are expected to begin trading post-split on June 26.\n\nShares of Newport Beach, California-based Chipotle were up 3.7% in midday trading Wednesday. Earlier the stock set an all-time high just over $3,023.",

        "title": "Why Chipotle (CMG) Stock Is Up Today",
        "content": "Why Chipotle (CMG) Stock Is Up Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of mexican fast-food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) jumped 7.8% in the morning session after the company announced a 50-for-one stock split.\n\nStock splits often result in a positive market reaction, as they are initiated when a stock's per share price is considered too high to be accessible. When a stock's price is too high -- for example, CMG breached $3,000 per share recently -- some investors (mostly retail investors or employees of the company with smaller amounts of assets to invest) can find it hard to justify buying, as they will end up owning only a fraction of the shares.\n\nFollowing the stock split, every existing share of Chipotle's common stock will automatically convert into fifty shares. For instance, if you owned one share priced at $2500, after the split, you would own 50 shares priced at $50 each, maintaining the total value of your investment at $2,500.\n\nAs a reminder, a stock split does not change anything about the company's fundamentals. It does not actually make the stock cheaper either. We at StockStory--as well as the professional investing public--look at cheapness or expensiveness not based on price per share alone but based on a stock's price compared to its future earnings or free cash flow potential. With this announcement, CMG's operations and therefore its financial profile, will be unchanged. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $2,911, up 4.2% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Chipotle? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nChipotle's shares are not very volatile than the market average and over the last year have had only 3 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was about one month ago, when the stock gained 8.4% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, same-store sales, and EPS exceeding analysts' estimates. The company's outperformance was driven by strong year-on-year unit growth of 7.4%. It also got a pricing tailwind of 1.0% and opened more restaurants in the quarter than expected (121 vs estimates of 117).\n\nStory continues\n\nA highlight of Chipotle's 2023 was that it formed its first international partnership with franchisee Alshaya Group in the Middle East. Should the company lean into franchising more going forward, financial performance could improve since the franchise model generally yields higher-margin royalty revenue and requires less capital investments.\n\nLooking ahead, Chipotle expects same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits for 2024, along with 300 new store openings. Overall, this was a fantastic quarter that should have shareholders cheering.\n\nChipotle is up 29.7% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Chipotle's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,372.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

        "content": "Chipotle is cutting prices\u2014for investors.\n\nThe fast-casual food chain has announced a 50-for-1 stock split, the first stock split in its 30-year history. Assuming shareholders approve the deal when they gather in June, that will make the stock much more affordable for investors.\n\nChipotle stock was trading at $2,972 per share, as of Wednesday morning. Based on that price, the split would bring the price down to a more reasonable $59 per share. The less-expensive shares would begin trading on June 26.\n\nFoot traffic at Chipotle has climbed steadily, bucking industry trends. (Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s have both reported traffic declines.) And as other restaurant chains have struggled to find workers, Chipotle recently underwent a hiring boom, bringing on 19,000 seasonal employees for its busy season (which runs from March through May). As part of that hiring blitz, the company introduced enhanced benefits and an Employee Assistance Program.\n\nFor Generation Z, which makes up the vast majority of Chipotle\u2019s workers, that means that once they become eligible for the company\u2019s 401(k) plan, the restaurant will match up to 4% of their salary in 401(k) contributions when those workers make eligible student loan payments.\n\nBoth private and federal loans are eligible for the student loan match program.\n\nPut another way\u2026 If an employee has monthly loan payments of $150, the company will contribute that amount to their 401(k)\u2014up until they reach 4% of the worker\u2019s annual salary. (Wages at the company  average wage $17 per hour.)\n\nIn its most recent fiscal quarter, Chipotle blew past earnings projections, reporting restaurant traffic growth of 7.4% and earnings per share of $10.36, versus an expected $9.75. Revenue came in at $2.52 billion.\n\nThe chain opened 121 new locations in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "There's no denying that Chipotle(NYSE: CMG) is one of the most widely recognized companies in the world. Last year, the burrito purveyor even made the Time 100 list of Most Influential Companies for \"helping farmers switch to organic produce, using renewable energy, composting, and directly tying executive bonuses to ESG goals.\" The company was also cited for its savvy approach to social media.\n\nIts continuous execution and impressive business performance have contributed to a surging stock price. Over the past year, Chipotle stock has gained an impressive 74%, but that's just the beginning. For those lucky enough to get in on its IPO in early 2006, the stock has soared from $22 to roughly $2,798, a mind-boggling gain of 12,616%.\n\nIn a press release that dropped after the market close on Tuesday, Chipotle announced plans to split its stock for the first time in the company's 30-year history. This stunning revelation is generating a fresh wave of interest in the restauranteur and its stock. It also raises questions for shareholders regarding the mechanics of a stock split and what it means to investors. Image source: Chipotle.\n\nThe stock split details\n\nManagement announced that its board of directors had approved a 50-for-1 stock split, \"one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange history.\" The stock split will be subject to shareholder approval at Chipotle's annual meeting on June 6. Assuming Chipotle investors approve the measure, shareholders of record as of Jun. 18, 2024 will receive an additional 49 shares of stock for each share they own after the close of business on June 25. The shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on June 26. The schedule may vary somewhat from brokerage to brokerage, and it may be a few days before the newly minted shares materialize.\n\nLet's provide some context to simplify the process. For each share of Chipotle stock an investor owns -- currently trading for roughly $2,800 per share (as of this writing) -- post-split, shareholders will own 50 shares worth $56 each.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs a stock split a good thing?\n\nAs the example above illustrates, the total value of the shares doesn't change. One share of Chipotle stock priced at $2,800 is worth the same amount as 50 shares worth $56 (50 x $56 = $2,800). The pizza analogy is useful in this instance. If you buy a pizza, it doesn't matter if you cut it into 8 slices or 16 slices, you still have the same amount of pizza. Similarly, Chipotle stockholders will simply have a greater number of less expensive shares.\n\nAnother school of thought suggests investor psychology comes into play. There is frequently a great deal of excitement in the weeks and months leading up to a stock split, with investors temporarily driving up the share price to \"get in\" on the stock split. Some believe the lower price fuels a commensurate increase in demand for the shares as the stock becomes more appealing to individual investors, but that phenomenon is historically short-lived. Over the longer term, the company's business performance and financial results will drive the stock higher or lower.\n\nIs Chipotle stock a buy now?\n\nWhile the stock split itself doesn't suggest Chipotle is a buy, there are plenty of other reasons to invest in the fast-casual restaurant stock and the company's recent financial report is chock-full of evidence.\n\nIn 2023, Chipotle generated revenue of $9.9 billion, up 14%, resulting in diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $44.34, up 38%. The fact that EPS is outpacing revenue growth is a sign of scale and leverage, with more profits dropping to the bottom line. Furthermore, Chipotle's comparable restaurant sales (or comps) increased 7.9%, as the number of transactions jumped 5%, and the average check increased 2.9%. That growth is particularly impressive, given Chipotle's market cap of roughly $77 billion.\n\nThere are other reasons to be optimistic. The company's Chipotlane strategy has been a smash hit. The drive-thru lanes -- dedicated to picking up prepaid mobile orders -- have proven to drive greater sales and increase profit margins. Chipotle closed out 2023 with 811 Chipotlanes, and the company could add as many as 200 more in 2024.\n\nChipotle's aforementioned digital strategy is also driving growth. The company's rewards program surpassed 36 million members in 2023, an increase of 14%. This has helped digital orders grow faster than in-restaurant sales, representing 37% of total food and beverage revenue in 2024.\n\nThis suggests that while investors shouldn't buy Chipotle shares based solely on its impending stock split, the company's long track record of strong execution, blistering share price gains, and robust performance make it a winning investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "By Savyata Mishra\n\n(Reuters) - Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill were up nearly 6% at $2960 premarket on Wednesday after the burrito chain's board approved a 50-for-1 stock split as the company looks to make the stock less expensive for potential investors.\n\nShares of the California-based company have rallied to record levels over the past year, powered by strong earnings owing to solid demand for burritos and rice bowls among its relatively wealthier customer base.\n\nA stock split lowers the price of shares without affecting the company's valuation, making them more affordable for individual investors.\n\nIf the split is approved at the upcoming annual meeting on June 6, Chipotle's shareholders will receive an additional 49 shares for each share held.\n\nThe stock closed at $2,797.56 on Tuesday, making it the fourth-highest-per-share value on the S&P 500 index. Its market value was $76.71 billion.\n\nThe split, the first in its 30-year history, \"will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors,\" said Chipotle's Chief Financial and Administrative Officer Jack Hartung on Tuesday.\n\nBased on Tuesday's closing price, the stock would trade at around $56/share after the split. The company has around 27.4 million shares outstanding.\n\n\"Chipotle's stock split should ease liquidity in the stock given how high the share price has risen over the past years. Otherwise, the economics of the business remain just as compelling,\" said Jim Sanderson, an analyst with Northcoast Research.\n\nIts forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E), a common benchmark for valuing stocks, is 49.72, higher than industry peers including Starbucks and McDonald's that have a P/E ratio of 20.89 and 22.24 respectively.\n\n(Reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)",

        "content": "Buying shares in the best businesses can build meaningful wealth for you and your family. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. For example, the Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) share price is up a whopping 311% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. On top of that, the share price is up 21% in about a quarter.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver half a decade, Chipotle Mexican Grill managed to grow its earnings per share at 48% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 33% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 61.51, the market remains optimistic.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Chipotle Mexican Grill's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Chipotle Mexican Grill has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 71% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 33% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Chipotle Mexican Grill better, we need to consider many other factors.

        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG is likely to benefit from strong comp performance Chipotlane add-ons and digital initiatives. Also, the emphasis on menu innovation bodes well. However, inflationary pressures are a concern.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s delve deeper.\n\nKey Catalysts\n\nChipotle benefits from strong comps performance. During the fourth quarter of 2023, comparable restaurant sales increased 8.4% year over year. The upside can be attributed to higher transactions, increased average checks and new restaurant openings. This and consistent strength in digital sales and solid recovery of in-restaurant sales contributed to the company\u2019s performance. In 2023, the comparable restaurant sales increased 7.9% year over year. For 2024, Chipotle anticipates comps growth in the mid-single-digit range, driven by its transaction growth and strong comps growth trends.\n\nThe company continues to focus on the addition of Chipotlanes to drive growth. During the fourth quarter, Chipotle opened 121 new restaurants, with 110 locations, including a Chipotlane. The addition of Chipotlane enhanced customer access and convenience and bolstered new store restaurant sales, margins and returns. It continues to expand its digital drive with Chipotlane. The company expects to open 285-315 restaurants (assuming developer, permit, inspection, and utility delays do not impact) in 2024, mostly concentrated in North America, with more than 80% of them including a Chipotlane.\n\nChipotle is prioritizing the expansion of its digital initiatives to stimulate growth. The company has initiated improvements within app functionality, encompassing features like order readiness messaging, wrong location detection, reminders to scan for points during checkout and access to prior order history. The enhancements have effectively mitigated friction points and elevated the overall guest experience. Moreover, the introduction of Freepotle for reward members yielded positive results.\n\nThe enhancement in accessibility and convenience, coupled with the rise of Chipotlanes, boosted digital sales contributions to 36.1% in the fourth quarter and 37.4% for the entirety of 2023. The company intends to focus on leveraging customer data and insights to craft targeted marketing campaigns and enhance the digital experience to boost customer frequency and spending over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle is consistently focusing on menu innovation to drive growth. The successful return of the popular Carne Asada as a limited-time offering surpassed expectations, highlighting the synergy among the marketing, culinary, supply chain and restaurant teams. Notably, the emphasis on enhanced flavors and seamless execution bode well. Going forward, the company intends to focus on limited-time offerings and employ creative strategies (highlighting the core menu) to fuel growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past year, the company\u2019s shares have gained 71.1% compared with the industry\u2019s 9.5% growth.\n\nConcerns\n\nChipotle has been facing inflation across most commodities and categories.\r\n\r\nDuring 2023, food, beverage and packaging costs were $2.91 billion compared with $2.6 billion reported in 2022. The upside was primarily driven by inflation across food costs, mainly beef, tortillas and queso. The labor costs increased 10.9% to $2.44 billion from the year-ago levels due to restaurant wage inflation. The company anticipates the inflationary pressures to persist for some time.\r\n\r\nFor first-quarter 2024, the company anticipates the cost of sales to be in the low 29% range owing to higher costs across several line items, most notably avocados and tortillas. For 2024, the cost of sales is expected to be in the low to mid-single-digit range.

        "title": "3 Cash-Cow Stocks Institutional Investors Can\u2019t Get Enough Of",
        "content": "Cash-cow stocks are a unique bunch and a stock segment that many retail investors overlook. In a nutshell, cash-cow stocks have two key traits. First, cash-cow stocks (as the name implies) have high, predictable, reliable and recurring free cash flow per share. In these cases, free cash flow per share is preferable to earnings per share as it is a more reliable metric of cash available to deploy rapidly since it excludes non-cash concerns like depreciation. The more reliable and consistent the free cash flow per share is, the better investors can project profits.\n\nWhich brings up the second point. Cash-cow stocks tend to have high institutional investment rates or, at the very least, specific stakeholders with a ton of capital have a significant say in how the company runs things.\n\nBring both traits\u2014free cash flow and institutional ownership\u2014together and have a cash-cow stock. Specifically, institutional investors with significant positions in the company can lean on management to use free cash flow to buy back shares, boosting per-share pricing and giving the same investors a healthy profit with fewer tax implications than, say, dividend distributions. If you ever see a seemingly banal stock with massive per-share pricing, chances are it\u2019s a cash-cow company.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is one of the top cash-cow stocks and is an example of the entire concept. Priced at more than $2,600 per share, many retail investors may come away from initial analysis shocked that the higher-end fast food retailer\u2019s stock price is so high. But, from a cash-cow perspective, it makes perfect sense.\n\nThe company\u2019s free cash flow per share is consistently high, averaging $12.26 over the past five quarters, with the most recent period\u2019s\u2014\u201cjust\u201d $3.41 per share\u2014dragging down the rest. Excluding the comparatively poor performance, CMG stock\u2019s free cash flow per share was a massive $14.48 between 2022\u2019s third quarter and the same period in 2023. And, like all cash cow stocks, CMG has massive institutional ownership at more than 90%.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle\u2019s highest-profile investor is Bill Ackman, through his investment firm Pershing Square Capital Management, which owns a 3% stake in the company. With a consistently high buyback rate over the past five years\u2014excluding a brief period during the pandemic\u2014Ackman\u2019s investment is paying off massively. Moreover, the trend isn\u2019t set to stop anytime soon, as the company just announced another $200 million repurchasing round.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nKnown for its portfolio of travel-based services, including Priceline and Kayak, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is another cash-cow stock with a surprisingly high share price north of $3,500. Though free cash flow per share dipped recently, BKNG averaged a whopping $61.60 ratio over the past 12 months\u2019 reporting periods. Likewise, institutional owners hold more than 92% of the company and are likely a major factor in the firm\u2019s 8.96% total yield\u2014of which dividends are just 0.25%.\n\nAnalysts project further growth ahead for Booking Holdings as the global travel market finally breaks free from the post-pandemic slump. That\u2019s evident from the company\u2019s most recent earnings report, which saw quarterly gross travel bookings climb 16% year-over-year (YoY) and the same stat bump up 24% annually. Likewise, annual income increased 40% on the heels of a 25% revenue hike\u2014meaning management is effectively navigating higher interest rates and improving profit margin via diligent cost control.\n\nAutoZone (AZO) An AutoZone (AZO) storefront in Saint Augustine, Florida.\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutoZone (NYSE:AZO) is well-loved by auto enthusiasts, but the cash-cow stock is also an institutional investor favorite at a 93% ownership rate and a $3,000 share price. True to form for our cash-cow contingent, free cash flow per share averaged $39.96 over the past five periods with fewer peaks and valleys than CMG and BKNG.\n\nThe company marked a record-setting period and an all-time high after a fantastic second-quarter earnings release. Across the board, AZO\u2019s financials topped past results and expectations. Earnings per share hit $28.89 (more than a $4 bump YoY) while revenue and profit margin both expanded, even as the company had \u201ca difficult holiday comparison for both Christmas and New Year\u2019s\u201d in terms of sale volume.\n\nAutoZone also added a handful of new stores to its portfolio, raising the total retail count to 7,191. With 26 new stores cutting into cash flow but soon operating at full speed, expect free cash flow per share to climb further as each store jumps on the AutoZone flywheel.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

When most people think of fast food restaurants, they immediately think of McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) which is up by 62% over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, smaller fast food chains offer more growth potential for long-term investors. Some of these same corporations provide healthier food which appeals to consumers. While investors can choose from many healthier fast food stocks, few of them match up to Chipotle (NYSE:CMG).\n\nShares of the Mexican fast food chain are up by 76% over the past year. That\u2019s more than McDonald\u2019s 5-year gain. Also, CMG is up by 337% over the past five years.

The firm is gaining market share while posting strong financials.\n\nIn the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal 2024, Deckers Outdoor achieved 16% YOY revenue growth. Also, the company increased its diluted EPS by 44% YOY. The athletic apparel company used its Q3 report to raise revenue and diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nHoka and Ugg led the way to record revenue. Unlike many stocks with these growth numbers, Deckers Outdoor still has a reasonable valuation. Shares trade at a 33 P/E ratio.\n\nThe recent S&P 500 addition has a history of rewarding long-term investors. Shares are up by 113% over the past year and have gained 551% over the past five years. Analysts have been bullish on this stock and currently rate it as a strong buy. The highest price target of $1,150 suggests a 25% upside from the current price.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) offers stability since people will always turn to the retailer for affordable products.

Additionally, the stock offers a 1.40% dividend yield for investors who seek cash flow from their investments.\n\nWalmart\u2019s recent earnings report demonstrates why the company is positioned to reward investors. Revenue increased by 5.7% YOY. Notable improvements in e-commerce and advertising revenue can ignite future growth. Walmart\u2019s recent acquisition of Vizio Holdings will further strengthen its rising advertising segment.\n\nFinally, the e-commerce segment was up by 23% YOY and surpassed $100 billion in annual revenue. That\u2019s compared to the $648.1 billion in full year revenue. Advertising revenue increased by 28% YOY.

A $10,000 investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) at its initial public offering in the early 2000s would already be worth $611,000. Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) could be next in line.\n\nCava is focused on the Mediterranean fast-casual market, where there's a lot of opportunity for a dominant national chain to fill a void in the industry and do very well. Cava only had 309 restaurants at the end of 2023, but management is aiming for 1,000 restaurants. That might prove conservative given the footprint of more established chains like Chipotle, but the initial target should provide enough runway for growth to deliver excellent returns to start.\n\nA couple of strong quarters of growth have already sent the stock up 33% from its initial public offering price last year. Revenue grew 52% year over year in the fourth quarter. This growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of restaurants opened compared to the year-ago quarter, in addition to a solid 11% increase in same-store sales.\n\nIt was also encouraging to see Cava turn the year-ago net loss of $18.8 million into a profit of $2 million. For the full year, Cava earned a restaurant-level profit margin of nearly 25%, which means earnings per share should continue to grow as it expands across the U.S. It currently operates in just 24 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis restaurant chain has everything a growth investor needs: A concept that is resonating with customers across multiple states, a long runway of growth, and a profitable restaurant model.\n\nA great growth stock at a deep discount\n\nJeremy Bowman (Roku): The S&P 500 is back at an all-time high, and valuations are soaring in multiple sectors. However, one growth stock has been left behind by the recent rally. That's Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU).\n\nShares of the leading streaming distribution platform suffered a double whammy recently. The company delivered a disappointing earnings report in February, and Walmart announced the following week that it was acquiring Vizio, a TV manufacturer with a streaming platform. This sent Roku down again.\n\nRoku is now trading down 41% from its peak in November, setting up a great buying opportunity.\n\nFirst, there was nothing particularly alarming in the Q4 earnings report last month. Roku beat revenue estimates, but management seemed uncertain about the trajectory of the recovery in the ad market, and the company failed to give specific guidance for 2024. The media and entertainment advertisers that it caters to are still struggling as legacy media companies pivot to streaming, but that should change over the next year or two.\n\nAdvertising tiers at services like Netflix, Walt Disney, and Amazon are picking up steam, and new streaming services are expected to launch, like the new sports-focused joint venture from Disney, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery. Disney also set a date for its flagship ESPN streaming service next fall, which could be the biggest launch ever in streaming.\n\nThe volatility that Roku is currently facing should smooth out over time as digital advertising recovers and the streaming landscape stabilizes. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the business, and it still has a huge growth opportunity in front of it, despite a new challenge from Walmart. After all, Roku has grown in spite of competing with tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple.\n\nInvestors can take advantage of a discount on a stock that could easily be a multibagger over the long term by buying today.\n\nMany millionaires already minted\n\nJennifer Saibil (Chipotle Mexican Grill): There are few stocks that are as reliable for growth as Chipotle Mexican Grill. It consistently delivers higher sales and profits, and it still has a long growth runway.\n\nRevenue increased 14.3% year over year in 2023, and comparable sales were up 7.9%. It operates with incredible efficiency, and operating margin expanded from 13.4% last year to 15.8% this year. Earnings per share increased 38% to $44.34. Chipotle generated more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow last year, and it carries no debt.\n\nChipotle was a forerunner of the fast-casual dining segment, and its popular, mid-priced fare draws customers even in more challenging economies. It targets a more affluent, resilient customer who can afford to spend a little more even with high inflation. It's likely to do even better when inflation moderates.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, Chipotle operates 3,437 stores. It opened 271 in 2023, and expects to open about 300 stores this year. It has longer-term plans to expand to 7,000 stores in North America, giving it plenty of room to keep growing. It also recently announced its first-ever international franchise partnership for stores in the Middle East.\n\nChipotle has been a market-beating stock throughout its lifetime, and by a wide margin. Investors can be confident in its continued opportunities. Even if you've missed Chipotle stock's incredible run until now, you can benefit from its future potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). Shares have added about 0.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Chipotle due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nChipotle Q4 Earnings & Revenue Beat\n\nChipotle released fourth-quarter 2023 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis. Earnings surpassed the consensus estimate for the fourth consecutive quarter.\n\nQ4 Earnings & Revenue Discussion\n\nIn the quarter under review, Chipotle reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.36, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.73. The bottom line improved 25% from $8.29 in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nQuarterly revenues of $2,516.3 million surpassed the consensus mark of $2,492 million. The top line jumped 15.4% on a year-over-year basis on the back of strong comparable restaurant sales growth and new restaurant openings. In the reported quarter, Chipotle opened 121 new restaurants with 110 locations including a Chipotlane.\r\n\r\nDigital sales contributed 36.1% to total food and beverage revenues.\r\n\r\nComparable restaurant sales grew 7.9% year over year compared with 5% in the previous quarter. Our estimate was pegged at 6.3%.\n\nCosts, Operating Highlights & Net Income\n\nDuring fourth-quarter 2023, food, beverage and packaging costs, as a percentage of revenues, came in at 29.7%, up 40 basis points year over year. Increased cost across the board, most notably beef produce as well as queso, was marginally overshadowed by menu price increases and lower paper costs.\u00a0 We suggested the metric to be 30%.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter under discussion, the restaurant-level operating margin reached 25.4%, up from 24% a year ago. The uptick was primarily driven by sales leverage. We predicted the metric to be 23.9%.\r\n\r\nAdjusted net income in the reported quarter amounted to $286.2 million, up 23.7% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAs of Dec 31, 2023, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $560.3 million compared with $384 million as of Dec 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nAs of Dec 31, 2023, inventory totaled $39.3 million compared with $35.7 million as of Dec 31, 2022. Goodwill (as a percentage of total assets) reached 0.3% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourth quarter, CMG repurchased $144.3 million worth of stock at an average price of $1,938.8.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, management expects comps growth in the mid-single-digit range.\r\n\r\nCMG anticipates to open 285-315 new restaurants in 2024. It suggests 2024 tax rate in the range of 25-27%.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Chipotle has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Chipotle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nChipotle is part of the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry. Over the past month, McDonald's (MCD), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2023 more than a month ago.\n\nMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.41 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.1%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.\n\nFor the current quarter, McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.72 per share, indicating a change of +3.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for McDonald's. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of F.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Welcome to Episode #393 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss the roaring stock market. If you haven\u2019t bought some of the hottest stocks on the Street, should you still dive in or is it too late to buy?\n\nA friend of Tracey\u2019s asked her over the weekend whether she should buy NVIDIA here. NVIDIA has been hitting new highs nearly every day. There is a fear of missing out, or \u201cFOMO,\u201d component to the stock now if you aren\u2019t already in it. Waiting for a pullback seems useless as there hasn\u2019t been one for weeks.\n\nNot Just Tech Hitting New Highs\n\nBut the question of whether to buy or not after this rally isn\u2019t just about technology stocks. The drug companies with weight loss drugs are also red-hot as are some of the restaurant stocks. Many industries, outside of the banks, oil and natural gas, lithium and the fertilizers, just to name a few, have been up big this year.\n\nIf you\u2019re not yet in these stocks, should you wait for a pullback or should you just dive in?\n\nTracey looked at her favorite stock chart, the Zacks\u2019 Price and Consensus chart, to try and find answers. But maybe the key is NOT the actual technical chart, but in the earnings outlook.\n\nWhat do fundamentals look like?\n\n5 Red-Hot Stocks: Should You Buy or Wait?\n\n1. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA has been one of the hottest stocks this year. It seemingly goes up almost every session. NVIDIA shares are up 80% year-to-date.\n\nBut earnings are expected to rise 79.2% in fiscal 2025 after jumping last year. NVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of 37, which isn\u2019t high for the company historically. NVIDIA also has a PEG ratio of just 1.25. A PEG ratio under 1.0 indicates a company has both value and growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs it too late to buy NVIDIA?\n\n2. Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL)\n\nDell Technologies recently surprised on earnings again and its shares have taken off. Dell is up 55% year-to-date and is at 5-year highs.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise just 0.7% in fiscal 2025 but 15.6% in fiscal 2026. Dell trades with a forward P/E of just 16.4 and a has a low PEG ratio of just 1.37.\n\nIs it too late to buy Dell Technologies?\n\n3. Eli Lilly and Company (LLY)\n\nEli Lilly is tracking NVIDIA in 2024. It seems like the stock hits a new high every day. Shares of Eli Lilly are up 33.8% year-to-date and 145% over the last year thanks to the demand for weight loss drugs.\n\nEarnings are expected to soar 96.8% in 2024. Eli Lilly now has a high forward P/E of 62.5 but it has a PEG ratio of just 1.7.\n\nIs it too late to buy Eli Lilly?\n\n4. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG)\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill continues to impress which is why it is often regarded as one of the top restaurant stocks. Shares of Chipotle are up 17.6% year-to-date but over the last year, they have soared 78.2% to new all-time highs.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise another 18.3% in 2024. Chipotle isn\u2019t cheap on a P/E basis but it hasn\u2019t been for over a decade. Chipotle trades with a forward P/E of 51. It has a PEG ratio of 2.3.\n\nIs it too late to buy Chipotle?\n\n5. CAVA Group, Inc. (CAVA)\n\nCAVA is one of the new up-and-coming restaurant chains. It only went IPO last year, in 2023. But shares of CAVA are up 38% year-to-date.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise 9.5% in 2024 as it continues its growth plan of opening up new locations. CAVA has a sky-high forward P/E of 246, however. And CAVA doesn\u2019t have a PEG ratio on Zacks.com.\n\nIs it too late to buy CAVA?\n\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Buying Stocks During a Big Rally?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Chipotle Mexican Grill, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.23 = US$1.6b \u00f7 (US$8.0b - US$1.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nSo, Chipotle Mexican Grill has an ROCE of 23%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Chipotle Mexican Grill's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Chipotle Mexican Grill  for free.\n\nSo How Is Chipotle Mexican Grill's ROCE Trending?\n\nWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Chipotle Mexican Grill. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 23% and the business has deployed 286% more capital into its operations. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 23%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Chipotle Mexican Grill has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 336% return to those who've held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more \"expensive\" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.\n\nOne more thing to note, we've identified  1 warning sign  with Chipotle Mexican Grill and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our freelist of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has 18% of His Pershing Square Portfolio Invested in 1 Unstoppable Stock",
        "content": "One way individual investors can find lucrative ideas is by following smart investment managers and note what stocks they own in their portfolios. Take Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager of Pershing Square Capital Management. He runs a very concentrated book that focuses on what he believes are high-quality businesses with a long-term mindset.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) is one of Ackman's top holdings, representing 18.2% of the portfolio as of Dec. 31. Ackman's firm has owned the restaurant stock since the third quarter of 2016 at an initial cost basis of about $411 per share. From that price point, shares are up a whopping 545%.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Chipotle's thriving business. Investors can then decide if the stock is a smart buy right now.\n\nA comeback story\n\nIn the last five years, Chipotle's revenue and diluted earnings per share have climbed at compound annual rates of 15.2% and 47.7%, respectively. These strong fundamental gains were undoubtedly the key ingredient for the stock's impressive run.\n\nThe company performed extremely well during the COVID-19 pandemic. It leaned on its strong digital foundation and drive-through locations to serve hungry customers. And even in the last couple of years, a period of economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and recessionary fears, Chipotle continues posting stellar financial results.\n\nIn 2023's fourth quarter, the business reported an 8.4% year-over-year, same-store sales jump driven by a 7.4% increase in transaction counts. This indicates that traffic isn't letting up, and that consumers find tremendous value in Chipotle's offering.\n\nHowever, the business wasn't always firing on all cylinders like it is now. When Ackman first purchased shares more than seven years ago, Chipotle was dealing with the fallout from the E. coli scare, which resulted in falling sales, waning trust, and a tarnished reputation. The famed hedge fund manager was greedy when others were fearful, as the great Warren Buffett emphasizes.\n\nStory continues\n\nLofty expectations\n\nInvestors looking to follow in Bill Ackman's footsteps and take a big bite out of Chipotle stock right now are better off waiting patiently for a more attractive entry price. The market is fully aware of how wonderful this business is. On a forward basis, the current price-to-earnings ratio is about 50. That implies truly huge expectations for the company.\n\nAs a restaurant operator, Chipotle might be the furthest thing from the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, but it certainly has a lot of growth potential. This is likely what investors are most focused on, which is why shares are expensive.\n\nThere are currently 3,437 Chipotle locations that generate an average of $3 million in annual unit volume (AUV). Management believes there could be 7,000 stores open in North America one day that rake in $4 million of AUV. That means the long-term potential is to produce $28 billion in revenue, compared to 2023 sales of $9.9 billion.\n\nThe leadership team had originally targeted 6,000 stores as the ultimate goal. But seeing how well the restaurants were performing, they upped their outlook. It's totally in the realm of possibilities that at some point in the future, they will raise the target again. However, that's unpredictable, as we can't read the CEO's mind.\n\nIt's worth pointing out the 7,000 stores target doesn't include restaurants outside of North America. If Chipotle finds success in other parts of the world, there is even more upside. Based on the current valuation, though, I think this optimism is more than fully reflected in the stock price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investors are eating up Cava (CAVA).\n\nOn Tuesday, shares of the Mediterranean fast casual chain hit a new record of $59.91. Shares are up more than 40% year-to-date, jumping as much as 19% in the last five days after posting a beat on its top and bottom lines for its Q4 results.\n\nFor comparison, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up more than 7% year to date, whereas fast casual powerhouse Chipotle (CMG) is up nearly 20%.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Cava's revenue came in at $177.17 million, versus the $174.09 million expected, while adjusted earnings were $0.02, versus the $0.01 estimated.\n\nSame-store sales soared 11.40% year-over-year, handily besting the 6.25% Wall Street had anticipated.\n\n\"Our results are reflective of how we're able to demonstrate the power of our category defining brand,\" CEO Brett Schulman told Yahoo Finance. He believes there is major \"white space potential in front of us\" in the Mediterranean food sector.\n\nIn a note to clients, JP Morgan analyst John Ivankoe wrote that he believes the company's team and operating structure \"supports the likelihood of CAVA becoming a highly visible, important national brand that should dominate the large and flexible \u201cMediterranean\u201d category.\"\n\nStifel analyst Chris O'Cull wrote to clients that Cava's \"premium valuation can be justified by its healthy unit economics, development visibility, and solid operating momentum,\" which could lead to \"further upward revisions to near-term estimates and long-term earnings potential.\"\n\nJefferies analyst Andy Barish increased his price target 16% from $48.00 to $66.00 following the Q4 results, citing \"an attractive runway ahead for CAVA to further scale.\"\n\nOne persistent problem \u2014 labor costs \u2014 has followed the restaurant industry into 2024.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 22 states raised their minimum wages, while Oregon, Nevada, and Florida are set to increase theirs later this year.\n\nAnd California is facing a looming wage jump as a result of AB 1228 and its predecessor, the FAST Act. Beginning Apr. 1, food chains that have at least 60 locations nationwide will be required to raise their minimum wage for restaurant employees to $20 per hour.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company plans to \"absorb that 30 basis point impact,\" Schulman said, adding that it has always \"aspired\" to pay more than the average wage, as well as \"be competitive and have attractive wages in every market we operate in.\"\n\nIn 2024, the company expects restaurant level profit margin to be between 22.7% and 23.3%, or 150 to 210 basis points below 2023's. Schulman said that the impact on margin from the higher wage growth is \"an investment in our team that will create...restaurant level margin growth over the long haul.\"\n\nIn January, Cava increased menu prices by 2.5% to 3%. The average price per person, which includes premium add-ons to the entrees, is now $14. In August 2023, Schulman told Yahoo Finance the average price per person was \"a little bit north of $13.50.\"\n\n\"We have pricing elasticity,\" he said when asked about his company's pricing power. \"We don't want to just take it because it's there, we want to put the best value proposition for it for our guests,\" he added.\n\nCFO Tricia Tolivar said the company expects the cost of food to increase in the low to mid-single digits in 2024, but Shulman said its new steak offering \"is a premium item and it will be priced as such...we see it as dollar margin neutral to our basket.\" CAVA in Waldorf, Maryland featuring digital order pickup. (Courtesy of CAVA)\n\nCava lays out slow and steady growth plans\n\nBy 2032, the company plans to have 1,000 Cava locations.\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2023, the company had 309 locations, with 72 opened last year, and plans to launch 48 to 52 this year.\n\n\"We are projecting 15% compound annual unit growth,\" Schulman shared, \"we feel really comfortable about our pipeline and our ability to maintain this growth rate.\"\n\nIt plans to enter Chicago this year with three locations, sticking to the model of penetrating established markets.\n\nIvankoe believes the brand is a \"preferred tenant,\" especially as \"the high-profile IPO draws attention to the company\u2019s cash rich balance sheet with less than $300 million and prospects for brand longevity.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the company also got its new food processing facility up and running in Verona, Virginia, which can serve up to at least 750 Cava stores. In addition, it can supply packaged goods like its Crazy Feta and Harissa for up to 1,000 stores.\n\n\"We are in about 650 grocery outlets today and we are slowly growing that,\" Schulman shared, with the new facility providing an opportunity to scale its packaged foods business in the future.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the 16 best cities for retirees in the Pacific Northwest. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Best Cities for Retirees in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe Ease of American Travel - and Its Place in Retirement\n\nWhile Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) are high up on the list of what makes America great, there\u2019s another factor that takes the winning spot - the ease of American travel. Undoubtedly, one of the best things about the US is its lack of inter-state travel requirements. Simply get up, book a flight, pack a bag, and head to the airport - no need for visas or complicated documents or waiting periods. It's partly due to this ease in requirements that the US Federal Aviation Administration handles upwards of 45,000 flights and more than 2.9 million travelers every single day. Of course, a large part of these travelers would be those who are traveling for work-related purposes or for leisure, but there\u2019s also another group in the US that accounts for inter-state moves: retirees.\n\n2023 saw more than 338,000 retirees move states to live out their Golden Years, reports AARP. Not only is this number huge itself, but it also depicts the growth in move-to-retire trends as the 338,000 figure is a 44% increase from 2022\u2019s number.\n\nIn the Advisor Authority survey conducted by Nationwide, findings shed light on the reasons why American retirees move. The reasons listed included the search for a lower cost of living, tax benefits, and relocation for family purposes - in descending order of likelihood. While this survey was conducted with a sample of investors to inquire about their retirement plans, it is plausible to apply the same reasons to a broader group of retirees. All in all, it\u2019s safe to say that retirees venture to find the best cities to retire for 2024.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the reason, now is the time for advisors and financial professionals to check in with clients who are approaching retirement to make sure they have a plan in place for their next steps, and to work together to ensure their path is one that will lead to a secure and happy retirement. It\u2019s also a great opportunity to drive a conversation about what life may look like when they reach a point where they are unable to work, which could come sooner than some may expect\".-Rona Guymon, Senior Vice President, Nationwide Annuity Distribution\n\nStory continues\n\nOf those who do choose to move for retirement, the destination chosen is varied. While Florida still reigns as one of the most popular retirement states, others have claimed their positions. The Pacific Northwest - namely, Idaho - has also made it to the top ten spots, as shared by Forbes. With growing popularity, the Pacific Northwest US states are attracting more and more retirees, and finding the best retirement cities during this trend becomes crucial. While these states don\u2019t offer the magic of Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) - there are over one hundred Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) locations though - they offer something much more valuable to retirees: lower costs of living and lower median house prices in many of their cities.\n\nTo facilitate present and potential retirees in navigating the Pacific Northwest move, we have compiled a list of the 16 best cities for retirees in the Pacific Northwest.  16 Best Cities for Retirees in the Pacific Northwest\n\nSyda Productions/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of the 16 best cities for retirees in the Pacific Northwest, we consulted several sources including our list of 20 Best Cities to Retire for 2024, FinanceBuzz, The Ascent, WorldAtlas, MoneyTalks, and The Honest Local. As the list of Pacific Northwest US states is often disputed, for the purpose of this article we took the definition of National Geographic Maps. They define the following US states as Pacific Northwest: Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, their cost of living, their livability scores, and their median house price. For this article, cost of living indices were taken from Best Places, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and median house prices were taken from Redfin Corp (NASDAQ:RDFN). A cumulative score was then assigned to each city, with the 16 highest-scoring cities making our list of the 16 best cities for retirees in the Pacific Northwest. For cities that gained an equal score, their cost of living index was used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last. It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the 16 best cities for retirees in the Pacific Northwest:\n\n16.

Coos Bay, Oregon\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 75\n\nCost of Living Index: 90\n\nLivability Score: 60\n\nMedian House Price: $318,000\n\nOur third Oregon pick, Coos Bay is an ideal spot for retirees with a smaller retirement bank balance as the cost of living is 10% below the national average. Especially favorable for retirees who are weather-conscious, Coos Bay experiences a mild and pleasant climate with mild winters and cool summers. A coastal city, senior citizens can soak up all the benefits of coastal living, including scenic hiking areas, stretches of sand dunes, and fresh cuisine.\n\n11. Ashland, Oregon\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 76\n\nCost of Living Index: 106.1\n\nLivability Score: 83\n\nMedian House Price: $485,200\n\nIf your retirement plans come with a bit of budget, then Ashland in Oregon is one of the best cities for retirees in the Pacific Northwest - and definitely worth exploring.\u00a0 Home to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and several galleries, the city welcomes classic art lovers and gives them an experience to remember.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nAs the major indexes closed in the red on Wednesday, 43 stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) still managed to hit all-time highs.\n\nIn fact, record highs are piling up in 2024, with a solid 26% of all S&P 500 components (126 total) hitting at least one all-time high this year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) lives up to its hype and tops the S&P 500 in broken records \u2014 notching 23 record highs over 40 trading days this year. It's also at the top of the benchmark index when it comes to returns this year, up over 50%.\n\nBut setting aside the AI-inspired headlines, it's the Industrials sector that has the most all-time highs with nearly half of its components in the S&P 500 hitting records. It also happens to be the second-best-performing sector in February, up nearly 7%.\n\nIndustrial stalwarts like Waste Management (WM) and Caterpillar (CAT) might not have semiconductor cache, but they do have nearly 30 record highs between them. Uber Technologies (UBER), which recently replaced JetBlue (JBLU) in the Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT), buoys the sector's totals as well with 13 record highs and a return north of 25% year to date.\n\nThe top sector by performance this month \u2014 consumer discretionary, up over 7% \u2014 represents a diverse set of industries with stocks at record highs. Restaurants like Chipotle (CMG) and McDonald's (MCD), homebuilders like Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI), and travel stocks like Hilton (HLT) and Booking (BKNG) all contribute to the 100-plus record highs in the sector this month.\n\nBoth the Financials and Health Care sectors each have more than one quarter of their components hitting records in 2024 and are posting the second- and third-best respective sector returns of the year. JPMorgan (JPM) has clocked a respectable eight record highs this year. But insurer Progressive (PGR) hit an overall third-best 21 record highs. Like many insurers, it was among the leaders breaking to new highs late last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough megacap in its own right, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) doesn't get Magnificent Seven headlines. But the insurer sports a market cap over a fifth bigger than Tesla. Warren Buffett's famed conglomerate is up 15% with 15 record highs this year.\n\nIn Health Care, Boston Scientific (BSX) comes in second-best to Nvidia overall with 22 record highs.

        "title": "Stock Splits Watch: 3 Likely Candidates to Keep on Your Radar in 2024",
        "content": "While stock splits don\u2019t necessarily change the valuation of a company\u2019s stock. They do offer some benefits. Namely, they can make a stock more affordable for retail investors. In that way, companies can draw in new shareholders and capital when they split their stock. For existing shareholders, stock splits increase their share count without them having to spend more money. Over time, this can also prove beneficial as it grows the overall investment of an individual stockholder. Institutional investors may not care all that much about stock splits. However, they are closely followed by retail investors who would love to get their hands on the stocks of certain companies. But, they remain out of reach because a single share costs upwards of $1,000 or more.\n\nSome companies have never split their stock despite the price running higher and higher. Yet investors continue to cling to hope that a split will eventually be announced. Here is stock split watch: three likely candidates to keep on your radar in 2024.\n\nLike Candidates for Stock Splits: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock continues to soar and has already risen 64% this year to trade at close to $800. The company\u2019s market capitalization is a hair below $2 trillion. The rapid rise in the share price and its lofty height has ignited speculation that the stock might split. The last time Nvidia split its stock (on a four-for-one basis) in July 2021, the share price had just surpassed $550. Management at the company might be concerned that the rapidly rising stock is putting it out of the reach of retail investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe complicating factor in all of this is that NVDA stock does not look overvalued at current levels. This is perceived given the company\u2019s explosive growth rate. Currently, Nvidia\u2019s shares are the cheapest among the Magnificent Seven group of tech stocks. That\u2019s what happens when a company\u2019s sales rise 265% year-over-year and its profits grow at an annualized rate of 769%. Still, for individual investors, paying nearly $800 for one share of Nvidia no doubt comes with sticker shock. Still, many analysts see the share price crossing $1,000 after the company\u2019s recent blowout earnings report.\n\nStory continues\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nAnother stock and that is starting to look expensive is pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). Up 30% on the year and up 143% over the last 12 months, LLY stock is currently trading at an all-time high of $770 per share. The company\u2019s market capitalization stands at $730 billion and many analysts expect Eli Lilly to become the world\u2019s first $1 trillion dollar pharmaceutical concern. The stock continues to rise as sales of its new weight loss drug called \u201cZepbound\u201d accelerate, prompting speculation that a stock split is coming.\n\nEli Lilly has undergone four previous stock splits, but the last one happened way back in October 1997. Each previous stock split occurred on a two-for-one basis. Given that the stock is at an all-time high and the speed at which the share price continues to rise, a stock split this year would certainly make sense. LLY stock can be expected to continue climbing higher if the company\u2019s earnings keep growing along with global sales of Zepbound. The weight loss drug was only approved by United States regulators last fall, and analysts expect that sales will surpass $1 billion in its first year on the market.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a company that has never split its stock. That would be Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). With its share price near $2,650, CMG stock is out of reach for many retail investors. Given the lofty price, Chipotle is constantly discussed as a stock split candidate. Chipotle has been a consistent winner for shareholders since going public in 2006, having risen 77% in the last 12 months alone, including an 18% gain so far in 2024. But for many investors, the share price remains prohibitive. CMG stock also doesn\u2019t pay a dividend, adding to the frustration of shareholders.\n\nSo is 2024 the year that CMG stock finally splits? Possibly. The company continues to grow its chain of Mexican restaurants and its earnings at a brisk pace. The quick service restaurant company recently reported earnings per share (EPS) of $10.36 compared to $9.75 that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at $2.52 billion versus $2.49 billion that was forecast on Wall Street. Sales were up 15% from a year earlier, while same-store sales increased 8.4%. The company plans to open as many as 315 new restaurant locations in 2024.\n\nSplitting its stock would only add fuel to the fire for CMG stock and serve to draw in retail investors who would love to get their hands on shares of this best-in-class restaurant name.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA and LLY.

        "content": "Introduced in 2022 with $50 million in funds, Chipotle is increasing its commitment to the Cultivate Next venture fund by an added $50 million Cultivate Next will continue to pursue new investments in supply chain, agriculture, restaurant innovation, automation, and other areas that support Chipotle's mission to Cultivate a Better World Chipotle has made additional investments in Local Line and Hyphen, both previously announced cohorts\n\nNEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Feb. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) today announced it is increasing its commitment to its Cultivate Next venture fund by $50 million, which brings the fund's total investment pool to $100 million. Introduced in 2022, Cultivate Next makes early-stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further Chipotle's mission to Cultivate a Better World and help accelerate the company's aggressive longer term growth plans to operate 7,000 restaurants in North America.\n\n\"Our decision to double our commitment to our Cultivate Next venture fund is a clear indicator that we are investing in the right companies that we can learn from and utilize to improve the human experience of our restaurant teams, farmers, and suppliers,\" said Curt Garner, Chief Customer and Technology Officer, Chipotle. \"The parallel growth of Chipotle and our partners will continue to further our mission to Cultivate a Better World by increasing access to real food.\"\n\nCultivate Next Investments\n\nTo date, Chipotle has invested in a wide range of companies innovating in areas such as farming, supply chain, advanced robotics, and plant-based foods.

In the coming months, Chipotle's Hyphen digital makeline will debut in a single restaurant location as part of the company's stage-gate process. Hyphen recently received an additional investment from Chipotle through Cultivate Next. Meati\n\nMeati Foods serves nutrient-dense whole-food products made from MushroomRoot\u2122.

The company has introduced a new category of healthy oils and fats made by fermentation that are more environmentally friendly.\u00a0Chipotle is in the early trials of testing Zero Acre Farms at its Cultivate Center test kitchen in Irvine, California.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It is incredible to see the possibilities that exist when we bring the right founders, startups or ventures into collaboration with Chipotle,\" said Christian Gammill, Cultivate Next Fund Manager. \"Witnessing the progress of our cohorts over the past two years has motivated us to scale our efforts and drive real change in the supply chain, agriculture, restaurant innovation, and automation sectors.\"\n\nThe Future of Cultivate Next Chipotle will continue to provide updates on the Cultivate Next venture fund in 2024 and beyond.

        "title": "What Does Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.'s (NYSE:CMG) Share Price Indicate?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s examine Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nIs Chipotle Mexican Grill Still Cheap?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. We find that Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s ratio of 59.03x is above its peer average of 20.05x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Hospitality industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCan we expect growth from Chipotle Mexican Grill? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Chipotle Mexican Grill's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 70%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in CMG\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe CMG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on CMG for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for CMG, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nKeep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

        "content": "Sweetgreen (SG) Reports Q4: Everything You Need To Know Ahead Of Earnings\n\nCasual salad chain Sweetgreen (NYSE:SG) will be reporting results tomorrow afternoon. Here's what you need to know.\n\nLast quarter Sweetgreen reported revenues of $153.4 million, up 23.7% year on year, missing analyst expectations by 0.8%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' earnings estimates and full-year revenue guidance missing analysts' expectations.\n\nIs Sweetgreen buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Sweetgreen's revenue to grow 28.3% year on year to $152.1 million, improving on the 23% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted loss is expected to come in at -$0.15 per share. Sweetgreen Total Revenue\n\nMajority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last thirty days, suggesting they are expecting the business to stay the course heading into the earnings. The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates six times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Sweetgreen's peers in the modern fast food segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. Wingstop delivered top-line growth of 21.2% year on year, beating analyst estimates by 5.7% and Chipotle reported revenues up 15.4% year on year, exceeding estimates by 1.1%. Wingstop traded down 4.6% on the results, Chipotle was up 2.1%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Wingstop's results here and Chipotle's results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the modern fast food segment, with the stocks up on average 2.3% over the last month. Sweetgreen is up 10% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $13.5, compared to share price of $12.03.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right.

        "title": "Chipotle (CMG) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Chipotle is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Chipotle, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Chipotle\n\nThis Mexican food chain is expected to earn $53.21 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 18.6%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Chipotle. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.6%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Chipotle to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Chipotle (CMG) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).\n\nChipotle currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 62.1% and 6.9% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CMG Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for CMG\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Chipotle here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Chipotle, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs CMG a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Chipotle, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.8% over the past month to $53.21.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Chipotle. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Chipotle may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Walmart Became the Newest Stock-Split Stock Today, and These 3 High-Flying Stocks Appear Primed for Splits of Their Own",
        "content": "Today marks a new era for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Not only is the nearly 128-year-old index undergoing only its 52nd change with the addition of online retailer Amazon and the removal of pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, but the Dow's divisor (the figure that helps convert share price into Dow points) is changing due to Walmart's (NYSE: WMT) 3-for-1 stock split.\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event which allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. The important thing to note with stock splits is that they're purely cosmetic and have no impact on a company's market cap or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nForward-stock splits make a company's share price more nominally affordable for everyday investors, which can be particularly helpful for those without access to fractional-share purchases. Meanwhile, reverse-stock splits are designed to increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange.\n\nWalmart becomes Wall Street's newest stock-split stock\n\nToday, Monday, Feb. 26, Walmart enacted its 3-for-1 forward-stock split, which was first announced on January 30. Walmart CEO and president Doug McMillon noted the reasoning behind the split is to encourage employees to take part in Walmart's Associate Stock Purchase Plan. Said McMillon:\n\nSam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates. Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come.\n\nWalmart has been a prime beneficiary of an above-average inflation rate over the past two years. Walmart's deep pockets and ability to buy products in large quantities gives it a cost and product breadth advantage that mom-and-pop shops simply can't match. With consumers eager for a good deal, Walmart continues to draw in shoppers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart joins the select group of less than a dozen high-profile companies to have conducted a forward-stock split since the midpoint of 2021. It won't, however, be the last widely owned or high-flying public company to declare a split. What follows are three outperformers that are likeliest to follow in Walmart's footsteps and become the next stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first logical candidate to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock after Walmart is none other than social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta hasn't split its stock since going public in 2012, and its share price neared $490 less than two weeks ago.\n\nMeta's long-term success is a function of three factors. To start with, the company's social media real estate is unrivaled. It's the parent company of Facebook, the most-visited social site globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. Collectively, Meta's family of apps attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter. Having access to this many eyeballs is an advertisers' dream, which is why Meta often commands significant ad-pricing power.\n\nSecondly, investors are enamored with the company's potential beyond advertising, which includes augmented and virtual reality devices, becoming an on-ramp to the metaverse, and its various artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Even though advertising makes up nearly 98% of Meta's total sales, the growth potential and addressable market for the metaverse and AI is mouthwatering.\n\nThe third catalyst for Meta has always been its pristine balance sheet. For example, the company closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and it generated $71.1 billion in net cash from operating activities last year alone. It has the luxury to take chances on the innovation front that few other tech-driven companies can match.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nA second high-flying stock that appears primed for a stock split of its own is fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Since its initial public offering in early 2006 at $22 per share, Chipotle stock has rocketed to as much a $2,725 per share, as of roughly three weeks ago. Its sky-high share price is certainly a deterrent to investors without access to fractional-share purchases.\n\nChipotle's recipe for success has long revolved around the quality of its food and its innovation. The company tends to rely on locally sourced foods and vegetables, and has pledged to use only responsibly sourced meats. What Chipotle's management team has found is that consumers are willing to pay more if they're given healthier food choices. As a result, Chipotle hasn't been pinched by inflationary pressures.\n\nTo add to the above, the company has kept its menu reasonably small, which has two advantages. First, a smaller menu allows its employees to efficiently prepare meals and move lines quickly. Secondly, keeping the menu compact helps new product introductions pack more punch.\n\nBut innovation is, arguably, the real secret sauce of late. in 2018, the company introduced the \"Chipotlane,\" which is a drive-thru lane devoted to digital-order pickup. This further sped up the ordering process and improved operating efficiency, which is a key reason Chipotle's bottom line continues to grow by double digits each year.\n\nBroadcom\n\nThe third highflier that looks poised to follow in Walmart's footsteps and join an exclusive club of stock-split stocks is semiconductor company Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Prior to Avago acquiring Broadcom in 2016 and keeping the company's name, the original Broadcom had split its stock three times. Avago, however, never conducted a stock split. A single share of Broadcom set investors back by as much as $1,295 earlier this month.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Broadcom's vast outperformance of the broader market has to do with its ties to the AI revolution. In April, the company introduced Jericho3-AI, which is designed to scale connectivity to as many as 32,000 graphics processing units in high-compute data centers. With businesses practically tripping over themselves to build out AI-accelerated data centers in order to take advantage of AI solutions, Broadcom's traditionally steady growth has turned into outsized sales growth.\n\nHowever, Broadcom still generates a substantial portion of its revenue from wireless chips and accessories designed for next-generation smartphones. The move to 5G has encouraged a steady replacement cycle for smartphones and other wireless devices, which has proven to be a boon to its bottom line.\n\nThe other important factor for Broadcom is that, while tech stocks are usually cyclical, it has a presumably healthy backlog. As of July 2022, Broadcom had $31 billion in backlogged orders. Despite CEO Hock Tan not providing a recent update on the company's backlog, the flurry of order activity surrounding AI, as a whole, suggests it remains robust. A healthy backlog means dependable and predictable operating cash flow year after year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe Chief Customer & Technology Officer, Curtis Garner, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$10.0m worth of shares at a price of US$2,060 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$2,647. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 48% of Curtis Garner's holding.\n\nOver the last year we saw more insider selling of Chipotle Mexican Grill shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nInsiders At Chipotle Mexican Grill Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nWe've seen more insider selling than insider buying at Chipotle Mexican Grill recently. In that time, insiders dumped US$7.6m worth of shares. On the flip side, Independent Director Gregg Engles spent US$2.0m on purchasing shares (as mentioned above) . Generally this level of net selling might be considered a bit bearish.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Chipotle Mexican Grill insiders own 0.7% of the company, currently worth about US$503m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Chipotle Mexican Grill Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nUnfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Chipotle Mexican Grill stock, than buying, in the last three months. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But since Chipotle Mexican Grill is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill that deserve your attention before buying any shares.\n\nOf course Chipotle Mexican Grill may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Bill Ackman at the Legion of Honour Award Ceremony and Dinner for Olivia Tournay Flatto at the Park Avenue Armory on October 19, 2022 in New York City. Sylvain Gaboury/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images\n\nHedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman had a fruitful 2023 without doing much to his investment portfolio. With an gain of $610 million, or a return rate of 26.7 percent, the founder of the Pershing Square Capital Management was ranked No.7 on Bloomberg\u2019s annual list of the highest-earning hedge fund founders published yesterday (Feb. 20), his highest position ever. By percentage measure, Ackman outperformed Millennium Management\u2019s Israel Englander and Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin, the top two hedge fund managers on Bloomberg\u2019s list.\n\nAckman\u2019s investment portfolio consists of just eight stocks. Last year, with the exception of cutting back his bet on Lowe\u2019s, Ackman barely touched his other equity holdings.\u00a0In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman that aired yesterday, the investor revealed his process of researching companies and how he picks stocks to invest in.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Ackman\u2019s top holding was Chipotle (CMG), in which he began investing in 2016, shortly after the restaurant chain\u2019s stock tumbled following a major food safety scandal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great company, great concept\u2026but ultimately the company\u2019s lacking some of the systems and had a food safety issue,\u201d Ackman said on the Fridman podcast. \u201cBut the reality of the quick service industry is almost every fast food company has had a food safety issue over time. And the vast majority have survived.\u201d\n\nChipotle in 2016 perfectly fit Ackman's criteria for a publicly traded company worth investing in. \"The kind of business we\u2019re looking for is the kind of business everyone should be looking for, right? The problem is those companies tend to have very high stock prices,\" he said. \"So we get involved in cases where a great business has kind of made a big mistake or lost its way, but it\u2019s recoverable.\"\n\n\"We buy from shareholders who are disappointed, who\u2019ve lost confidence, selling at a low price relative to what it\u2019s worth if fixed,\" Ackman continued. \"And then we try to be helpful in fixing the company.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter becoming a shareholder, Ackman pushed Chipotle to move its headquarters to California from Colorado and name a new CEO, Brian Niccol, replacing its founder Steve Ells.\n\n\"Steve Ells, great entrepreneur. But business got to a scale he really couldn\u2019t run it,\" Ackman said. \"And sometimes one way to redo the culture of a company is just to move it geographically, and then you can reboot the business.\"\n\nHow Ackman researches a new company\n\nWhen doing research about a potential investment, Ackman said he usually starts with publicly available documents, such as a company's SEC filings and earnings call transcripts.\n\n\"It\u2019s very helpful to go back five years and learn the story,\" he said. \"Here\u2019s how management describes their business, here\u2019s what they say they\u2019re going to do. And you can follow along to see what they do. It\u2019s like a historical record of how competent and truthful they are.\"\n\nThen, he would look at the company's competitors and talk to experts to learn about the industry it operates in.\n\nAnd, of course, a prudent investor can't skip the step of analyzing the people behind a business. \"Understanding the people and what drives them, and what the actual financial and other incentives of a business, are very important part of the analysis for investing in a company,\" Ackman said. \"Part of it is how much are they running the business for the benefit of the business? How much are they running the business for the benefit of themselves? And that\u2019s the analysis you do.\"\n\n\"The top person matters enormously, and then it\u2019s who they recruit,\" he added. \"You recruit an A-plus leader and they\u2019re going to recruit other A- type people. You recruit a B- leader, you\u2019re not going to recruit any great talent beneath them.\"\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nMeta's A.I.

        "content": "The 0.7% month-over-month increase in Americans\u2019 spending at \u201crestaurants and bars\u201d last month was very encouraging for restaurant stocks. The data suggests that Americans continue to prioritize eating out even nearly two years after the lockdowns were terminated.\n\nOne factor behind the latter trend may be the large emphasis that millennials and Generation Z tend to place on great experiences. A related contributor could be the continued strength of travel trends in recent months. Also helping restaurant chains is the labor market which remains quite robust. Indeed, a very high and impressive 353,000 net nonfarm jobs were added to the economy last month. Of course, employed individuals are far more likely to eat often at restaurants than unemployed ones, and it appears that that the vast majority of Americans who want a job have one these days.\n\nGiven these points, it\u2019s a great time to acquire restaurant equities. Here are three of the best restaurant stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPotbelly Corporation (PBPB) An image of a sign of the green, yellow, black, and brown logo for \"Potbelly Sandwich Shop\" on a brick wall.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nPotbelly Corporation (NASDAQ:PBPB) issued a very positive preannouncement on Jan. 8. Specifically, the sandwich restaurant estimated that its same-store sales would jump a strong 5.9% to 6.4% year-over-year in Q4 versus its previous guidance of a 4% to 6% increase.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that it estimated that its systemwide sales had jumped 11% to 11.5% in Q4. And for all of 2023, its same-store sales soared 11.9%-12%.\n\nGiven all of this strong data, I think it\u2019s quite safe to say that PBPB is a major beneficiary of the strong demand for restaurant offerings in America.\n\nFinally and importantly, analysts on average expect the firm\u2019s earnings per share to climb to 25 cents this year from 16 cents in 2023, while the name is trading at a very low trailing price-to-sales ratio of 0.77 times.\n\nIn light of all of these points, I view PBPB as one of the best restaurant stocks to buy. PBPB has advanced 30% in the previous three months.\n\nStory continues\n\nShake Shak (SHAK) The Shake Shack (SHAK) on 125th Street in Harlem, New York City, USA\n\nSource: Here Now / Shutterstock.com\n\nGourmet hamburger restaurant chain Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) reported very strong fourth-quarter results on Feb. 15 as its system-wide sales soared 21.4% versus the same period a year earlier to $442 million, while its net income came in at $6.8 million, way better than the net loss of $7.76 million that it generated in Q4 of 2022.\n\nSHAK has been a major beneficiary of its launch of new stores and its deals with new franchisees in America, as it launched roughly 40 new locations last year and signed licensing deals with about the same number.\n\nThe company had about 600 owned or licensed locations in the U.S. as of last December while Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) had 3381 restaurants in America. So SHAK still can grow its top and bottom lines tremendously just by opening more stores.\n\nI also believe that the company\u2019s decision, announced during a conference in November, to devote more of its dollars to marketing in general and connected TV ads, in particular will bear fruit. The firm says that many Americans don\u2019t know about Shake Shack yet, so showing more ads could certainly boot its brand awareness and sales.\n\nAnd given the rapidly increasing popularity of streaming TV, particularly among the millennials and Generation Z members who tend to be big restaurant fans, I think that connected TV ads will prove to be very profitable for SHAK.\n\nSHAK has climbed 46% in the previous month.\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn line with my previous expectations, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), the owner of the Tim Hortons and Burger King chains, delivered strong 2023 results under the leadership of its executive chairman, Patrick Doyle. I was confident in Doyle because under his stewardship Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) carried out a tremendous turnaround in the 2010s, and it appears that he\u2019s working his magic again with QSR.\n\nAlso importantly, Restaurant Brands has developed a viable plan to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next decade.\n\nIn 2023, QSR\u2019s revenue jumped to $7.02 billion from $6.05 billion, while its operating income advanced to $2,14 billion from $2.02 billion. And last quarter, its comparable sales rose an impressive 6% versus the same period a year earlier.\n\nUnder the firm\u2019s long-term plan, Tim Hortons, known for its coffee, will add more lunch food to improve its afternoon sales, while also introducing more cold beverages.\n\nMeanwhile, Burger King\u2019s restaurants will be modernized and the marketing of the brand will be intensified.\n\nQSR has advanced nearly 25% since October.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Bill Ackman\u2019s Big Bet: The 3 Stocks That Make Up 46% of His Portfolio",
        "content": "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman became something of a household name a decade ago when he famously declared weight loss and nutrition supplement maker Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) a \u201cpyramid scheme.\u201d His Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund took a massive $1 billion short position in the stock.\n\nHe waged war on the company for five years before conceding his loss and closed out the short. Sometimes you have to accept economist John Maynard Keynes\u2019s maxim that regardless of your conviction, \u201cthe stock market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\u201d Not that Ackman or his hedge fund was ever at risk of going under, but you need to know when to walk away.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Ackman steered Pershing Square to some phenomenal gains. The fund has enjoyed 250% gains during that period compared to a 225% total return by the S&P 500. Last year the hedge fund returned 26.7%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBill Ackman stocks tend to be large-cap companies (it owns zero small-caps) that tend to be consumer cyclicals. Because he runs a concentrated portfolio with just 10 stocks, these are the three biggest bets in Pershing Square totaling 46% of the portfolio.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is the largest position Ackman has in Pershing Square, accounting for 18.1% of the total value. His 825,000 shares valued at $1.9 billion further position Ackman as the largest outside shareholder in the restaurant chain. Yet, he has also been selling down his stake.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Pershing cut its holdings in the Mexican food outlet by more than 13%. That followed a 7% reduction in the second quarter and could just represent Ackman taking profits on a stock he has owned since 2016. CMG stock is up 58% over the past year and is strongly gaining in 2024 with a near-14% start to the year. There\u2019s no reason to think Chipotle won\u2019t continue this torrid pace higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe restaurant operator saw strong growth in Q4, beating Wall Street expectations. It opened 271 locations last year, most of which featured its popular Chipotlanes drive-thru windows. The company believes as many as 1,000 locations could have a Chipotlane by the end of 2024. Geolocation data analytics firm Placer.ai says visits to Chipotle are picking up in the evening, suggesting consumers are choosing to eat dinner at the restaurant rather than as an on-the-go lunch break. Chipotle\u2019s lunch crowd visits haven\u2019t rebounded since the pandemic.\n\nA quality stock for years, CMG stock will likely remain a fixture in Ackman\u2019s portfolio for years to come.\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRestaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) is the owner of Burger King, Popeye\u2019s Louisiana Kitchen, Tim Horton\u2019s, and Firehouse Subs. It is the second-biggest position held by Ackman representing 17.6% of the total value.\n\nAckman holds 23.4 million shares valued at $1.9 billion. The stock is one of the oldest holdings in Pershing\u2019s account, and he\u2019s again the largest outside shareholder. Ackman first picked up QSR stock back in 2012.\n\nThe hedge fund operator likes the breadth of coverage Restaurant Brands offers in the quick-serve sector. He calls the company \u201ca high-quality, capital-light, growing annuity that generates high-margin brand royalty fees.\u201d Ackman has only minimally pared back his position in QSR stock but hasn\u2019t sold any for several quarters.\n\nThe Burger King chain is finally making a turnaround, which helped the Restaurant Brands beat analyst estimates in Q4. Tne company just bought back some 1,000 stores from its largest Burger King franchisee, Carrol\u2019s Restaurants (NASDAQ:TAST). RBI has over 31,000 restaurants in its portfolio but envisions growing it to 40,000 stores by 2028.\n\nThe restaurant operator remains on a growth trajectory even if buying out its franchisee reduces those annuity-like royalties Ackman enjoys so much.\n\nHilton Worldwide (HLT) the sign in front of a Hilton (HLT) hotel\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe third largest holding in Pershing Square\u2019s portfolio is hotelier Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT). Also, Ackman was a seller of HLT stock in the fourth quarter, reducing his stake to 9.2 million shares valued at $1.7 billion. The position represents 16.1% of the portfolio\u2019s total value.\n\nAckman had been a buyer of Hilton stock in the third quarter. He might have tried to take advantage of the travel rebound that is underway in the industry. But he cut the stock back to below where his holdings stood in Q2. Still, Hilton is performing quite well. Shares are up 30% over the past year and are 9% higher this year. HLT stock has gained over 250% since the low point hit when the Covid pandemic appeared.\n\nHilton is another \u201chigh-quality, asset-light, high-margin business\u201d that Ackman finds attractive. He likes that the hotel\u2019s net unit growth will accelerate this year until eventually achieving its historical 6% to 7% range. International growth will be an important driver for Hilton.\n\nRevenue per available room (revPAR), a key metric of the hospitality industry, is now above pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0 The stock is cheap at 24 times next year\u2019s earnings and Wall Street forecasts Hilton will expand profits at a 16% CAGR for the next five years. That\u2019s ahead of the 11% growth it experienced over the past five years. It makes Hilton Worldwide a good, long-term holding.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.'s (NYSE:CMG) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE:CMG) stock increased significantly by 18% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Chipotle Mexican Grill's  ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Chipotle Mexican Grill is:\n\n40% = US$1.2b \u00f7 US$3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.40.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's Earnings Growth And 40% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Chipotle Mexican Grill has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 36% net income growth seen by Chipotle Mexican Grill over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then compared Chipotle Mexican Grill's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 20% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Chipotle Mexican Grill is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs Chipotle Mexican Grill Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Chipotle Mexican Grill's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

However, brands like Chipotle (CMG) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) that appeal beyond just lower income groups had \"really healthy numbers.\"\n\nDunlop says two key factors are \"consumer health\" and brands being \"different operationally.\" Value-oriented names like Domino's (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) can withstand consumer cutbacks. Meanwhile, Dunlop expects outperformance from Starbucks (SBUX), McDonald's (MCD), and other chains boasting \"massive loyalty programs\" that offer \"personalized value\" to retain customers amid traffic declines.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith",

These types of stocks can reward long-term investors while having less volatility than most equities.\n\nWhile some blue-chip stocks fall behind the stock market in the long run, other blue-chip stocks continue to outperform. Investors looking for some promising investment opportunities may want to consider these picks.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has established itself as a healthier fast-food restaurant among the available choices. That branding choice helped the company reverse decelerating revenue growth and deliver an exceptional fourth quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuring\u00a0Q4 2023, the company increased revenue by 15.4% year-over-year. That\u2019s higher than the company\u2019s full-year revenue increase of 14.3% year-over-year. Chipotle also saw a 27.3% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share. Chipotle\u2019s $282.1 million in net income was enough to secure an 11.3% net profit margin.\n\nChipotle also opened 121 new restaurants. It\u2019s no surprise that 110 of those restaurants included a Chipotlane, which has been a growth driver for the company.\n\nChipotle has been a rewarded long-term pick for investors. The equity is up by 44% over the past year and has surged by 327% over the past five years. Shares of the fast food restaurant currently trade at a 47 forward P/E ratio.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft (MSFT) sign outside of office building\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a staple in many funds and continues to deliver exceptional returns for long-term investors. The stock has outperformed the market over the past year and over the past five years. It\u2019s a pivotal stock for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100.\n\nMicrosoft has several growth verticals that have consistently produced revenue growth and profits. The tech giant has meaningful exposure in cloud computing, social media, advertising, artificial intelligence, gaming, and other industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft delivered 18% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0Q2 FY24 with cloud revenue being a standout. That segment experienced 24% year-over-year revenue growth during the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft has been winning new customers by infusing artificial intelligence into its entire tech stack. For instance,\u00a0Copilot is an AI assistant that helps businesses and individuals navigate Microsoft Office products more efficiently.\n\nThe company\u00a0invested in a Super Bowl ad for Copilot which shows it is serious about its latest AI product.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Watch for Dips, Because Amazon Stock Is a Buy Amid the Market Chaos\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to grow at a fast pace. E-commerce sales showed resilience as the company reported a 14% year-over-year revenue increase in Q4 2023. Amazon Web Services also had a better quarter than the prior one and grew by 13% year-over-year.\n\nAmazon had a record-breaking holiday season and saw elevated growth in international markets. The company\u2019s generative AI capabilities offer an exciting growth opportunity. The company\u2019s\u00a0Bedrock makes it easier for developers to scale AI applications. This resource will increase demand for Amazon Web Services and can further fuel the stock.\n\nAmazon has been pacing the stock market with a 70% gain over the past year. Shares are up by 115% over the past five years. North American sales are still the\u00a0lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s total net sales. Amazon can still generate more growth by tapping into international markets. The company has exposure to multiple verticals and seems likely to reward long-term investors.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A Procter & Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) produces many essential home products and has a portfolio of household brands. The stock doesn\u2019t offer tremendous upside but is still respectable. Shares are up by 14% over the past year and have gained 60% over the past five years.\n\nWhile other companies can outperform PG stock, few equities can compare to the consumer goods company\u2019s dividend payouts. Procter & Gamble has been giving out dividends for\u00a0133 consecutive years. That includes 67 consecutive years of dividend hikes. The asset has a 2.40% dividend yield.\n\nProcter & Gamble reported mild earnings, which is to be expected from a mature blue-chip stock. Revenue increased by 3% year-over-year in\u00a0Q2 FY24 while core EPS increased by 16% year-over-year. These aren\u2019t groundbreaking gains, but they show that the company is still expanding its market share.\n\nThe company is more resilient during recessions since consumers will reduce other expenses before trimming essential products. It can be a useful equity for a conservative investor\u2019s portfolio.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) has been outperforming Visa (NYSE:V) in recent months. A meaningful rally has resulted in a 1-year gain of 25%. The stock has gained 106% over the past five years.\n\nThe credit and debit card firm reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Net income reached $2.8 billion, which represents an 11% year-over-year growth rate. Mastercard had higher revenue growth than Visa but lagged in net income growth. Both financial firms offer impressive growth rates.\n\nMichael Miebach, CEO of Mastercard, cited healthy consumer spending and strong growth in cross-border volume when commenting on earnings. Mastercard closed out 2023 by repurchasing $9.0 billion worth of shares and distributing $2.2 billion in dividends.\n\nMastercard\u2019s dividend yield is a low 0.60%, but\u00a0historical dividend growth has been incredible. The firm started 2024 by hiking its quarterly dividend from $0.57 per share to $0.66 per share. This growth is a 15.8% year-over-year increase.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a reliable retailer that is tapping into e-commerce and international markets for additional growth opportunities. E-commerce sales rallied by 15% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2023 while overall sales increased by 5.2% year-over-year.\n\nWalmart\u2019s e-commerce growth has been stronger in domestic markets while retail store revenue growth has been higher in international markets. The company\u2019s global advertising revenue jumped by 20% year-over-year. While this is an exciting development because of higher margins and a good growth rate, advertising makes up a small percentage of Walmart\u2019s total sales.\n\nWalmart offers lower volatility than most of the stock market because of its\u00a00.49 beta. The S&P 500 has a 1.00 beta. The company also offers more protection during a recession since the retailer specializes in offering affordable goods and services.\n\nThe stock can also rally when the economy is booming. Shares are up by 69% over the past five years.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983.

Shares are up by 37% over the past year and offer a 3.55% dividend yield.\n\nThe firm closed out the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023 with 4% year-over-year revenue growth. The company has experienced more demand for its hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence offerings.\n\nWhile other AI stocks have soared much higher than IBM, the company only trades at a 23 P/E ratio. The company\u2019s forward P/E ratio is currently 18.50. The reinvented company\u2019s net income increased by 14% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.\n\nIBM anticipates achieving mid-single-digit year-over-year revenue growth in 2024. The firm also expects to generate $12 billion in free cash flow. Other tech companies will outperform this stock and it is unlikely to outperform index funds. However, investors looking for more stability during economic uncertainty may want to consider this pick.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in MSFT.

For others, it continues a string of outperformance that analysts and investors have come to expect. Investors who take a position in a company that has just crushed its earnings print and whose share price is going parabolic can benefit from short-term profits or long-term gains. Here are three stocks to buy hand over fist after they posted blowout earnings.\n\nLyft (LYFT) Struggling for Support, Lyft Stock May Not Have Bottomed out Yet\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) rose 34% in a day after the ride-hailing and delivery company reported better-than-expected financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. Investors are cheering news that Lyft swung from a $416.5 million loss a year earlier to a profit of $222.4 million in the final quarter of last year. Lyft\u2019s stock initially rose more than 60% on news of the earnings release due to an accounting error by the company. While the share price moderated after the company\u2019s clarification, it\u2019s still up big.\n\nFor Q4, Lyft reported earnings per share (EPS) of 18 cents, which was more than double the profit of 8 cents expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the period totaled $1.22 billion, matching analysts\u2019 expectations. Lyft also provided bullish forward guidance, saying that it expects gross bookings for the current first quarter of 2024 will be $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion, topping estimates of $3.46 billion. With the big post-earnings move, LYFT stock is now up 50% in the last 12 months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s (NYSE:CMG) stock has been on an upswing ever since the company issued strong fourth-quarter financial results.

GOLD reported strong Q4 2023 financial results. The company managed to triple its profits and double its net income from a year earlier during the quarter. Barrick reported EPS of 27 cents for Q4 2023, beating analyst forecasts of 21 cents. Revenue of $3.06 billion slightly missed expectations of $3.14 billion.

In terms of guidance, Barrick said that it anticipates higher gold production this year as prices for the precious metal near record levels. Management said that they expect gold production to range between 3.9 million ounces and 4.3 million ounces this year. That compares with 4.05 million ounces in 2023.\n\nGold is currently trading right around $2,000 per ounce, which is not far from its all-time high of $2,135.39 an ounce. GOLD stock has declined 21% in the last 12 months, but looks to rebound after the strong Q4 print.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. Just think about the savvy investors who held Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) shares for the last five years, while they gained 338%. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 21% gain in the last three months. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 11% in 90 days).\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver half a decade, Chipotle Mexican Grill managed to grow its earnings per share at 48% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 34% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 58.47, the market remains optimistic.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Chipotle Mexican Grill shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 58% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 34% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the  1 warning sign  we've spotted with Chipotle Mexican Grill .\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

        "title": "11 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at 11 stocks that might be splitting soon. If you want to skip our overview of what a stock split is and some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon.\n\nWhen it comes to keeping investors happy, publicly traded stock managers have several options at their disposal. When it comes to investor expectations, the management strategy depends on the kind of stock. For value stocks, i.e. companies that seek to deliver share price and business stability by targeting well established markets, investors typically hope for dividends and the ability to hedge losses and growth drops during turbulence. Similarly, for growth stocks, the primary driver is, well, growth - both for the earnings per share and the share price.\n\nOne way in which a company can keep its share price stable over the long run and insulate it against sentiment driven volatility is by doing a stock split. A split, if you're unaware, is when a firm divides its shares into more shares. So a one for two split simply means that one share trading for $10 is now worth two shares worth $5 each and so on. The primary motivation for a stock split is management's aim to make the shares more tradeable, particularly for retail investors since a stock split makes the shares more affordable. Additionally, a stock split also increases liquidity, which makes for an overall healthier trading environment.\n\nStock splits are quite common in the stock market and nearly every mega cap stock available for trading today has used them in its history. For instance, one of the most valuable companies in the world, the Cupertino, California consumer technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gone through five stock splits in its history. The most recent Apple stock split came in 2020 as the world was reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Apple split a single share into four back then, and had the split not occurred and the shares had continued to appreciate by a similar percentage from then until now, then a single Apple share would currently be worth $744 right now. Apple's previous stock split before the 2020 split was a whopping 7 for 1 split in 2014, and cumulatively, as of February 2024, its shares have been divided into 168 components.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding on this, 2022 has been a busy year when it comes to mega cap stocks and stock splits. Big ticket names such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have all undergone stock splits which came right when the Federal Reserve was making preparations for lift off when it came to jacking up interest rates. Alphabet and Amazon both announced massive 20 for 1 stock splits in 2022, which was understandable since their shares were trading north of as much as $1,000 by then. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, market liquidity dries up and investors, both retail and institutional, find it hard to acquire capital to pile into stocks. Therefore, a stock split, which reduces the share price, encourages trading as a unit of a stock is now worth less in absolute dollar terms and can be bought relatively easily. Additionally, record share price gains during the coronavirus pandemic that saw investors flock to technology stocks due to their potential to capitalize from lock downs induced trend also pushed their share prices quite high and management thought it was best to bring it back to comfortable levels by splitting the shares.\n\nFast forwarding to 2024, the year has borne some fruit when it comes to big companies and stock splits. The start of the year has seen the world's largest brick and mortar retailer Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announce a stock split. Walmart's shares have reclaimed their all time high levels in 2024 after the firm beat analyst Q4 2023 earnings per share estimates and kept the foot on the pedal when it comes to growth by announcing new stores in its biggest market, the U.S. The firm also announced a three for one stock split that is set to go into effect into February 2024. At the heart of the decision is associate well being, argues Walmart, with its official release sharing that the decision is motivated by ensuring an affordable entry level share price for its Associate Stock Purchase Plan.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some stocks that are splitting soon. Some notable names are Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). 11 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon\n\nImage by moerschy from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that are splitting soon, we first made a list of all stocks that are going to split in February 2024, stocks trading above $1,000 and haven't split in decades, and large cap stocks with more than 100% share price gain over the past year.

These equities can keep up with the market and outperform it in some cases.\n\nBlue-chip stocks also bode well for long-term investors. They are often household names that continue to gain market share each year. Many of these companies make acquisitions and invest in new assets to increase shareholder value.\n\nInvestors can choose from many blue-chip stocks. However, you may want to add these three investment opportunities to your watchlist.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Moody\u2019s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.\n\nSource: Daniel J.

The company\u2019s analytics allow leaders to make data-backed decisions and navigate uncertainties within the market. The firm closed out the\u00a0third quarter of 2023 with 15% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth. Net income increased by 28% YOY during the quarter.\n\nThe corporation\u2019s recent quarter represents revenue acceleration. In the first nine months of the year, Moody\u2019s revenue growth only comes to 6%. Moody\u2019s President and CEO Rob Fauber credited the insurance segment\u2019s recovery and the team\u2019s resilience for the successful quarter.\n\nMoody\u2019s is working on a\u00a0generative AI assistant that will help clients.

The company has pristine profit margins and continues to grow its top and bottom lines.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa reported 9% YOY revenue growth and 17% YOY net income growth in the\u00a0first quarter of fiscal 2024. The firm trades at a 28-forward P/E ratio and has put its capital to use via share buybacks, dividend payouts, and acquisitions.\n\nVisa closed out the quarter with $3.4 billion in stock buybacks and still has $26.4 billion in remaining authorized funds to repurchase additional shares. Visa\u2019s dividend yield is low at 0.75% but the company\u2019s annual dividend growth rate is enticing.\n\nNear the end of 2023, Visa\u00a0hiked its quarterly dividend per share from 45 cents to 52 cents. That represents a 15.6% YOY increase. Investors can benefit from a healthy blend of cash flow and stock appreciation.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) offers enticing margins and growth for long-term investors. The company has been gaining market share for many years and looks poised to continue that trend.\n\nThe fast food restaurant reported 15.4% YOY revenue growth in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023 amid 121 new restaurant openings. Almost all of those restaurants have a Chipotlane, the company\u2019s mobile pickup order window.\n\nMost of its restaurants are located in the United States, but Chipotle is tapping into international markets for new growth opportunities. The company will soon have\u00a0more locations in the Middle East and is looking to build on its presence in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.\n\nChipotle has fewer than 50 restaurants in Europe and fewer than 50 restaurants in Canada. The restaurant chain has a lot of room for international expansion and is just getting started on this front.\n\nThese efforts can continue an impressive stock rally that has made many long-term investors happy.

        "title": "A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans",
        "content": "McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD) released its fourth-quarter 2023 earnings report on Feb. 5, causing a sell-off. And yet, at the time of writing, the stock was up 5.50% on a three-month basis even after a 3.73% drop.\n\nWhen we zoom out even further, the stock is up more than 200% over a 10-year period. The earnings drop could be justified as a mere technical retracement and profit trimming. Indeed, there is nothing in the earnings report that could directly or indirectly point to corporate mistakes or strategy errors. My investment thesis is the share price is now at an interesting entry point for prospective investors who missed the end of year stock rally given the unjustified stock drop, the attractive forward valuation, the new CosMc concept and the exciting implementation of artificial intelligence in the business.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MCD. A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans\n\nPullback Due To Earnings: An Opportunity To Jump On The Trade At The Last Hour\n\nLet us dive into the reported earnings. The earnings per share (EPS, which is the company's profit or net income per outstanding share) beat the Street's expectations by $0.13 to reach $2.95. This is an impressive 18% year-over-year (YoY) increase, especially for a corporation this large. The reason for the stock drop was the revenue disappointment: revenue missed expectations by $40m. That is a 0.6% miss considering the $6.41B revenue (up an impressive 8.1% YoY as well). Wall Street can be picky and the markets don't forgive even a slight miss. As mentioned, the miss is minimal from a quantitative perspective and couldn't possibly justify the erasal of $6bn of market cap; the nature of the miss may actually be of greater concern. Indeed, McDonald's is an international business with presence all-over the globe. Its ability to adapt its menus to local cultures has truly been the key to the business expansion on all continents, and support the continued growth of the company. Therefore, events outside of the U.S. could potentially have material impacts on the financials. When I looked into the quarterly same-store sales figures in the various regions, the U.S. saw an increase of 4.3% versus 4.45% expected while for the international figure the expectation was higher (4.79%) and missed severely by attaining only 3.4%. The international sales miss is what caused the stock to drop, and the main point of concern is the reason for international sales to drop: the situation in the Middle East, in particular the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's Israeli franchisee caused large controversy on social media after announcing its plans on Instagram to provide thousands of free meals to Israeli soldiers amidst the conflict with Hamas. The announcement was surprising because McDonald's has shown neutrality in conflicts over the years, key to being able to implement itself all around the globe with over 41,000 locations in more than 100 countries. The decision caused large boycotts in Muslim countries with large populations and growing markets, namely Malaysia and Indonesia. The boycott waves reached one of the largest and most profitable market as well, France.\n\nThe markets sold off the stock for a reason that is, in my opinion, a short-term circumstance and a short-lived event. Even if the boycotts were to continue, there is limited downside as it is unlikely they would intensify going forward (the peak of the boycotts were the days following the controversy). More importantly, McDonald's revenue depends less on its food sales than its real estate business and therefore, further downside from boycotts are mitigated. Harry J. Sonneborn, an early insider in McDonald's, once said, We (McDonald's) are not technically in the food business. We are in the real estate business. The only reason we sell fifteen-cent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue, from which our tenants can pay us our rent.\n\nMcDonald's is a real estate business first and foremost. Out of the 41,000 plus locations I mentioned earlier, only slightly over 2,000 are operated by the company itself (the remaining ones are operated by franchisees). The company provides the franchisees with the product that the latter will sell to pay the rent to the company. Rental income in 2021 exceeded one third of the total revenue and represented the main source of revenue of the fast-food chain. This is the real moat of the business in relation to its competitors. The premium valuation reflects the quality of the business.\n\nA great business with an attractive outlook reflected by a rich valuation\n\nCompared with the wider fast-food industry, where competitors like Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) operate, McDonald's is rather richly valued. Based on trailing multiples, the stock keeps getting valued more and more richly over time. A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans\n\nSource: TIKR.com\n\nTen years ago, the stock was valued at a total enterprise value of less than 4 times last 12 months revenue and around 10 times Ebitda. We are now at around double, meaning the stock has become twice more expensive than a decado ago. The reason for the growing valuation lies in its moat we discussed earlier. The company has successfully managed to mitigate the cyclical nature of its food business by the fixed part of revenue coming from the rental income of its franchisees. The company's growth prospects have also improved over the years, leading to a premium valuation on the multiples of revenue, Ebitda, earnings and free cash flow, which are all above the sector median. A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans\n\nSource: TIKR.com\n\nThe rich valuation is, in my opinion, also justified by exciting innovations. McDonald's has launched a new concept that has been implemented in a few locations in the U.S. and is named after a little-known mascot of the company from the 1980s: CosMc. This new chain, CosMc, is focused on beverages and snacks and clearly aims to become an undeclared competitor to Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) and Starbucks. The latter has been repeatedly criticized amidst a high inflationary environment to hike prices in an unbearable manner. CosMc has proven to be a huge success in its first open locations: the store has seen the triple amount of visitors per square foot than an average McDonald's restaurant.\n\nLast but not least, another exciting innovation is underway with regard to artificial intelligence. McDonald's announced in December a partnership with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google to gradually roll out an AI system throughout 2024 in the U.S. For now, the project is rather secretive with little publicly available information on the project. McDonald's has so far only declared that the aim is to provide to its customers hotter, fresher food and help managers quickly spot and enact solutions to reduce business disruptions. We can assume the AI system will help with orders, perhaps faster processing of orders and also in some ways cover for missing staff. It is not impossible that the implementation of AI could reduce the number of employed workers, leading to increased profitability. These innovations are still in the implementation phase and their positive impact could take months or even years to be reflected in the financials. What is certain is the revenue growth prospects and earnings per share growth estimates continue to improve, as shown below. A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans\n\nCosMc and AI are likely to boost revenue growth with a significant outperformance relative to the trendline. A Look at McDonald's Delicious Fundamentals, CosMc Project and AI Plans\n\nThe earnings per share is also expected to outperform the 10-year trendline.\n\nThese events could invalidate my bull case\n\nDespite these great prospects and the fundamentals, my bullish case could be invalidated if McDonald's turns too political. Indeed, the business has been able to expand its presence, making it an unmatched brand - except perhaps by Yum's KFC - because of its ability to adapt to local cultures and consistently brushing off any involvement in geopolitical discussions.\n\nAdditionally, the new CosMc pilot project and the Google AI partnership are too uncertain to model any increase in cash flow projections in 2024. If they turn out to not be profitable, one or both projects could be a source of increased expenses in 2024.\n\nBottom line\n\nMcDonald's is a great business that is valued at a premium to the restaurant industry. In my view, the earnings do not justify the drop the stock has suffered, and therefore presents an excellent opportunity to initiate a position or continue accumulating shares. Despite the cyclical nature of the business, the continuous growth of the number of franchisees and the rental income stemming from them provide a reliable base to the financial health of the company. Exciting pilot projects like CosMc and the Google AI partnership provide comfort that the stock will likely continue being valued richly and the business will continue growing in the years to come.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

TipRanks analysts give DPZ a moderate buy rating, with a 3.10% upside potential, reflecting confidence in Domino\u2019s strategic direction.\n\nU.S. Foods Holding Corp.

With a snappy network of over 6,000 suppliers and around 70 distribution facilities, USFD ensures that everything from prime cuts to fresh produce reaches restaurants, hospitals, and more. Its logistical prowess has translated into a relatively impressive 2.1% year-over-year increase in net sales and a savory 17.14% uptick in adjusted EBITDA.\n\nMoreover, its profitability has been impressive, with its EBITDA mushrooming by a whopping 47.57% year-over-year, dwarfing the sector\u2019s 7.32% median. Furthermore, its revenue forecasts are just as appetizing, with an 8.20% growth rate nearly doubling the sector\u2019s average. These numbers are telling, which is why it\u2019s earned a moderate buy rating from Tiprank\u2019s analysts, with them expecting a 12% upside in its stock from current levels.\n\nChiptole Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is redefining the fast-food landscape with its commitment to healthier options and sustainable practices, illustrated by a notable 64.19% stock increase over the past year. The introduction of an all-electric restaurant design underscores Chipotle\u2019s dedication to energy efficiency and a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nFurthermore, Chipotle\u2019s strategic investments in Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity through the $50 million Cultivate Next venture fund highlight its push toward sustainable farming. Leveraging AI and robotics, Greenfield Robotics aims to revolutionize regenerative agriculture by minimizing herbicide usage and enhancing soil health.\n\nFinancially, CMG reported a robust revenue increase of 15.6% year-over-year to $2.52 billion and earnings-per-share of $10.36, surpassing expectations. The opening of 121 new restaurants and the anticipation of 285 to 315 new openings in 2024 reflect a strong growth trajectory. TipRanks analysts echo this optimism, giving CMG a moderate buy rating with a 3.65% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Feast on Profits: 3 Fast Food Stocks Cooking Up Hot Gains",
        "content": "The fast-food scene seems to be an intriguing place to invest these days with reasonable valuations and fairly defensive growth prospects. With a growing number of firms looking to feast on the profits from the booming market, not all fast-food firms are destined to reward their shareholders with returns above the market averages.\n\nThe firms that can grab more market share are worthy of a higher price tag. When it comes to growth in the fast-food world in the modern age, it\u2019s more than just about digitization, delivery and drive-thru, three traits that were the keys to success during the early days of the COVID pandemic.\n\nLooking ahead, restaurant modernization, automation and menu innovation could be the three keys to grabbing more share of the quick-serve restaurant market. Let\u2019s check in with three fast food stocks that look good to go in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) nosedived following the release of some distasteful quarterly earnings that saw some consumers shy away from the burger giant in favor of some good, old-fashioned home cooking. Once thought of as relatively inflation-resilient, it now seems that McDonald\u2019s has jacked up prices a tad too far, such that consumers have put their wallets away. Additionally, the value menu does not quite offer the same value proposition it used to, not after the storm of inflation.\n\nAt this juncture, it seems like McDonald\u2019s may be inclined to return to its value roots by addressing some of its consumers\u2019 affordability concerns. A viral photo of a $18 Big Mac meal is not doing McDonald\u2019s any favors on social media, especially as a fast-food firm that used to pride itself on food that\u2019s both tasty and affordable.\n\nI think it\u2019s clear that McDonald\u2019s overestimated the strength of its \u201cpricing power\u201d muscle. And now, it needs to beckon consumers back with better deals, new menu offerings and freshly renovated stores. A bit of automation couldn\u2019t hurt either, as firms beyond tech look to grab what AI has to offer.\n\nStory continues\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) had delivery down well before many of its peers in the affordable fast-food scene. Though peers, especially those outside the pizza market, have since caught up, I\u2019d argue that pizzas remain one of the better items to have delivered straight to your door. Pizza pies seem to be immune from the \u201csog\u201d effect, something that french fries from the local burger joint may succumb to on those lengthy rides over from the restaurant.\n\nAs Domino\u2019s looks to move on from an underwhelming past two years that saw shares actually fall by just over 3%, investors ought to be enticed by what the pizza chain has in store in 2024. The company is serious about clawing at the share of its competitors in the pizza world and has plans to get the job done. Specifically, the firm wants to open more corporate stores while expanding its footprint internationally.\n\nInternational growth could be where it\u2019s at as the company looks to repeat the success it enjoyed domestically. As to whether the effort will cook up hot gains this year remains to be seen. At 29.1 times trailing price-to-earnings, I do like the price of admission.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava (NYSE:CAVA) is a lightweight in the restaurant scene with a modest $6 billion market cap. The Mediterranean restaurant chain recently received a \u201ctop pick\u201d rating from Baird. The firm views Cava as having \u201cmany of the same attributes\u201d that helped make Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) one of the firm\u2019s best growth picks. I think Baird is right to hold Cava stock in such high regard.\n\nUndoubtedly, Cava does seem to take a few pages out of an early-stage Chipotle\u2019s playbook. On the whole, Mediterranean food is quite fresh and healthy (like Chipotle\u2019s Mexican offerings), allowing it to gain from the secular tailwind of health and wellness.\n\nAdditionally, Cava is a small fish in a massive market that\u2019s ripe for disruption from new up-and-comers. All considered, Cava is a new-age growth play for those looking to play a different angle on the quick-serve restaurant scene.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of McDonald\u2019s.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look atJim Cramer's 11 Latest Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 5 Latest Stock Picks.\n\nJim Cramer examined the recent market movements during his program on CNBC on February 10. Cramer said the market has been up for 14 out of the last 15 weeks. Cramer said this hasn\u2019t happened since 1972.\u00a0 He thinks amid strong earnings and rate cuts on the horizon, investors have learned that you are much better off \"owning stocks\" instead of trading them. Cramer said he's long been a believer of owning stocks and holding them for long periods of time. Cramer talked about the recent market rally and said it would take something really \"nasty\" to stop this rally.\n\nWhat is the Best Time to Buy Stocks?\n\nCramer said the best time to own stocks is between the Fed's last rate hike and the first cut. Cramer said that it would make sense for the Fed to postpone rate cuts amid inflation and investors can skill take benefit from strong earnings and rally in stocks.\n\n\"Authentic Stupidity\"\n\nCramer recently also talked about a trend which he calls \"authentic stupidity\" where some stocks that should go higher are either going down or unable to realize their true potential. Cramer believes Apple is one of the victims of this authentic stupidity. Cramer quoted a \"nameless analyst\" from DA Davidson who in January gave a $166 price target to Apple and a Neutral rating, citing lack of innovation. Cramer said the same analyst, after the launch of Apple's Vision Pro, upped his price target on Apple shares to $200 and said \"game changing innovation is back.\" Jim Cramer's Latest Stock Picks\n\nEveryone knows Cramer is bullish on mega-cap quality tech stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). But what are his latest stock picks? For this article we watched Cramer's latest programs and picked some new stocks on the analyst's radar. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nStory continues\n\n11. Enphase Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 40\n\nJim Cramer believes Enphase\u00a0Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH), which is down about 42% over the past one year, might finally be bottoming. Cramer said Enphase\u00a0Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH)\u00a0suffered because of rising interest rates since the residential solar industry was highly reliant on financing. Cramer quoted Enphase\u00a0Energy Inc's (NASDAQ:ENPH)\u00a0CEO Badri Kothandaraman who recently said in Enphase\u00a0Energy Inc's (NASDAQ:ENPH)\u00a0fourth quarter earnings call that things are expected to start turning around for Enphase\u00a0Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH)\u00a0in the first quarter.\n\nCramer specifically highlighted the following comments of the CEO:\n\n\"We think Q1 could be the bottom quarter. Europe is already showing early signs of recovery, and we expect the non-California states to bounce back quickly.\"\n\nEnphase also talked about Q1 guidance during its call:\n\n\"Let\u2019s now come to our Q1 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $260 million to $300 million. We expect the sell-through of our products to be seasonally down in Q1. We plan to undership to the end market demand for our products by approximately $130 million in Q1. We are forecasting to undership in Q2 as well, although at a much reduced level, and expect the channel to be normalized by the end of Q2. Let\u2019s talk about new products, starting with IQ batteries. Our sell-through for batteries has been increasing steadily over the last few quarters. Our third-generation battery delivers the best power specs and commissioning times of any Enphase battery today at a 15-year industry-leading warranty. The battery adoption rates are on the rise globally and we are well positioned to grow our battery sales in 2024.\"\n\nYou can read the entire earnings call transcript of Enphase by clicking here.\n\n10. Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 49\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on asset management and financial services company Oxford Lane Capital Corp (NASDAQ:OXLC). Cramer advised against buying the stock as he said we don\u2019t know \"what they own.\" Cramer said he likes \"the concept\" of the industry and in this regard recommended investors to buy Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX) instead.\n\n\"They really know how to do it,\" Cramer said.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 49 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX). The biggest stake in Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX) is owned by Thomas Steyer's Farallon Capital which owns a $239 million stake in Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX).\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for\u00a0Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) and Brookfield because we believe both companies are likely to increase market share in a secular growth opportunity for alternative assets.\n\nInstitutional allocations to alternative investment assets such as real estate, infrastructure, and private equity are likely to continue to grow significantly in the years ahead because alternatives have a long track record of generating attractive relative and absolute returns with less volatility than several other investment options.\n\nWe are bullish on the long-term prospects for Blackstone and Brookfield. Both companies are led by exceptional management teams that attract and retain exceptional talent. They are two of the largest real estate managers in the world with impressive investment track records. Both Blackstone and Brookfield have global franchises, strong brands, and loyal customers.\n\nWe believe the shares of both companies are attractively valued and are optimistic about the long-term potential for the Fund\u2019s investments in both companies.\u201d\n\n9. Hawkins Inc (NASDAQ:HWKN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nSpecialty chemicals and ingredients company Hawkins Inc (NASDAQ:HWKN) ranks ninth in our list of the best stocks to buy now according to Jim Cramer.\u00a0 A questioner recently asked Jim Cramer whether she should buy more Hawkins Inc (NASDAQ:HWKN) shares. Cramer said the answer is \"Yes.\" Cramer believes the water chemicals business had a tough year in 2023 but he sees only good times ahead for the sector.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Hawkins Inc (NASDAQ:HWKN), compared to just seven hedge funds in the previous quarter. This shows a major increase in hedge fund sentiment.\n\nA total of 18 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Hawkins Inc (NASDAQ:HWKN) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\n8. Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on insurance company Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL). Cramer said the stock is a Buy. Cramer thinks Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) shares should be bought because the insurance industry is thriving.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL).\n\nIn addition to Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), Cramer is also bullish on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\n7. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nJim Cramer recently praised Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) earnings on Twitter as well as during his program on CNBC. Cramer said that investors were wrong to be wary of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) . During the fourth quarter Chipotle's adjusted EPS came in at $10.36, beating estimates by $0.63. Revenue in the quarter jumped 15.6% year over year to $2.52 billion, beating estimates by $30 million. Comparable sales jumped 8.4%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 57 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) . The biggest stake in the company is owned by Bill Ackman's Pershing Square which owns a $1.7 billion stake in the company.\n\nClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn the consumer discretionary sector,\u00a0Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) proved a detractor as investors were disappointed in management\u2019s decision not to push additional menu pricing, which resulted in full year guidance falling short of expectations. However, we believe this is just a timing mismatch as their value proposition relative to peers leaves room for continued strong pricing power.\u201d\n\n6. Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 63\n\nJim Cramer was asked about his thoughts on home construction company Lennar Corp\u00a0(NYSE:LEN)\u00a0in a latest program. Cramer said Lennar Corp\u00a0(NYSE:LEN)\u00a0is \"so good\" and praised Lennar Corp's (NYSE:LEN)\u00a0leadership.

        "title": "3 Incredible Stocks That Could Supercharge Your Portfolio in 2024",
        "content": "There was excitement on Wall Street when the S&P 500 hit a new high in January after more than two years. But the real story is that it keeps moving up. There's momentum in the stock market, and with several positive market indicators, there could be high gains this year.\n\nIf you want to maximize your portfolio this year, choose solid stocks with high growth potential. MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG), and On Holding(NYSE: ONON) are three great picks.\n\n1. MercadoLibre: The other e-commerce leader\n\nMercadoLibre is an e-commerce giant in Latin America that consistently reports high growth. It also has a fintech division that offers digital payments and credit products, and together these make for a growth machine that's hard to compete with.\n\nThe e-commerce business is the older and core business, but the newer payment and credit categories are growing much faster. In the 2023 third quarter, gross merchandise volume accelerated to 69% over the previous year, and items sold increased 26%. It has industry-leading delivery times, with 80% of all orders in Q3 delivered within 48 hours throughout its vast system. More suppliers are joining MercadoLibre's distribution network, and its managed network increased from 91.9% to 94.2% in Q3. The more orders going through its system, the faster it can get them to customers.\n\nSince MercadoLibre serves 18 different Latin American countries, its business is well-diversified. Argentina has historically been its biggest market, but due to volatility in its economy, growth decelerated to 22% year over year in Q3 in that market. However, growth in Brazil is accelerating, with a 66% increase in sales, and Mexico came in at 40%.\n\nIn fintech, total payment volume (TPV) increased 121% year over year, with off-platform TPV up 145%. That represents the company's fastest-growing segment, and it has a huge opportunity as it powers digital payments for all kinds of transactions off the MercadoLibre platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs inflation looks like it's moderating and spending is healthy, 2024 is set to be another outstanding year for MercadoLibre. In the long term, it has a huge opportunity.\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill: A forever stock\n\nFans can't seem to get enough of Chipotle Mexican Grill's fresh and \"real\" ingredients. Chipotle consistently reports higher revenue, comparable sales, and profits, and it has continued this performance despite inflation.\n\nThe 2023 fourth quarter was another excellent show. Revenue increased 15% over last year, driven by an 8% increase in comparable sales, which is a key telling factor about a popular, well-run operation with future opportunity.\n\nOperating margin expanded from 13.6% last year to 14.4% this year. Restaurant-level operating margin was 25.4%, up from 24% last year. Earnings per share (EPS) rose from $8.02 to $10.21.\n\nChipotle already runs almost 3,500 restaurants, but it sees the opportunity for 7,000, and it opened 121 new stores in Q4 2023 alone. It has a robust omnichannel system, and 110 of its new stores feature a drive-thru, or \"Chipotlane.\" That's a primary element of its growth strategy.\n\nChipotle was a pioneer of the fast-casual dining trend, and its premium food and pricing have been a hit with its affluent clientele. That's been a crucial aspect of the company's ability to withstand inflation and continue demonstrating high growth. It has successfully raised prices to meet rising costs without missing a beat.\n\nChipotle is coming into 2024 in an excellent position, but it's really a forever stock that has rewarded shareholders for years and should continue to do so.\n\n3. On Holding: The newest name in premium activewear\n\nIf you haven't heard of On yet, get ready for the newest brand name in athletic wear. On has exploded onto the sneaker scene and developed a huge fan base that swears by its footwear and is willing to pay premium prices for its comfort technology, CloudTec. The Swiss-headquartered company is reporting incredible growth despite the economic climate, and it should only improve when the economy does.\n\nIn Q3 2023, sales increased 47% year over year and 57% for the trailing nine months. On's building a strong brand through its direct-to-consumer channels, which increased 55% in Q3, driving higher total growth. Its resilience and high prices drive margin expansion and profits, and it raised its full-year outlook for sales and gross margin.\n\nOn is still a small company, with $1.9 billion in trailing 12-month sales. It has barely penetrated many markets, including the U.S., where it has only 9% brand penetration. But where On does have a brand presence, it's growing fast. It demonstrated an 82% compound annual growth rate in the U.S over the past two years. It's quickly making a name for itself, with web site visits in 2023 up 129% versus 2021.\n\nThis is still an early stage opportunity, and On stock is down from its first-day closing price. It could soar this year, and it presents a rare long-term opportunity.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Super Bowl LVIII: The top food and drink stocks in focus, from PepsiCo to Chipotle",
        "content": "This Super Bowl weekend, investor eyes may not just be on football \u2014 they will be looking at food and drink stocks for opportunities for their portfolio.\n\nIn notes to clients and in conversations with Yahoo Finance, analysts shared their thoughts on companies whose drinks and snacks will be at parties throughout the US this Sunday.\n\nStarting with soda, which market research firm Numerator said is the most popular beverage for Super Bowl celebrations, it'll be a battle between PepsiCo (PEP), Coca-Cola (KO), and Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP).\n\nBut the two famous brands will be the best picks, said Morningstar analyst Dan Su, who projects that Coke and PepsiCo have long-term competitive advantages over their rivals in the next 20 years.\n\nBank of America also has Buy ratings on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, given they are high-quality, multinational businesses that can generate sustainable returns, analyst Bryan Spillane told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInvestors are looking for \"sales and volume growth\" in the space, and though the two tend to be neck and neck, Coca-Cola sales will likely outpace PepsiCo in 2024, Spillane predicted.\n\nWhile half of Super Bowl watchers will buy soda before the event, according to Numerator, another 37% will get beer, and 22% will stock up on spirits.\n\nThe beer industry had an up and down 2023, and the big three producers, AB InBev (BUD), Molson Coors (TAP), and Constellation Brands (STZ), will be looking to play offense.\n\n\"It's this whole dynamic about the three of them colliding at the Super Bowl,\" Spillane said. Molson Coors is looking to hold onto the gains it made during the Bud Light boycotts. On the other hand, Bud maker AB InBev has been running an ad campaign with NFL Hall of Famers Peyton Manning and Emmitt Smith as it looks for a comeback.\n\nBut Constellation Brands may have already won the battle, as Mexican import beers keep gaining in popularity, per Spillane.\n\nThe beverage giant, and others with Mexican import brands, could make further headway this year, said Bump Williams of Bump Williams Consulting.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We've already seen retailers in the back half of '23 give more shelf space to these brands in this segment,\" Williams told Yahoo Finance. \"We're going to continue to see that probably expand more as the spring sets get launched in March, April [2024].\"\n\nFor those looking at another area of the liquor shelf, tequila has been having a moment.\n\nIn a note to clients, Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein noted volumes for the liquor are seeing \"notable\" strength, up 7.2% year over year. Diageo (DEO), which owns Casamigos and Don Julio, led the pack with a 15.7% volume growth.\n\nWhat's a game without chip and dip? The big brands will likely benefit, as people are \"probably not going to buy private label\" for the big occasion, Mizuho Securities managing director John Baumgartner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFor Baumgartner, his top picks include Kraft Heinz (KHC), based on its \"indulgent snacks,\" as well as Mondel\u0113z International (MDLZ), for its cookie and cracker offerings.\n\nKraft Heinz is also a pick for Bank of America analyst Peter Galbo. One big reason: Velveeta. (Ever try Velveeta with Rotel? This reporter hasn't but plans to this Super Bowl).\n\nFor fans of wings, check out Pilgrim's Pride (PPC), said Galbo.\n\n\"They're the second largest chicken company in the US. ... They produce a lot of wings, as does Tyson, but historically, Pilgrim's Pride has been a better operator and better fundamentals,\" he said.\n\nWhile the Super Bowl won't give retailers a meaningful bump, Costco (COST) and Walmart (WMT) are good bets as consumers search for value in 2024.\n\n\"Walmart and Costco are two that are well positioned to benefit over the next 12 to 18 months,\" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe told Yahoo Finance. Branding and snacks are spotted at Taste of the NFL during Super Bowl weekend at Chateau Luxe on February 11, 2023, in Phoenix, Arizona. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for GENYOUth) (Tasos Katopodis via Getty Images)\n\nOrdering in? Morningstar Sean Dunlop suggested YUM! Brands (YUM), which owns KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, is the best among pizza and wings chains.\n\n\"Chipotle also does surprisingly good Super Bowl business, historically,\" said Dunlop, as Chipotle's takeout and delivery business lends itself to group parties.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Earnings Update: Here's Why Analysts Just Lifted Their Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) Price Target To US$2,703",
        "content": "It's been a good week for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest yearly results, and the shares gained 6.3% to US$2,638. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$9.9b and statutory earnings per share of US$44.34. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\n\nView our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nAfter the latest results, the 29 analysts covering Chipotle Mexican Grill are now predicting revenues of US$11.2b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a decent 14% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to ascend 18% to US$52.82. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$11.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$53.14 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nWith the analysts reconfirming their revenue and earnings forecasts, it's surprising to see that the price target rose 11% to US$2,703. It looks as though they previously had some doubts over whether the business would live up to their expectations. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Chipotle Mexican Grill analyst has a price target of US$3,100 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$1,950. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Chipotle Mexican Grill'shistorical trends, as the 14% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 15% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 9.9% annually. So although Chipotle Mexican Grill is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for Chipotle Mexican Grill going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nYou still need to take note of risks, for example - Chipotle Mexican Grill has  1 warning sign  we think you should be aware of.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Chipotle\u2019s CFO on burrito season, the right amount of guac\u2014and why a price hike is coming to California",
        "content": "Good morning. Chipotle Mexican Grill customers have a hankering for burritos and burrito bowls, and more of them are coming in person to get them.\n\nThe fast-casual restaurant reported earnings this week for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending Dec. 31. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of 15.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Comparable restaurant sales increased 8.4% from the same time a year ago, driven by a 7.4% increase in foot traffic and an increase in average check of 1%. This all contributed to a boost in total revenue. The company had fourth-quarter net income of $282.1 million, up from $223.7 million the same time last year.\n\nWhat\u2019s causing the boost in foot traffic? \u201cWe had to basically get back to our standards of running great restaurants,\u201d Jack Hartung, CFO and administrative officer at Chipotle told me.\n\nDuring the pandemic, much of the business was digital, and it was difficult to get the right number of crew members to come in, he said. For the past 18 months, the team has been working on returning to best practices. \u201cThat means having a team that's fully staffed, making sure you've got the right number of people deployed on the front line, making sure you don't run out of things like chips, and you've got enough guacamole for the day.\u201d The teams have been highly effective in making sure that there\u2019s enough chips and enough food prepped in the morning, he said.\n\nHartung also attributes traffic to what he said is the restaurant\u2019s value proposition of quality food made from fresh ingredients. \u201cIt's hard to find an entree for lunch or for dinner of the quality you get at a Chipotle for under 10 bucks,\u201d he said.\n\nHartung did note that Chipotle \u201ccosts a little bit more than traditional fast food.\u201d (Well, maybe not since a McDonald's Big Mac meals are priced at nearly $18 at some locations.)\n\nChipotle attracts customers across income levels, he said. \u201cWe have increased customer visits at the lowest income level that we track, under $40,000 [a year.]\u201d Hartung said. The other yearly income ranges tracked are from $40,000 to $100,000,\u00a0from $100,000 to $150,000 and over $150,000. \u201cEvery single income level came to us more often,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn October Chipotle raised prices by 3% after pausing hikes for over a year. I asked Hartung if he foresees any price hikes this year as it\u2019s uncertain when the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. \u201cWe don't have any current plans to raise prices right now,\u201d he told me. But there\u2019s one exception.\n\n\u201cWe do, in California, have a very significant increase in our wages coming up, and it's going to be in the ballpark of a 20% increase due to the FAST Act,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is likely to lead to some pricing action, but only in California.\u201d The FAST Act, California\u2019s new minimum wage law, which goes into effect in April, pays fast food workers $20 an hour.\n\nPositioned for growth\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, Chipotle opened 121 new restaurants with 110 locations including a Chipotlane\u2014a digital order drive thru pick-up lane. What\u2019s Hartung\u2019s advice about growth during uncertain times? \u201cMake sure you're constantly working on strengthening and protecting your unit economic model,\u201d he said. At Chipotle, that means building a business around transaction growth because that strengthens the company\u2019s margins and returns, he said. And at Chipotle, technology plays a role as well, Hartung said.\n\n\u201cTechnology investments need to be made over a long period of time, but the right investments will lead to better productivity and results in the restaurant,\u201d he said. For example, Chipotle is investing in Hyphen, an automated assistant or a \u201ccollaborative robot\u201d currently being fine-tuned to work alongside human employees to help prepare burrito bowls and salads.\n\nThe company announced last month that it\u2019s staffing up for \u201cburrito season,\u201d adding as many as 19,000 employees, which would be about five or six additional people per restaurant. Isn\u2019t burrito season every season at Chipotle? Well, technically, yes. However, \u201cwe call it burrito season affectionately, as it's when the weather starts to get nice, especially in more of the northern climates around mid-March, and that's when our sales really start to pick up,\u201d Hartung said.\n\nHave a good weekend.\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 9, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, Toyota Motor Corp. TM, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG and Carrier Global Corp. CARR.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Microsoft, Exxon Mobil and Toyota\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +54.0%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues have been driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\r\n\r\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continues to increase due to strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, More Personal Computing revenues are suffering from continued weakness in Windows and Devices businesses. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues. Also, declining gaming revenues has been a headwind. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Exxon Mobil have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-7.5% vs. -3.5%). The company is lagging its peers when it comes to shareholders\u2019 returns. The energy giant\u2019s financials were weakened by years-long significant spending on low-return developments and the coronavirus pandemic. Also, high input cost is hurting refining operations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. In Stabroek Block, located offshore Guyana, ExxonMobil has made many major discoveries that significantly improve its production outlook.\r\n\r\nThe advantaged growth projects of Guyana have lower greenhouse gas intensity than most of the oil and gas-producing resources across the globe. ExxonMobil\u2019s deal to acquire Pioneer Natural will bolster its presence in the prolific Permian Basin.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\r\n\r\nToyota Motor\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past year (+56.5% vs. +38.2%). The company\u2019s continued demand for vehicles and a robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles are set to fuel Toyota\u2019s sales volumes.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese auto giant aims to generate 40% of its global sales from electric vehicles by 2025 and 70% by 2030. It plans to invest 4 trillion yen ($35 billion) for a lineup of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. For fiscal 2024, Toyota projects vehicle sales of 9.6 million units, indicating an increase from 8.82 million units sold in fiscal 2023. Its investor-friendly moves also spark optimism.\r\n\r\nHowever, commodity cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on the company\u2019s margins. High capex and R&D expenses on the development of electric and autonomous vehicles are likely to dent its near-term margins and cash flows. The stock warrants a cautious stance at present.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Toyota Motor here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. and Carrier Global Corp.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

(5:00) - Is The Technology Industry The Place To Start Buying? (15:15) - Where Should You Be Looking To Invest Outside of Technology Growth? (29:30) - Episode Roundup: VRT, NVDA, LLY, CMG, DECK Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to talk about buying a stock when it\u2019s at all-time highs. Should you buy on the break out or wait for a pullback?\n\nBuying a stock after it\u2019s taken off and is making new highs is very difficult for many investors, emotionally. Some think it\u2019s too late or that the stock must be due for a pull back. Many think they have \u201cmissed\u201d the run.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s up big, for example, it has doubled in 6 months, how much more does it have left in the tank?\n\nBuying at the highs seems risky.\n\nThe Chart Versus the Fundamentals\n\nThe first question an investor should ask is if they are buying this stock as an investment, for the long-term, or a trade, for the short-term. What is the goal?\n\nSome will trade the chart, by using the 50 or 200-day moving averages or other technicals. Others will buy based on the fundamentals.\n\nTracey looked at the fundamentals for these 5 stocks. She is a value investor and is buying for the long-term.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat does the earnings outlook look like on these red-hot stocks?\n\n5 Stocks at All-Time Highs: Should You Buy?\n\n1. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nNVIDIA is seemingly hitting new all-times high nearly every day in 2024. Shares of NVIDIA are up 42.5% year-to-date. And over the last year, they\u2019ve soared 234%.\n\nOn the chart, the shares appear to be going \u201cvertical.\u201d NVIDIA, however, trades with a forward P/E of just 34. Earnings are expected to jump 268% in fiscal 2024 and another 63% in fiscal 2025.\n\nDo NVIDIA\u2019s fundamentals support buying at the highs?\n\n2. Eli Lilly and Co. LLY\n\nEli Lilly shares have been red-hot over the last year as the possibility of big sales from weight loss drugs became a reality. Shares are up 115% over that time and have gained 24.4% in 2024 alone.\n\nEarnings are also expected to soar, up 97% in 2024 and another 43% in 2025. But the shares remain expensive, even as earnings are growing, with a forward P/E of 56.6.\n\nIs Eli Lilly simply too hot to handle now or has the growth only just begun?\n\n3. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill busted out to new all-time highs on yet another earnings beat. Shares are up 16.6% year-to-date. Over the last year, shares of Chipotle have surged 57%.\n\nChipotle\u2019s earnings are expected to rise 18% in 2024 and another 19.2% in 2025. But even with the earnings on the rise, the shares are not cheap. Chipotle trades with a forward P/E of 47.\n\nHow much are you willing to pay for Chipotle\u2019s double-digit earnings growth?\n\n4. Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK\n\nDeckers Outdoor, the maker of popular brands UGG and Hoka, just posted another big beat on earnings. Shares hit new all-time highs in 2024, gaining 25% year-to-date. Over the last year, shares of Deckers Outdoor are up 100%.\n\nDeckers trades with a forward P/E of 31. Earnings are expected to jump 37.3% in fiscal 2024 and 11% in fiscal 2025.\n\nShould investors buy Deckers on future double-digit earnings growth and its powerful brands?\n\n5. Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT\n\nVertiv is in the data center industry and, in 2023 and 2024, that means the stock is red-hot. Shares are up 327% over the last year and have tacked on 26.5% year-to-date.\n\nEarnings are expected to jump 228% in 2023 and another 27.6% in 2024 but Vertiv has not yet reported fourth quarter results. It has beat the last 3 quarters.\n\nVertiv trades with a forward P/E of 26.6. That is among the cheaper P/Es of the 5 stocks in this podcast.\n\nWill there be more upside in Vertiv after the earnings report?\n\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Buying on the All-Time High?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT in Zacks Value Investor portfolio and in her own personal portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Decoding Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) showcases robust systemwide sales with a strategic focus on high-quality food sourcing and rapid service. Despite strong market presence, CMG faces challenges in food safety and competitive fast-casual dining space. Opportunities for expansion and technology integration present potential growth avenues for CMG. External threats such as food safety concerns and market volatility remain significant factors for CMG's strategic planning.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with CMG.\n\nOn February 8, 2024, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) released its annual 10-K filing, providing a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health and strategic positioning. As the largest fast-casual chain restaurant in the United States, CMG reported systemwide sales of $8.6 billion in 2022, reflecting its dominance in the industry. With a footprint of nearly 3,200 stores, predominantly company-owned, CMG continues to focus on high-quality food sourcing, competitive pricing, and convenience to maintain its market lead. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by CMG's latest SEC filing, offering investors a nuanced understanding of the company's prospects and challenges. Decoding Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nBrand Power and Market Position: Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) stands out with its strong brand recognition and a loyal customer base. The company's commitment to \"Food with Integrity\" resonates with consumers, driving consistent traffic to its restaurants. CMG's systemwide sales of $8.6 billion in 2022 underscore its market dominance, particularly in the fast-casual dining segment. The brand's focus on high-quality ingredients and sustainable practices further strengthens its position, appealing to a growing demographic of health-conscious and environmentally aware customers.\n\nOperational Efficiency and Innovation: CMG's operational strategies are a testament to its strength. The company's emphasis on running successful restaurants is evident in its efficient service model and digital engagement. With 37.4% of its 2023 total revenue derived from digital orders, CMG has effectively harnessed technology to enhance customer convenience and drive growth. The introduction of Chipotlanes for mobile order pickups and partnerships with third-party delivery services have expanded CMG's reach, catering to the evolving preferences of its customer base.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nFood Safety Concerns: Despite rigorous quality assurance and food safety protocols, CMG has faced challenges with food-borne illnesses in the past, which have impacted its reputation. The 10-K filing acknowledges that food safety risks cannot be completely eliminated, and any incidents can adversely affect the brand's image and sales. The reliance on fresh produce and traditional cooking methods, while a strength in terms of food quality, also increases the risk of food safety incidents compared to competitors who may use more processed ingredients.\n\nSupply Chain Vulnerabilities: CMG's supply chain is subject to volatility due to factors such as weather, trade tariffs, and global events. The company's commitment to responsibly sourced ingredients, while commendable, also means that it operates within a smaller, more concentrated market, which can lead to supply shortages and increased costs. These vulnerabilities necessitate a robust risk management strategy to ensure consistent supply and cost control.\n\nOpportunities\n\nInternational Expansion: CMG's development agreement with Alshaya Group to open restaurants in the Middle East represents a significant opportunity for international growth. The expansion into new markets offers CMG the chance to tap into new customer segments and diversify its revenue streams. With careful execution and adherence to its core values, CMG can replicate its domestic success on a global scale.\n\nTechnological Advancements: The company's strategic focus on amplifying technology and innovation presents opportunities for further growth and productivity. CMG's investment in digital platforms and data analytics can enhance customer engagement, streamline operations, and create a more personalized dining experience. As technology continues to shape consumer behavior, CMG's proactive approach positions it well to capitalize on these trends.\n\nThreats\n\nCompetitive Market Dynamics: The fast-casual dining industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. CMG faces competition from both established chains and emerging concepts that emphasize high-quality ingredients and convenience. The rise of food delivery services also adds to the competitive landscape, as they offer customers a wider array of dining options. CMG must continue to innovate and differentiate itself to maintain its competitive edge.\n\nRegulatory and Economic Uncertainties: CMG operates in an environment where regulatory changes and economic uncertainties can pose threats to its business model. Changes in labor laws, minimum wage increases, and food safety regulations can impact operating costs and profitability. Additionally, economic downturns or shifts in consumer spending patterns can adversely affect restaurant traffic and sales. CMG must remain agile and responsive to these external factors to sustain its growth trajectory.\n\nIn conclusion, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) exhibits a robust financial performance with significant strengths in brand equity and operational efficiency. However, it must navigate weaknesses such as food safety concerns and supply chain vulnerabilities. Opportunities for international expansion and technological advancements offer promising avenues for growth, while competitive pressures and regulatory uncertainties present ongoing threats. CMG's strategic focus on quality, innovation, and expansion positions it well to address these challenges and capitalize on its market opportunities.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Why Is Chipotle (CMG) Stock Rocketing Higher Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of mexican fast-food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) jumped 8.4% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, same-store sales, and EPS exceeding analysts' estimates. The company's outperformance was driven by strong year-on-year unit growth of 7.4%. It also got a pricing tailwind of 1.0% and opened more restaurants in the quarter than expected (121 vs estimates of 117). A highlight of Chipotle's 2023 was that it formed its first international partnership with franchisee Alshaya Group in the Middle East. Should the company lean into franchising more going forward, financial performance could improve since the franchise model generally yields higher-margin royalty revenue and requires less capital investments. Looking ahead, Chipotle expects same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits for 2024, along with 300 new store openings. Overall, this was a fantastic quarter that should have shareholders cheering.\n\nIs now the time to buy Chipotle? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nChipotle's shares are not very volatile than the market average and over the last year have had only 2 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nChipotle is up 20.2% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Chipotle's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,604.\n\nDo you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

        "content": "Chipotle (CMG) easily beat fourth-quarter estimates as comparable sales jumped 8.4% year-over-year, with total revenue increasing 15.4% to $2.5 billion year-over-year. One thing on the horizon for Chipotle, and many large restaurant chains, is California's impending minimum wage hike to $20 per hour.\n\nChipotle CFO Jack Hartung joins the Live show alongside Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss Chipotle's earnings, what California's minimum wage hike for fast-food workers will mean for the company, and the fast-food industry at large, going forward .\n\nHartung comments on the impact the wage hike will have: \"Here's the thing that's unfortunate. This act was aimed towards, large restaurant chains, and large restaurant chains, like Chipotle, can afford to do this. We have scale. We can find efficiencies. We have menu pricing power. It doesn't technically apply to individual business owners. It doesn't apply to businesses outside the restaurants, but they're all going to be affected... The restaurant industry in California is the largest employer, in the state. So when that many people are going to get a significant raise, it is going to have a ripple effect. It is going to make things more expensive, I do think its going to have an inflationary impact and make it a little tougher to go to the grocery store or stay at a hotel, and of course, eat at a restaurant whether it's independent restaurant or a chain restaurant.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nCindy Olsen: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2024 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations Web site at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projections in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements.\n\nOur discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire Executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrian Niccol: Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered outstanding results this year, driven by our focus on exceptional people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput. This is driving a much better experience for our teams and our guests and resulted in accelerating transaction growth throughout 2023. For the year, sales grew 14% to reach $9.9 billion driven by a 7.9% comp. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 26.2%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $44.86 representing 37% growth over last year and we opened a record 271 new restaurants including 238 Chipotlanes. We also ended the year with a lot of momentum as demonstrated by our fourth quarter results.\n\nOur restaurant teams are making terrific progress in building a strong foundation around throughput and the return of Carne Asada as a limited time offer outperformed our expectations. For the quarter, sales grew 15% to $2.5 billion driven by 8.4% comp. Digital sales represented 36% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 25.4%, an increase of 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $10.36, representing 25% growth over last year. And we opened a record 121 new restaurants, including 110 Chipotlanes. As a reminder, we are returning to our pre-pandemic practice of only providing annual comp guidance. While January was impacted by weather throughout much of the country, as weather has normalized, our sales trends have strengthened.\n\nFor the full year, we anticipate comps in the mid-single digit range, as we continue to focus on the same five key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future. Now let me provide an update on each of these strategies, which include, number one, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level. Number two, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Number three, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement. Number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity of our restaurants, support centers, and in our supply chain.\n\nAnd number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. Starting with our world class people, I'm excited to share that Ilene Eskenazi joined my executive leadership team in November as our Chief Human Resources Officer, with over 25 years of experience in leading human resources and legal functions across a wide range of industries. I am confident Ilene will be instrumental in helping Chipotle develop and retain talent at every level of the organization and enhance the support we provide to our people, both in our restaurants and at our support centers. Strengthening Chipotle as a best-in-class employer. As I've said in the past, we want to attract and retain the best people that we can develop and grow.\n\nPart of this includes listening to their needs and investing in ways that will help our employees thrive both professionally and personally. This is why we recently added new benefits to our industry-leading benefits platform, like enhanced mental health care, a student loan retirement match, and additional financial wellness tools for our workforce. In addition to our benefits, our long-term growth opportunity and promote from within culture provides a path for team members to advance quickly within Chipotle. In fact, in 2023, we promoted over 24, 000 people, and over 90% of all restaurant management roles were internal promotions. This includes 87% of field leader positions, which is one of the biggest jumps for our teams, going from running one restaurant to an average of eight restaurants.\n\nThe ability to achieve this rate of internal promotions is a result of our strong restaurant leaders, many of whom started as crew members and who are committed to training and developing our future leaders. A great example is one of our field leaders in New York who has been with Chipotle for over 16 years. He helped to develop and promote over 40 team members who have grown within Chipotle and have gone on to become some of our best general managers, field leaders, team directors, and even one of our regional vice presidents. This is the type of person who will help us to deliver on our goals of running great restaurants, delivering industry leading economics, and expanding to 7, 000 restaurants in North America longer term. Great people executing great culinary and throughput results in a terrific guest experience and drives performance.\n\nAnd this brings me to our operations. Strong leadership is the key to running successful restaurants with fast throughput. So it is no surprise that the restaurants with the most tenured general managers are executing the best. The good news is our GM turnover is at some of the lowest levels that I have seen since I joined Chipotle. And over the last couple quarters, we have put the building blocks in place to deliver great throughput. As we mentioned last quarter, we have adjusted the cadence of orders on the digital make line to achieve a better balance of labor between the two lines. Additionally, we began collecting data on the execution of the four pillars of throughput in our restaurants and providing feedback and coaching on a weekly basis.\n\nThis is allowing our restaurant teams to see progress, which is energizing and motivating as the experience of winning catches momentum. And finally, our teams now have real time access to their Max 15 throughput results in the moment. So our GMs can coach and recognize great throughput while it is happening. Since we put these coaching tools in place in the third quarter, we have seen the number of restaurants with at least four crew members on the front line during peak periods improve from 30% to around 50%. This is driving an acceleration in our throughput performance as the number of entrees in our peak 15 minutes improved by a full point in the fourth quarter compared to last year. I am thrilled to see the progress we are beginning to make and continuing this momentum is critical as we approach our peak burrito season in mid-March.\n\nWe will also further strengthen our industry leading value proposition, which consists of delicious culinary, made with real ingredients, that is customizable, convenient, serve quickly, and an accessible price point. When we were executing on all parts of our value proposition, we were providing a great customer experience that would help all other drivers of sales perform better, such as menu and innovation. And last year, Chicken al Pastor and Carne Asada, both surpassed our expectations in drove incremental transactions. This is a testament to the cross-functional effort by our marketing, culinary, supply chain, and restaurant teams that do an outstanding job innovating, as well as bringing back past favorites that are more delicious each time and are executed seamlessly.\n\n2024 will be another exciting year for menu innovation, including one to two limited time offers and rolling out creative ways to shine a spotlight on our core menu throughout the year. As part of highlighting the core, we recently launched our latest lineup of lifestyle bowls, which shows how the customization of our real ingredients allows Chipotle to embrace all interpretations of wellness, whether it be plant-based, high protein, keto, paleo, and more. In connection with the launch, we announced a partnership with Strava, the leading digital community for active people with more than 120 million athletes, to encourage and reward healthy habits with a chance to earn free lifestyle goals. This is giving our fans the right tools to sustain healthy habits in 2024 and beyond.\n\nIn addition to menu innovation, our marketing team continues to do a fantastic job of making the Chipotle brand more visible, more relevant, and more loved to drive difference, culture, and drive a purchase. Our Behind the Foil campaign is a great example as it highlights key differentiators of Chipotle. This includes our restaurant teams preparing our real ingredients, made fresh every day using classic culinary techniques, such as dicing onions and jalapenos, hand-mashing our signature guac, and grilling our adobo chicken, steak, and fajita veggies on the Plancha. We will continue to evolve the Behind the Foil campaign in 2024, and it's really exciting to see that our best performing ads are an authentic, behind the scenes look into a day in the life of a Chipotle team member. A chef plating up a wide variety of dishes for a restaurant chain.\n\nThis certainly demonstrates one of our core values, which is authenticity was here. Our food is real, and so are we. Shifting to amplifying technology innovation, we have made a lot of progress this year on improving the digital experience. We made several enhancements to our app functionality, including order readiness messaging, wrong location detection, reminders to scan for points to check out, prior order history and more. This has helped to reduce friction points and improve the overall experience for guests. We also launched Freepotle for our rewards members, which was successful in driving engagement and enrolling new members as we were able to surprise and delight our guests with free rewards such as guac, a beverage, or double meat.\n\nFrom the Freepotle drops, we were able to learn more about our rewards members to improve our ability to deliver relevant experiences in the future. Finally, we recently rolled out suggestive upsell on our app at checkout, based on data we have on our rewards members including prior order history. Going forward, I believe we are on a multiyear path to commercializing our customer data and insights into more targeted marketing campaigns and improving the overall digital experience that will drive increased frequency and spend over time. I also wanted to spend a few minutes providing an update on our Cultivate Next Fund which launched two years ago with an objective of making early-stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further our mission to cultivate a better world and accelerate our strategic priorities.\n\nSince launching this fund, the amount of innovation that we have seen across the food tech landscape has surpassed our expectations and encompasses everything from farming to supply chain to alternative proteins and oils to in-restaurant automation and more. We have reviewed hundreds of innovative companies and have made seven investments of which there are many opportunities for commercial engagements. This includes Hyphen, which we are partnering with to develop our automated digital make line and Vebu which we are partnering with to develop Autocado that cuts cores and scoops avocados. Both Hyphen and Autocado could help to improve the overall experience for our teams by removing less favorable tasks and for our guests by providing on time accurate and delicious food.\n\nWe continue to work on iterations of each technology at our Cultivate Center. And the good news is that we plan to pilot the automated digital make line and Autocado in a restaurant in 2024 as part of our stage gate process. Last month, we announced two more investments in Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity. Greenfield Robotics provides regenerative agriculture solutions without chemicals using fleets of autonomous robots to weed fields. And Nitricity uses technology to tackle greenhouse gas emissions by creating natural fertilizer products that are better for fields, farmers, and the environment. We believe both Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity could play an important role in ensuring a more sustainable future for farms within our supply chain.\n\nOur suppliers are a key enabler of Chipotle's growth and help us to further our purpose of cultivating a better world. We will continue to find innovative ways to support their ability to grow, harvest, and supply the high quality, sustainably raised real ingredients that Chipotle serves. Our final strategic pillar is expanding access and our development team has done an incredible job of meeting our development targets despite the timeline challenges we continue to see. In the fourth quarter, we opened 121 new restaurants and for the full year, we opened 271 new restaurants, which is the highest number of openings in the company's history in a single quarter and in a single year. We have now surpassed 800 Chipotlanes and continue to see very strong results with Chipotlanes driving higher new restaurant productivity, margins, and returns.\n\nAdditionally, this year, we had some fantastic openings in new markets with our first restaurant in Calgary breaking an opening day record and sustaining very high volumes post opening day. When we serve delicious food with exceptional operations and execute great local marketing, our brand gains traction quickly, and Canada is a testament to this. We will continue to accelerate our growth in Canada in 2024, with 10 to 14 new restaurant openings planned, representing 25% to 35% growth for the country, and in total we continue to target 285 to 315 new restaurant openings in 2024, mostly in North America, with over 80% including at Chipotlane. So, to conclude, I want to thank our 115, 000 employees for their hard work which drove strong results in 2023.\n\nWe hit some big milestones, including surpassing 3, 400 restaurants, 800 Chipotlanes, $3 million in AUVs, and forming our first international partnership. As I look forward, I see the opportunity longer term to more than double our restaurants in North America, increase our penetration of Chipotlanes, surpass $4 million in AUVs, expand our industry leading margins and returns and further our purpose of cultivating a better world globally. As I mentioned in the beginning, this ambitious plan will require exceptional people, exceptional food, and exceptional throughput. The good news is that I am certainly at the right people and the right strategy to achieve it. So with that, I will turn it over to Jack.\n\nJack Hartung: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the fourth quarter grew 15% year-over-year to reach $2.5 billion as comp sales grew 8.4% driven by over 7% transaction growth. Restaurant level margin of 25.4% increased about 140 basis points compared to last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $10.36 representing 25% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to elevated depreciation and changes to illegal contingency. Looking at fiscal 2024, we anticipate comps in the mid-single digit range for the full year. As a reminder, we were impacted by unusually cold weather throughout the country in January. As the weather has normalized, our underlying sales trends remain strong and they support our full year guidance range.\n\nAdditionally, Q1 will include the benefit of an extra day due to leap year, but this will be offset by Easter shifting into Q1 this year compared to Q2 of last year. I'll now go through the key P&L line items beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.7%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year. A larger mixed shift to beef due to the success of Carne Asada as well as elevated cost across the board most notably beef produce and queso was partially offset by the benefit of menu price increases and lower paper costs. For Q1, we expect our cost of sales to be in the low 29% range as the benefit of the mixed shift out of Carne Asada will be partially offset by higher costs across several line items, most notably avocados and tortillas.\n\nWe anticipate cost of sales inflation to be in the low to mid-single digit range for the full year. Labor costs for the fourth quarter were 25%, a decrease of about 60 basis points. points from last year. The benefit of sales leverage and better labor execution more than offset wage inflation and higher performance-based compensation. For Q1, we expect our labor costs to be in the low 25% range with wage inflation and the low to mid-single digit range. And we anticipate wage inflation will tick up to the mid-single digit range as California wages go up around 20% in April this year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.7%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was driven by sales leverage as well as lower marketing and promo cost which were 3.1% of sales in Q4, a decrease of about 30 basis points from last year.\n\nIn Q1, we expect marketing costs to be in the low 3% range with full year to come in right around 3%. In Q1, other operating costs are expected to be in the high 14% range. G&A for the quarter was $169 million on a GAAP basis or $170 million on a non -GAAP basis, excluding about $1 million change in illegal contingency. G&A also include $122 million in underlying G&A, $36 million related to non-cash stock compensation, $10 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity investing and exercises, and $2 million related to our upcoming All Manager Conference, which is scheduled for Q1 of this year. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $127 million in Q1 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support our ongoing growth.\n\nWe anticipate stock comp will be around $32 million in Q1, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance and is subject to the final 2024 grants which are issued in Q1. We also expect to recognize around $7 million related to employer taxes associated with shares divest during the quarter and $21 million for costs associated with our bi annual All Manager Conference in March, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q1 to around $187 million. Adjusted depreciation for the quarter was $79 million or 3.1% of sales, and for 2024 we expect it to remain right around this level as a percent of sales. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 26.2% for both GAAP and non-GAAP and for 2024 we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items.\n\nOur balance sheet remains strong as we enter the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, restricting the cash and investments with no debt, and during the fourth quarter, we repurchased $144 million of our stock at an average price of $1, 936. For the full year, we repurchased a total of $590 million at an average price of $1, 827, and going forward we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. During the quarter, our Board authorized an additional $200 million for our share authorization program, and at the end of the quarter we had $424 million remaining. We opened a record 121 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, of which 110 had a Chipotlane, and as we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate opening between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024, with over 80% having a Chipotlane.\n\nWe continue to see developers delaying projects due to macro pressures and high interest rates, along with permitting, inspection, and utility installation delays. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes these challenges persist, and we remain on track to move towards the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming conditions do not worsen. In closing, Chipotle is a purpose-driven company that has been able to scale over the last 30 years into one of the largest restaurant brands in the world. An exciting part is that we still have a long growth runway in front of us. Our strong economic model gives us a high degree of confidence that our ambitious growth objectives are achievable, if not beatable. And as we continue to protect and strengthen our economic model, our long-term growth opportunity will only expand just as it has over the last 30 years.\n\nSo thank you to all of our employees for their hard work and their dedication to Chipotle, and let's keep the momentum going in 2024. With that, we'll open the lines for your questions.\n\nSee also 15 Highest Quality Tea Brands in 2024 and 11 Best Gold Stocks For Inflation.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "title": "Late-Session Earnings Bonanza: Ford, Chipotle, Snap &amp; More",
        "content": "Markets bounced back this Tuesday from a Monday sell-off, though not all the way back to Friday highs (on the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq; the Russell 2000 saw its near-term high in late January). The Dow gained +141 points, +0.37%, while the S&P gained +0.23%. The Nasdaq, while positive, was essentially flat at +0.07%, while the small-cap Russell won the day, +0.85%, and continues inching its way back toward breakeven.\r\n\r\nFord F is enjoying one of its best trading days in recent memory, shooting up +4% ahead of its Q4 earnings announcement, then an additional +6% on the release: earnings of 29 cents per share outperformed the 12 cents in the Zacks consensus (though still well off the 51 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter) on better-than-expected revenues of $43.2 billion \u2014 nicely ahead of the $38 billion analysts had been expecting. This is Ford\u2019s second-straight earnings beat.\r\n\r\nAcross individual units, EVs lost -$1.5 billion, roughly in-line with estimates, whereas the combination internal combustion engine (ICE) and hybrid unit gained $813 million in the quarter. Commercial vehicles performed even better: $1.81 billion over the past three months. The company also announced a special dividend of 18 cents per share, in addition to its normal quarterly dividend of 15 cents. Ford stock is now less than -1% year to date.\r\n\r\nChipotle CMG is also performing well in today\u2019s after-market, following it Q4 results after the closing bell today: earnings of $10.36 per share is a strong improvement from the projected $9.73 (and ahead of the $8.29 per share in the year-ago quarter), on quarterly sales of $2.52 billion, beating the $2.49 billion in the Zacks consensus. Same-store sales outperformed, +8.4% versus the +7.1% anticipated, as the company cited increased traffic and some price hikes for the outperformance. Chipotle also plans to open between 285-315 new stores in 2024. Shares are up +2.5% in late trading.\r\n\r\nSnap SNAP shares, however, sold off heavily immediately following its mixed Q4 report after today\u2019s close, with earnings of 8 cents per share beating consensus by a penny, while revenues of $1.36 billion was light the $1.39 billion expected. Daily active users (DAU), at 414 million, were slightly better than expected, though guidance looks weak. As a result, shares are getting pummeled -31% after hours, giving up most of the +43% gains the stock had made over the past year.\r\n\r\nNorth Face and Vans parent VFC VFC also came up light in its fiscal Q3 this afternoon, with earnings of 57 cents per share on quarterly sales of $2.96 billion missing estimates of 79 cents and $3.26 billion, respectively. Vans fell -28% in the quarter, while North Face was -10%. Wholesale came in -26% and direct-to-consumer was -8%. However, the company also announced a strategic review, which will hopefully right the ship. Even still, shares are -8.5% in the late session.\r\n\r\nGilead GILD, a drug company specializing in HIV treatment and Hep-C drugs, missed earnings estimates by 4 cents per share to $1.72 (above the $1.67 per share a year ago) while reporting sales of $7.12 billion in Q4, higher than the $7.08 billion in the Zacks consensus. Lower revenues of Covid treatment drugs were cited. That said, guidance for next quarter earnings are up, but still not enough to keep shares from sliding an additional -3% in after-hours trading.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Tops Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) came out with quarterly earnings of $10.36 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.73 per share. This compares to earnings of $8.29 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.47%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this Mexican food chain would post earnings of $10.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $11.36, delivering a surprise of 8.60%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nChipotle , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, posted revenues of $2.52 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.98%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.18 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nChipotle shares have added about 8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Chipotle?\n\nWhile Chipotle has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Chipotle: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $11.91 on $2.66 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $52.94 on $11.15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Restaurants is currently in the bottom 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nFirst Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. (FWRG), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2023.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +500%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nFirst Watch Restaurant Group, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $238.62 million, up 28.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Revenue: Increased by 14.3% to $9.9 billion for FY23. Net Income: Grew to $1.23 billion, or $44.34 per diluted share for FY23. Comparable Restaurant Sales: Rose by 7.9% for the full year. Restaurant Level Operating Margin: Improved to 26.2% for FY23. New Restaurant Openings: 271 new restaurants, including 238 with a Chipotlane. Digital Sales: Accounted for 37.4% of total food and beverage revenue. Stock Repurchase: $589.8 million of stock repurchased at an average price of $1,827.46 per share.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with CMG.\n\nOn February 6, 2024, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) released its 8-K filing, announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The company, known for its fast-casual Mexican cuisine, has shown a remarkable performance with significant growth in revenue, net income, and comparable restaurant sales.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is the largest fast-casual chain restaurant in the United States, with systemwide sales of $8.6 billion in 2022. The company operates nearly 3,200 stores, primarily in the United States, and focuses on high-quality food sourcing and convenience. Its revenue is generated entirely from restaurant sales and delivery fees.\n\nThe company's financial achievements, including a 38% increase in EPS and a 7.9% rise in comparable sales, underscore its successful strategy in a competitive industry. The expansion of restaurant-level operating margins to 26.2% for the full year, compared to 23.9% in 2022, highlights Chipotle's ability to leverage sales and manage costs effectively. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG) Reports Robust Earnings Growth and Margin Expansion for FY23\n\nFinancial Performance and Challenges\n\nChipotle's total revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, a 15.4% increase from the previous year, driven by an 8.4% increase in comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings. Digital sales, which represented 36.1% of total food and beverage revenue, continue to be a strong growth driver for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the positive growth, the company faced challenges such as inflationary pressures, particularly in beef and produce costs, which led to a 40 basis point increase in food, beverage, and packaging costs as a percentage of total revenue. However, the impact was partially offset by menu price increases and lower paper costs.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $169.2 million on a GAAP basis, and $170.0 million on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting investments in the company's growth initiatives and stock compensation.\n\nKey Financial Metrics\n\nImportant metrics from the income statement include a net income for the fourth quarter of $282.1 million, or $10.21 per diluted share, compared to $223.7 million, or $8.02 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. The balance sheet shows a solid position with $560.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe cash flow statement reveals that net cash provided by operating activities for the year was $1.78 billion. The company's disciplined capital allocation is evident in its strategic stock repurchase program, with $589.8 million of stock repurchased at an average price per share of $1,827.46 during 2023.\n\nOutlook and Analysis\n\nLooking ahead, Chipotle's management anticipates continued growth, with plans to open more restaurants, including those with Chipotlanes, which enhance guest access and convenience. The company's strong financial performance, including its impressive EPS growth and expanded margins, positions it well to achieve its long-term growth goals.\n\nChipotle's commitment to innovation, digital expansion, and operational efficiency, along with its focus on providing high-quality food, should help sustain its momentum in the fast-casual dining sector. The company's robust financial health and strategic initiatives are likely to continue attracting value investors interested in the restaurant industry.\n\nFor more detailed information, investors are encouraged to review the full earnings release and financial statements available in the 8-K filing.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) Q4: Beats On Revenue\n\nMexican fast-food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) reported results ahead of analysts' expectations in Q4 FY2023, with revenue up 15.4% year on year to $2.52 billion. It made a non-GAAP profit of $10.36 per share, improving from its profit of $8.29 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Chipotle? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $2.52 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.49 billion (1.1% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $10.36 vs analyst estimates of $9.73 (6.5% beat) Free Cash Flow of $93.53 million, down 73.2% from the previous quarter Gross Margin (GAAP): 40.1%, up from 39.6% in the same quarter last year Same-Store Sales were up 8.4% year on year Store Locations: 3,437 at quarter end, increasing by 250 over the last 12 months Market Capitalization: $67.81 billion\n\n\"2023 was an outstanding year where we delivered strong transaction growth driven by throughput and menu innovation, opened a record number of new restaurants, surpassed $3 million in AUVs and formed our first international partnership,\" said Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, Chipotle.\n\nBorn from a desire to offer quick meals with fresh, flavorful ingredients, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a fast-food chain known for its healthy, Mexican-inspired cuisine and customizable dishes.\n\nModern Fast Food\n\nModern fast food is a relatively newer category representing a middle ground between traditional fast food and sit-down restaurants. These establishments feature an expanded menu selection priced above traditional fast food options, often incorporating fresher and cleaner ingredients to serve customers prioritizing quality. These eateries are capitalizing on the perception that your drive-through burger and fries joint is detrimental to your health because of inferior ingredients.\n\nSales Growth\n\nChipotle is one of the most widely recognized restaurant chains in the world and benefits from brand equity, giving it customer loyalty and more influence over purchasing decisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 15.3% over the last four years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts) was impressive as it added more dining locations and increased sales at existing, established restaurants. Chipotle Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Chipotle reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 15.4%, and its $2.52 billion in revenue exceeded Wall Street's estimates by 1.1%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 13% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nNumber of Stores\n\nA restaurant chain's total number of dining locations is a crucial factor influencing how much it can sell and how quickly company-level sales can grow.\n\nWhen a chain like Chipotle is opening new restaurants, it usually means it's investing for growth because there's healthy demand for its meals and there are markets where the concept has few or no locations. Since last year, Chipotle's restaurant count increased by 250, or 7.8%, to 3,437 locations in the most recently reported quarter. Chipotle Operating Retail Locations\n\nTaking a step back, Chipotle has rapidly opened new restaurants over the last eight quarters, averaging 7.3% annual increases in new locations. This growth is much higher than other restaurant businesses. Analyzing a restaurant's location growth is important because expansion means Chipotle has more opportunities to feed customers and generate sales.\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nSame-store sales growth is an important metric that tracks organic growth and demand for a restaurant's established locations.\n\nChipotle's demand within its existing restaurants has generally risen over the last two years but lagged behind the broader sector. On average, the company's same-store sales have grown by 8% year on year. With positive same-store sales growth amid an increasing number of restaurants, Chipotle is reaching more diners and growing sales. Chipotle Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nIn the latest quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 8.4% year on year. This growth was an acceleration from the 5.6% year-on-year increase it posted 12 months ago, which is always an encouraging sign.\n\nKey Takeaways from Chipotle's Q4 Results\n\nWe enjoyed seeing Chipotle beat analysts' revenue, same-store sales, and EPS estimates this quarter. The company's outperformance was driven by strong year-on-year unit growth of 7.4%. It also got a pricing tailwind of 1.0% and opened more restaurants in the quarter than expected (121 vs estimates of 117). A highlight of Chipotle's 2023 was that it formed its first international partnership with franchisee Alshaya Group in the Middle East. Looking ahead, Chipotle expects same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits for 2024 along with 300 new store openings. We think this was a fantastic quarter that should have shareholders cheering. The stock is up 2.1% after reporting and currently trades at $2,546 per share.\n\nChipotle may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nOne way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excluded a $0.15 after-tax impact from expenses related to accelerated depreciation, partially offset by a reduction in contingencies related to certain legal proceedings,\u00a0was $10.361, a 25.0% increase from $8.29.1 Opened 121 new restaurants with 110 locations including a\u00a0Chipotlane\n\nFull year 2023 highlights, year over year:\n\nTotal revenue increased 14.3% to $9.9 billion Comparable restaurant sales increased 7.9% Operating margin was 15.8%, an increase from 13.4% Restaurant level operating margin was 26.2%1, an increase of 230 basis points Diluted earnings per share was $44.34, a 38.4% increase from $32.04. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excluded a $0.52 after-tax impact from expenses related to restaurant and corporate level impairment and closure costs, accelerated depreciation and corporate restructuring, partially offset by a reduction in contingencies related to certain legal proceedings, was $44.861, a 36.9% increase from $32.78.1 Opened 271 new restaurants with 238 locations including a Chipotlane\n\n\"2023 was an outstanding year where we delivered strong transaction growth driven by throughput and menu innovation, opened a record number of new restaurants, surpassed $3 million in AUVs and formed our first international partnership,\" said\u00a0Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, Chipotle. \"I am more confident than ever that we have the right people and the right strategy to achieve our long-term growth goals of reaching 7,000 restaurants in North America, $4 million in AUVs, expanding our industry leading margins and returns and furthering our purpose of Cultivating a Better World globally.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nResults for the three months ended December 31, 2023:\n\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of 15.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in total revenue was driven by an 8.4% increase in comparable restaurant sales attributable to higher transactions of 7.4% and an increase in average check of 1.0%, and to a lesser extent, new restaurant openings. Digital sales represented 36.1% of total food and beverage revenue.\n\nWe opened 121 new restaurants during the fourth quarter with 110 locations including a Chipotlane. These formats continue to perform well and are helping enhance guest access and convenience, as well as increase new restaurant sales, margins, and returns.\n\nFood, beverage and packaging costs in the fourth quarter were 29.7% of total revenue, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Food costs increased due to a higher mix of beef as well as inflation across the menu, most notably higher costs for beef, produce, and queso. These increases were partially offset by the benefit of menu price increases and, to a lesser extent, lower paper costs.\n\nRestaurant level operating margin in the fourth quarter was 25.4% compared to 24.0% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement was primarily due to the benefit of sales leverage and, to a lesser extent, lower paper costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher inflation across several food costs and, to a lesser extent, wage inflation.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were\u00a0$169.2 million\u00a0on a GAAP basis, or\u00a0$170.0 million1 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding a $0.8 million reduction in contingencies related to certain legal proceedings. GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter also include $122.0 million of underlying general and administrative expenses, $35.7 million of non-cash stock compensation, $10.1 million of higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises and $2.2 million of other costs, primarily related to our upcoming All Managers Conference scheduled for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.2% compared to 26.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The slight decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from option exercises and equity vesting, partially offset by an increase in tax reserves and nondeductible expenses.\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter was $282.1 million, or $10.21 per diluted share, compared to $223.7 million, or $8.02 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding a $0.15 after-tax impact from expenses related to accelerated depreciation, partially offset by a reduction in contingencies related to certain legal proceedings, adjusted net income was $286.2 million1 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.361.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved the investment of up to an additional $200 million, exclusive of commissions, to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. Including this repurchase authorization, $424.1 million was available as of December 31, 2023. The repurchase authorization may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. We repurchased $144.3 million of stock at an average price per share of $1,935.80 during the fourth quarter.\n\nResults for the full year ended December 31, 2023:\n\nTotal revenue for 2023 was $9.9 billion, an increase of 14.3% compared to 2022. The increase in total revenue was driven by a 7.9% increase in comparable restaurant sales attributable to higher transactions of 5.0% and an increase in average check of 2.9% and, to a lesser extent, new restaurant openings. Digital sales represented 37.4% of total food and beverage revenue.\n\nWe opened 271 new restaurants during 2023, bringing the total restaurant count at year-end to 3,437. Of the 271 new restaurants opened during the year, 238 locations included a Chipotlane. We had a total of 811 Chipotlanes as of year-end, which includes conversions of existing restaurants.\n\nFood, beverage and packaging costs for 2023 were 29.5% of total revenue, a decrease of 60 basis points compared to 2022. Food costs benefited from menu price increases and, to a lesser extent, lower avocado costs. These benefits were partially offset by inflation across several ingredient costs, most notably beef, tortillas, and queso.\n\nRestaurant level operating margin for 2023 was 26.2% compared to 23.9% in 2022. The improvement was primarily due to the benefit of sales leverage and, to a lesser extent, lower avocado prices. These decreases were partially offset by higher inflation across several food costs and, to a lesser extent, wage inflation.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2023 were\u00a0$633.6 million\u00a0on a GAAP basis, or\u00a0$629.6 million1 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $4.8 million of corporate restructuring costs and a $0.8 million reduction in contingencies related to certain legal proceedings. GAAP and non-GAAP General and administrative expenses for full year 2023 also include $478.9 million of underlying general and administrative expenses, $118.5 million of non-cash stock compensation, $25.3 million of higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises and $6.9 million of other costs, primarily related to our upcoming All Managers Conference scheduled for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe effective income tax rate for 2023 was 24.2% compared to 23.9% in 2022. The increase in the tax rate was primarily due to fewer tax benefits related to option exercises and equity vesting.\n\nNet income for 2023 was $1.23 billion, or $44.34 per diluted share, compared to net income of $899.1 million, or $32.04 per diluted share for 2022. Excluding a $0.52 after-tax impact from expenses related to restaurant and corporate level impairment and closure costs, accelerated depreciation, corporate restructuring, partially offset by a reduction in contingencies related to certain legal proceedings, adjusted net income for 2023 was $1.24 billion1 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $44.861.\n\nDuring 2023 we repurchased a total of $589.8 million of stock at an average price per share of $1,827.46.\n\nMore information will be available in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which will be filed with the SEC in early February 2024.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, management is anticipating the following:\n\nFull year comparable restaurant sales growth in the mid-single digit range 285 to 315 new restaurant openings, which assumes developer, permit, inspection, and utility delays do not worsen An estimated underlying effective full year tax rate between 25% and 27% before discrete items\n\nDefinitions\n\nThe\u00a0following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this release:\n\nComparable restaurant sales, or sales comps, and comparable restaurant transactions, represent the change in period-over-period total revenue or transactions for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months. Average restaurant sales refer to the average trailing 12-month food and beverage revenue for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Restaurant level operating margin represents total revenue less direct restaurant operating costs, expressed as a percent of total revenue. Digital sales represent food and beverage revenue generated through the Chipotle website, Chipotle app or third-party delivery aggregators. Digital sales include revenue deferrals associated with Chipotle Rewards.\n\nConference Call Details\n\nChipotle\u00a0will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 6, 2024, at 4:30 PM Eastern time to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results, as well as provide a business update for the 2024 first quarter.\n\nThe\u00a0conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 1-888-317-6003, or for international callers by dialing 1-412-317-6061, and use code: 2191312.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented in the text above to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAdjusted net income is net income excluding expenses related to restaurant and corporate asset impairment, corporate restructuring, certain legal proceedings, stock-based compensation modification expense, unrealized gains on equity investments, separation costs, accelerated depreciation and certain other costs. Adjusted general and administrative expense is general and administrative expense excluding corporate restructuring expenses, certain legal proceedings, stock-based compensation modification expense, separation costs, and certain other costs. Adjusted depreciation and amortization is depreciation and amortization expense excluding certain accelerated depreciation expense. The adjusted effective income tax rate is the effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the after tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments. Restaurant Level Operating Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is equal to the revenues generated by our restaurants less their direct operating costs which consist of food, beverage and packaging, labor, occupancy and other operating costs. This performance measure primarily includes the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other costs that are essential to conduct our business. Management uses restaurant level operating margin as a measure of restaurant performance. Management believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP measures in order to facilitate meaningful evaluation of our operating performance across periods. These adjustments are intended to provide greater transparency of underlying performance and to allow investors to evaluate our business on the same basis as our management, which uses these non-GAAP measures in evaluating the company's performance.

        "content": "Following a week highlighted by big tech, this week\u2019s earnings lineup features several top-rated stocks from a variety of sectors.\n\nSet to release their quarterly results on Tuesday, February 6, here are several standout stocks that investors will certainly want to pay attention to.\n\nAllianceBernstein AB\n\nFinancial investment management firm AllianceBernstein is attractive ahead of its Q4 report and covets a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. Interestingly enough, AllianceBernstein\u2019s Zacks Financial-Investment Management Industry is currently in the top 16% of over 250 Zacks industries.\n\nAllianceBernstein\u2019s Q4 earnings are expected to dip -8% to $0.64 a share but the Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) indicates the company could top expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.66 a share. On the top line, Q4 sales are projected to be up 8% to $869.4 million. Most perplexing is that AllianceBernstein\u2019s stock currently trades at a very reasonable 11.1X forward earnings multiple which makes its 7.78% annual dividend yield more alluring as well. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify SPOT\n\nMusic streaming services leader Spotify will be drawing a lot of attention on Tuesday and also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Spotify belongs to the Zacks Business Services sector with its Zacks Technology Services Industry in the top 33% of all Zacks industries.\n\nGravitating towards what may eventually be lucrative profitability, Spotify is expected to post a much narrower adjusted loss of -$0.08 a share compared to -$1.43 a share in Q4 2022. Plus, quarterly sales are forecasted to jump 22% to $3.96 billion which would continue to foreshadow Spotify\u2019s future earnings potential. This optimism has led to Spotify being one of the market's top performers with SPOT shares up +83% over the last year to largely outperform the broader indexes and the Zacks Technology Services Market\u2019s +27%.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Stocks to Watch\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill CMG, Centene CNC, and Ford F are three other top-rated stocks to watch in Tuesday\u2019s earnings lineup.\n\nThese stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ahead of their quarterly results with Chipotle continuing to stand out in terms of its robust growth among the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector while Ford and Centene are two intriguing value stocks to consider in the Zacks Auto sector and the Zacks Medical sector respectively.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "What To Watch: Chipotle Earnings",
        "content": "Let's talk operating margins and avocados? Chipotle's (CMG) quarterly results seem to give a pulse on Americans willingness to spend. Here's why and here's what you need to know ahead of fourth quarter earnings results.\n\n1. Foot Traffic:\n\nA business that prides itself on pricing power has proven it's not just big talk. Last time out, it reported quarterly same store sales growth of 5%. Despite a tricky consumer landscape, last quarter's numbers told the story of a strong customer base willing to splurge a little extra even in the era of elevated inflation. Let's see if restaurant sales growth lands in mid to high single digit range for Q4 and the full year as guided by the business. Now, CEO Brian Nicholas called the value proposition of the company \"stronger than ever\" and the proof, it's in the burrito bowl.\n\n2. Pricing:\n\nThink of Chipotle as the other great American institution that was pausing hikes last year. The burrito maker held off on raising prices for over a year, and then in October, it bit the bullet amid still elevated inflation. That strong report was boosted by the feed through of earlier price hikes, which offset increases in some key ingredients like beef and queso. Even though inflation is heading back down to target, keep an eye out on all those important input costs.\n\n3. Expansion & Innovation:\n\nIf history is any guide, price hikes can be absorbed easily. But you need to keep things fresh to keep people coming back. That's why the likes of the carne asada and chicken al pastor gave customers some variety they shouted out last year. We'll keep an eye out for any limited time offerings in the near future. What about those new restaurants? Could there be as many as 300 new locations in the coming year? Look out for updates on plans to open 7,000 restaurants in North America. As far as the analyst community: Citi analyst John Tower told Yahoo! Finance the company is likely going to continue to see share gains. Shares have been on a good run as of late, but keep your eye out on those avocado costs. About half of Chipotle's transactions includes guacamole. Price increases there might not be so great for shareholders. As always, Yahoo! Finance is across the report with everything you need to know.",

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Chipotle (CMG)",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this Mexican food chain a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Chipotle is 40.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 19.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 17.1%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Chipotle is 23.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 3.6%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 28% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 3.6%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Chipotle have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.8% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Chipotle a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Chipotle is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar",
        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill.

        "content": "Chipotle Earnings: What To Look For From CMG\n\nMexican fast-food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow afternoon. Here's what to look for.\n\nLast quarter Chipotle reported revenues of $2.47 billion, up 11.3% year on year, missing analyst expectations by 0.1%. It was a dcent quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nIs Chipotle buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Chipotle's revenue to grow 14.1% year on year to $2.49 billion, improving on the 11.2% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $9.73 per share. Chipotle Total Revenue\n\nThe analysts covering the company have been growing increasingly bullish about the business heading into the earnings, with revenue estimates seeing eight upward revisions over the last thirty days. The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates five times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Chipotle's peers in the restaurants segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. Brinker International delivered top-line growth of 5.4% year on year, missing analyst estimates by 0.4% and Kura Sushi reported revenues up 30.9% year on year, exceeding estimates by 0.1%. Brinker International traded flat on the results, and Kura Sushi was down 4.6%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Brinker International's results here and Kura Sushi's results here.\n\nInvestors in the restaurants segment have had steady hands going into the earnings, with the stocks up on average 1.7% over the last month. Chipotle is up 11.3% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $2,444.4, compared to share price of $2,489.\n\nOne way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry  and with revenue growth of 70% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.\n\nStory continues\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "content": "Fast-food prices in California are set to rise this spring with businesses responding to the state\u2019s $20 per hour minimum wage law for fast-food workers that will take effect on April 1, 2024.\n\nThe law was signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom last fall and will require a $20 per hour minimum wage at all restaurants with at least 60 locations nationwide \u2013 though the law includes an exception for restaurants that make and sell their own bread.\n\nSeveral major fast-food franchises, including McDonald\u2019s and Chipotle, have already signaled that prices will have to rise in response to the increased labor costs.\n\n\"Everyone is going to have to pay more,\" Jack Hartung, chief financial officer of Chipotle, said in the Wall Street Journal. The California-based company expects to raise prices by about 5% to 9% more at its restaurants in the Golden State to cover the costs.\n\nCALIFORNIA CRIME WAVE TAKES ITS TOLL ON IN-N-OUT, OTHER COMPANIES AS BUSINESSES START TO ISSUE SAFETY WARNINGS Chipotle has said that a price hike of 5% to 9% was likely due to the California minimum wage law.\n\nHartung told the Journal in November that he expects Chipotle\u2019s labor costs to rise in the 15% to 20% range, which he said is \"significant enough that it puts a dent in our economics.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nHe added at the time that although he didn\u2019t see it having an immediate impact on restaurant opening plans, customers\u2019 response to price hikes will factor into those decisions. Chipotle is expected to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday.\n\nLOS ANGELES DESSERT SHOP ANNOUNCES SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LOCATIONS, CITES COST OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA\n\nMcDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said on an earnings call in October that prices at the fast-food giant will have to rise even though the company hadn\u2019t determined at the time how large the increases would be.\n\n\"Certainly, there\u2019s going to be some element of that that does need to be worked through with higher pricing,\" Kempczinski said. \"There\u2019s also going to be things that I know the franchisees and our teams there are going to be looking at around productivity. How all of that plays out, there will certainly be a hit in the short term to franchisee cash flow in California; tough to know exactly what that hit will be because of some of the mitigation efforts.\"\n\nStory continues McDonald's is among the fast-food chains anticipating the need to raise prices in California due to the increased minimum wage.\n\nMcDonald's is scheduled to report earnings before the opening bell on Monday.\n\nJack in the Box said during an earnings call in November that it expects to raise prices by 6% to 8% across the company primarily to address increased wage expenses stemming from the California law. The company will likely provide an update when it releases earnings later this month.\n\nCALIFORNIA JOB GROWTH FALLS BY MOST IN THE NATION POST-PANDEMIC: REPORT Burger King is adding more kiosks to help restaurants more efficient for workers and customers.\n\nSome restaurants may turn to increased automation as a way of mitigating the impact of a higher minimum wage in the industry.\n\nJosh Kobza, the CEO of Burger King's parent company Restaurant Brands International, told investors during an earnings call in November that the chain plans to speed up its rollout of digital ordering kiosks, which let restaurant workers focus more on preparing food and can improve order accuracy, reducing stressful interactions between employees and customers.\n\n\"My point of view is we need to get this business to 100% digital,\" Kobza said. \"We should have all of the order-taking done through digital ordering channels over time.\"\n\nCalifornia\u2019s minimum wage ticked up to $16 an hour in January for all jobs in the state \u2013 up from $15.50 an hour which was already the highest in the nation.\n\nOriginal article source:Fast-food prices set to rise at McDonald's, Chipotle and others as California minimum wage hike looms",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nStocks are back near record highs with the S&P 500 finishing Friday at 4,959, its highest close ever. All three major indexes logged gains for the week, surviving a tumultuous week of trading.\n\nStocks initially slid following lackluster tech results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and sold off further on Wednesday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut in March is not the \"base case.\"\n\nBut blowout earnings from Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN), combined with a stronger-than-expected January jobs report, sent stocks into rally mode. morning brief image\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained just under 1%.\n\nA slew of corporate earnings including reports from Eli Lily (LLY), Disney (DIS), Spotify (SPOT), McDonald's (MCD), Chipotle (CMG), and Pepsi (PEP) will greet investors in the week ahead amid a light economic schedule.\n\nThe rate cut debate rolls on\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell poured cold water on investor hopes for a March interest rate cut during his press conference following the January Fed meeting. Powell said the central bank needs \"greater confidence\" in inflation's path lower before cutting rates.\n\nEconomists believe the January jobs report, which showed the US economy added 353,000 jobs in the month, bolsters the Fed's case it can wait to cut interest rates without pushing the economy into recession. But the report also brought forth concerns about inflation reaccelerating, as wages increased 4.6% in the month, the highest pace of growth since July 2023.\n\n\"After the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, we maintained confidence in our expectation of a March rate cut,\" Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"After today's data, however, it is hard to see how that is going to happen. Barring a significant turnaround in the February data, or very weak inflation data between now and mid-March, it is much more likely that the FOMC will hold policy rates steady in March.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are now placing a roughly 20% chance on a interest rate cut at the March meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. On Thursday, there had been a nearly 40% chance and a month ago nearly an 80% chance.\n\nEarnings check-in\n\nCorporate earnings appeared to round a corner to end last week. After S&P 500 earnings had been posting a more than 1% decline for the quarter, a swath of earnings in the past week flipped the narrative headline with earnings beats from tech stalwarts Apple, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, per FactSet.\n\nThe latest data from FactSet shows earnings are expected to grow 1.6% in the fourth quarter. And notably, estimates for the first quarter have been kept in check too. In the past month analysts have trimmed first quarter earnings estimates by 1.4%, less than the five-year average of a 2.1% cut.\n\n104 S&P 500 companies are slated to report earnings this week, per FactSet.\n\nMainly quiet on the economic front\n\nAfter an onslaught of economic data that's showed the US economy is off to a hot start to the first quarter, investors will have few data points to dissect in the week ahead. Weekly initial jobless claims will continue to be closely tracked as companies announce layoffs while an update on activity in the services sector on Monday will catch investor attention.

The company anticipates fourth-quarter comps to be in the high-single-digit range.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Arista Networks, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Netflix, DaVita and Royal Caribbean Cruises",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 February 1, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Arista Networks ANET, Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG, Netflix NFLX, DaVita DVA and Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nStrong January Is a Good Omen for Wall Street: 5 Growth Picks\n\nThe S&P 500, after posting a whopping 24% gain in 2023, is continuing its winning streak this year. The S&P 500 enjoys a bull market and has touched record highs after spinning in a tight trading range for quite some time.\n\nThe broader index gained more than 3% in January, as solid economic growth crushed recession fearmongering while inflationary pressure cooled down to levels that encouraged the Federal Reserve to take a dovish stance.\n\nThe uptick in consumer outlays and strength in the labor market helped the U.S. economy expand at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which followed an annual growth of 4.9% in the third quarter, per the Commerce Department. Strong back-to-back readings came in despite the Fed's monetary tightening measures.\n\nIn reality, consumer spending increased by 2.8% in the final quarter of 2023, while business investments and government spending also improved. On the other hand, jobs are being added to the economy at a steady clip and the jobless rate remains low.\n\nNeedless to say, economic slowdown fears are now on the back burner, with most of the respondents surveyed by the National Association of Business Economics agreeing that there is a 50% or less chance of the U.S. economy heading into a recession in the upcoming one-year span as prices pressures have eased and supply-chain issues have ebbed.\n\nTalking about inflation, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index, increased only 1.7% in the fourth quarter, less than the 2.6% increase in the third quarter, and very much around the Fed's target of 2%. With price pressures falling, the Fed is expected to trim interest rates this year, which boosts consumer spending and business investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, with things looking up for the economy, the stock market is poised to gain for the rest of the year. Historically, the rest of the year's performance is dependent on how stocks performed in January, better known as the \"January barometer.\" If the S&P 500 finishes in the green in January, then it's expected to post positive results for the remainder of the year.\n\nMoreover, Bespoke Investment Group stated that when the S&P 500 gained more than 2% in January, its median performance for the remaining year was an increase of 13.5%. Hence, on this heartening note, it is prudent for investors to place their bets on fundamentally sound growth stocks that can make the most of the stock market's upward journey.\n\nSome of the prominent names are Arista Networks, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Netflix, DaVita and Royal Caribbean Cruises. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nArista Networks is engaged in providing cloud networking solutions. Arista Networks currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.6% over the past 90 days. ANET's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 43%.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains. Chipotle Mexican Grill currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.2% over the past 60 days. CMG's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 34.6%.\n\nNetflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. Netflix currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 6.3% over the past 60 days. NFLX's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 40.7%.\n\nDaVita is a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States. DaVita currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 9.2% over the past 90 days. DVA's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 22.3%.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises is a cruise company. Royal Caribbean Cruises currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.6% over the past 60 days. RCL's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 188.4%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "content": "Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN) stock has underperformed the market, but the stock has a lot of potential, starting with its 5.2% dividend yield. Contrarian investors will find that there\u2019s quite a bit to like here. I\u2019m bullish on the $3.9 billion fast food stock, given its juicy dividend yield, its relatively inexpensive valuation compared to its restaurant stock peers, and several catalysts that could lead to a turnaround, such as a new CEO taking over and new involvement from activist investors who could push for further changes.\n\nNew CEO, New Activist Investors\n\nWendy\u2019s stock has slumped to a 14.0% loss over the past year, at a time when the S&P 500 (SPX) surged to a 21.8% gain, so some changes are likely needed, and changes are coming.\n\nWendy\u2019s recently announced that a new CEO, Kirk Tanner, will take the helm on February 5. Tanner has been at Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) for over 30 years and is currently leading the company\u2019s massive North American beverage business. While it\u2019s too early to say what Tanner\u2019s strategy will be, he appears to have the right kind of background for this role, and a fresh start under a new CEO could help to reinvigorate the business and the stock price.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly precedent for this in the restaurant industry. For example, former Taco Bell CEO Brian Niccol took over as Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) CEO in 2018 and has created tremendous value for shareholders in that time. Chipotle\u2019s stock price has more than tripled since he took over. I\u2019m not saying that this move by Wendy\u2019s will necessarily have the same level of impact, but the example shows that a change in leadership can be a catalyst for stocks in this industry.\n\nIn terms of other potential catalysts (or wildcards), Wendy\u2019s is also facing renewed pressure from activist investors, which could benefit shareholders.\n\nWhile legendary investor Nelson Peltz (who is now Wendy\u2019s Chairman of the Board) dropped his efforts to take the company private, a new activist is engaging in saber-rattling of its own. In December, Reuters reported that Blackwells Capital, an activist hedge fund, has plans to challenge Wendy\u2019s Board of Directors (namely Peltz) and to push for various improvements, although it\u2019s unclear what they are at this time.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say what the dynamic between the new CEO, Peltz, and the new activists will be, but with all of these new elements in play, more changes are likely on the horizon.\n\nTasty Dividend\n\nWhat I really like about Wendy\u2019s stock is that it packs a punch with its dividend. Shares of Wendy\u2019s currently yield an attractive 5.2%.\n\nThis yield is well above that of the average yield for the S&P 500 (SPX), which currently sits at 1.5%.\n\nNot only that, but Wendy\u2019s also yields significantly more than its closest peers like McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) (TSE:QSR), the parent company of Burger King, which yield 2.1% and 2.8%, respectively.\u00a0Wendy\u2019s yield is also significantly higher than that of Taco Bell parent Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), which currently yields just 1.9%.\n\nWendy\u2019s doubled its dividend payout in 2023 (from $0.125 per quarter to $0.25), a strong signal that it is committed to creating value for its shareholders. In addition to this big-time dividend, Wendy\u2019s is also returning capital to shareholders via share repurchases. In 2023, Wendy\u2019s committed to buying back $500 million worth of shares through 2027, a significant amount for a company with a $3.9 billion market cap.\n\nCheaper Than the Market and Fast Food Peers\n\nTrading at 19.3 times earnings and 17.3 times projected 2024 earnings, shares of Wendy\u2019s aren\u2019t so cheap that value investors are going to be pounding the table over it, but they are cheaper than the broader market and those of its closest peers.\n\nThe S&P 500 currently trades at 22.1 times earnings. McDonald\u2019s trades at 24.7 times trailing earnings and 23.3 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International trades at 23.7 times trailing earnings and 22.4 times forward earnings. Similarly, YUM! Brands trades at 24.3 times trailing earnings and 22.2 times forward earnings.\n\nThese comparisons illustrate that there is plenty of room for Wendy\u2019s to attain a higher multiple in line with its restaurant peers and for shares to trade higher if the new management team can right the ship.\n\nIs WEN Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, WEN earns a Hold consensus rating based on three Buys, 11 Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average WEN stock price target of $21.73 implies 13.9% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: Wendy\u2019s Stock Looks Attractive\n\nShares of Wendy\u2019s look attractive based on its 5.2% dividend yield and the possibility that changes driven by its new CEO or by activist investors could help bring its valuation more in line with those of its peers.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "15 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In The World",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 countries with the highest labor shortages In the world. We have also discussed the latest labor shortages in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In The World.\n\nThe aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic is often called 'The Great Resignation, as it witnessed a major labor force disruption in the United States. With over 50 million workers quitting their jobs in 2022, following a trend of 47.8 million resignations in 2021, the workforce experienced a shift. However, in 2023, this trend began to ease, with 30.5 million workers resigning by August.\n\nAs workers sought improved work-life balance, flexibility, higher compensation, or a stable company culture, it drove them to transition to other jobs. As the US Chamber of Commerce closely monitors job opening trends, labor force participation, and quit rates countrywide, it noticed how certain industries bear the brunt of these dynamics. Despite American businesses creating hundreds of thousands of jobs monthly, there's a major shortage, particularly in the professional and business service sector. Hence, to cope with shortages, businesses around the US are engaging in deals and collaborations to fill their job positions as quickly as possible.\n\nFor instance, United Parcel Service, Inc (NYSE:UPS) recently made a deal with the Teamsters Union, promising United Parcel Service, Inc (NYSE:UPS) drivers an average of $170,000 per year. This could solve the long-standing problem of truck drivers shortages. The job has often been overlooked and not well-paid, making it unattractive to job seekers. The new agreement aims to change that by offering better pay and benefits. United Parcel Service, Inc (NYSE:UPS) hopes that by investing more in its drivers, it will boost productivity and bring about positive changes in the logistics industry.\n\nWhile United Parcel Service, Inc (NYSE:UPS)\u2019s stock initially dropped because of this deal's costs, it's seen as a necessary step. The $170,000 package is designed to attract experienced drivers, essential for successful parcel delivery. This decision also sets the stage for introducing new technologies like drones and hubs in the delivery process.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the growing labor shortages, a number of industries are being revolutionized by AI and automation and the fast food industry is no exception. For example, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc (NYSE:CMG) is testing an avocado-cutting robot, \"Autocado,\" designed to reduce guacamole prep time by 50% and thus, addresses a task that takes employees about 50 minutes. While the robot efficiently cuts, cores, and peels avocados, human employees still handle tasks like hand-mashing and adding ingredients. The robot is developed in collaboration with Vebu Labs and is part of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc (NYSE:CMG)\u2019s initiatives to improve employee experiences, including faster grills and order streamlining.\n\nNevertheless, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc (NYSE:CMG) is set to hire 19,000 employees in anticipation of its busy \"burrito season\" from March to May. The company introduced new benefits to address Gen Z's financial challenges. The benefits include a free Employee Assistance Programme with six counseling sessions, tackling mental wellbeing. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc (NYSE:CMG) will pay off student debt and contribute up to 4% of an employee's salary to their 401(k) when eligible, using SoFi's Student Loan Verification. Additional perks involve financial education from SoFi and credit score improvement through Cred.ai. 15 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In The World\n\nA porcine cell platform in a Mount Sinai Hospital laboratory with medical professionals operating a microscope.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor countries with the highest labor shortages in the world, we utilized Manpower Group\u2019s Report on Talent Shortages for 2024 to get the percentage by country of skilled labor shortage. In the case of similar skilled labor shortage percentages, we utilized the World Bank\u2019s data on the ageing population (as % of total population) by country as tiebreaker. The country with a higher percentage of ageing population was ranked higher.\n\nIn case both the ageing population and skilled labour shortages percentages are similar for the two countries, we have looked at permanent migrants accepted in 2021 to break the tie. The list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Singapore\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage: 79%\n\nAgeing Population: 15%\n\nSingapore is addressing its workforce shortages by hiring 260,000 professionals, with a focus on IT & Software, Banking, and Engineering sectors. The hiring surge comes in response to a decline of 194,000 foreign workers during the pandemic. Sales and compliance specialists, engineers, software developers, product managers, and AI specialists are particularly sought after. Singapore is one of the countries with a shortage of IT professionals.\n\n14. Slovakia\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage: 79%\n\nAgeing Population: 17%\n\nIn 2022, Slovakia witnessed a major increase in Indian workers, quadrupling their numbers to 1,350 due to severe staff shortages in the IT and automotive sectors. The Labour, Social Affairs, and Family Office confirmed this spike, highlighting the assistance provided by citizens from India and other Asian countries in filling crucial job vacancies, such as truck drivers and welders. The trend continues, with the Jaguar Land Rover factory in Nitra hiring an additional 173 workers from India.\n\n13. Romania\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage: 79%\n\nAgeing Population: 19%\n\nA 2019 national study in Romania highlighted a 300,000-person labor shortage, projected to reach 549,000 by 2023. Randstad HR Trends Study suggested a workforce deficit of one million in the country. Migration of professionals which includes healthcare workers, temporary laborers, IT specialists, and students, contributes to this gap. It is one of the countries facing the greatest skill shortages.\n\n12. Hongkong\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage: 79%\n\nAgeing Population: 20%\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Hong Kong plans to address a labor shortage by easing entry rules and recruiting 27,000 foreign workers, targeting sectors with severe shortages such as construction and aviation. It is one of the countries with shortage of skilled workers.\n\n11. Brazil\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage: 80%\n\nAgeing Population: 10%\n\nBrazil is facing critical labor shortages in key sectors and services such as health, and ICT, as outlined by the 2018 OECD Skills for Jobs database. Occupations in personal care, protective services, and health professionals show a huge deficit, with a shortage of medical imaging technicians and ICT professionals, numbering in the thousands. Customer service clerks and business professionals are also in high demand. In contrast, there's a surplus in electrical trades, metal-related trades, and sales workers.\n\n10. United Kingdom\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage: 80%\n\nAgeing Population: 19%\n\nForeign interest in UK jobs has doubled since the post-Brexit points-based immigration system began, especially from non-EU countries like India and Nigeria, according to Indeed. The share of foreign job searches rose to 5.5% in June 2023, compared to 2.2% in April 2021. The top job categories are social care and software development. The number of permanent migrants accepted in the UK in 2021 was 338,300. The UK is the also one of the best countries for education.\n\n9. Canada\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage: 80%\n\nAgeing Population: 19%\n\nCanada plans to welcome 485,000 permanent residents in 2024, rising to 500,000 in 2025 and maintaining the same in 2026. The Immigration Levels Plan focuses on addressing labor shortages, promoting economic growth, and family reunification. French-speaking immigration targets increase to 8% by 2026. Critical sectors like health, STEM, trades, and agriculture are prioritized. Express Entry aims for 117,500 admissions yearly, and Provincial Nominee Program targets 120,000 by 2025. The number of permanent migrants accepted in 2021 in Canada was 401,100.\n\n8. France\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage: 80%\n\nAgeing Population: 22%\n\nFrance's hydrogen sector faces a workforce challenge and hence, requires tens of thousands of workers by 2030, with over 100,000 projected jobs. However, labor shortages and insufficient training have been hindering progress. In 2022, 6,800 positions existed in the sector, up 77% from 2019. It is one of the countries with labour shortage in Europe.\n\n7. India\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage: 81%\n\nAgeing Population: 7%\n\nIndia is facing a unique labor challenge despite a growing workforce. Annually, 12 million young Indians enter the job market, set to reach 1.04 billion by 2030. Despite this demographic advantage, India grapples with a shortage of skilled and unskilled labor. The implications are vast and will affect both its domestic and international manufacturing capabilities. It is one of the top 10 countries with the highest labor shortages in the world.\n\n6. Ireland\n\nSkilled Labor Shortage: 81%\n\nAgeing Population: 15%\n\nIreland is struggling with a severe labor shortage crisis, as revealed by an Irish Sun investigation.

        "title": "Strong January is a Good Omen for Wall Street: 5 Growth Picks",
        "content": "The S&P 500, after posting a whopping 24% gain in 2023, is continuing its winning streak this year. The S&P 500 enjoys a bull market and has touched record highs after spinning in a tight trading range for quite some time.\n\nThe broader index gained more than 3% in January, as solid economic growth crushed recession fearmongering while inflationary pressure cooled down to levels that encouraged the Federal Reserve to take a dovish stance.\n\nThe uptick in consumer outlays and strength in the labor market helped the U.S. economy expand at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which followed an annual growth of 4.9% in the third quarter, per the Commerce Department. Strong back-to-back readings came in despite the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening measures.\n\nIn reality, consumer spending increased by 2.8% in the final quarter of 2023, while business investments and government spending also improved. On the other hand, jobs are being added to the economy at a steady clip and the jobless rate remains low.\n\nNeedless to say, economic slowdown fears are now on the back burner, with most of the respondents surveyed by the National Association of Business Economics agreeing that there is a 50% or less chance of the U.S. economy heading into a recession in the upcoming one-year span as prices pressures have eased and supply-chain issues have ebbed.\n\nTalking about inflation, the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index, increased only 1.7% in the fourth quarter, less than the 2.6% increase in the third quarter, and very much around the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. With price pressures falling, the Fed is expected to trim interest rates this year, which boosts consumer spending and business investments.\n\nThus, with things looking up for the economy, the stock market is poised to gain for the rest of the year. Historically, the rest of the year\u2019s performance is dependent on how stocks performed in January, better known as the \u201cJanuary barometer.\u201d If the S&P 500 finishes in the green in January, then it's expected to post positive results for the remainder of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Bespoke Investment Group stated that when the S&P 500 gained more than 2% in January, its median performance for the remaining year was an increase of 13.5%. Hence, on this heartening note, it is prudent for investors to place their bets on fundamentally sound growth stocks that can make the most of the stock market\u2019s upward journey.\n\nSome of the prominent names are Arista Networks ANET, Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG, Netflix NFLX, DaVita DVA and Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL.

        "content": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over Chipotle Mexican Grill's (NYSE:CMG) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Chipotle Mexican Grill:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.22 = US$1.5b \u00f7 (US$7.9b - US$1.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nThus, Chipotle Mexican Grill has an ROCE of 22%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 9.4%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Chipotle Mexican Grill  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Chipotle Mexican Grill's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Chipotle Mexican Grill here  for free.\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill deserves to be commended in regards to it's returns. The company has employed 273% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 22%. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 22%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If Chipotle Mexican Grill can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 359% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a final note, we've found  1 warning sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill that we think you should be aware of.\n\nHigh returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Ahead of February Earnings",
        "content": "This earnings season is particularly mixed, making the list of stocks to watch before earnings especially impactful if you\u2019re interested in directional trades. Even if not, keeping a close watch on some major stocks ahead of their earnings date can help give you a better idea of how the overall market landscape is developing \u2013 for good or for bad.\n\nThe S&P 500 is marking all-time highs, and of the companies in the index that reported thus far, nearly 70% posted a positive EPS surprise. Great news, right?\n\nDespite individual company strengths (or analysts\u2019 misaligned expectations), the index\u2019s collective earnings marked a 1.4% year-over-year (YoY) decline \u2013 not a particularly bullish indicator, considering how different the sentiment was this time last year. Likewise, though many companies have yet to report, a sizeable percentage are offering negative EPS guidance as they face greater uncertainty than current index pricing indicates.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat all this means is that, increasingly, we can\u2019t rely on a \u201cstocks go up\u201d theory of earnings when evaluating short-term trades. At the same time, though, some overbought individual stocks seem to be a house of cards propping up a shaky market \u2013 making bets on them a risky proposition.\n\nHere are a handful of top stocks to watch before earnings \u2013 alongside whether or not they\u2019re worth a buy at this stage in the game.\n\nBuy: Palantir (PLTR)\n\nEarnings Date: Monday, February 5th (After Hours) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the many well-known stocks reporting in February, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is the easiest to call a Buy today. After four consecutive profitable quarters, the AI and data analytics software firm is well on its way to marking its fifth. Right now, analysts are projecting earnings roughly aligned with last quarter\u2019s, which hit a $0.07 EPS. If the thesis bears out, that represents a 100% jump on a YoY basis, which supports the collective consensus that the company will grow 85% annually over the next five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nA major tailwind for Palantir is that it\u2019s now eligible for S&P 500 inclusion after four consecutive profitable periods. Palantir is already larger, by market cap, than 3/5 of the current index holdings. At the same time, applied AI will likely continue propelling Palantir forward. In many cases, the AI bubble is borderline bursting \u2013 \u201cnormal\u201d companies, i.e., those without a clear AI use case, failed to demonstrate how adopting current AI tech benefited their bottom line. That\u2019s despite the constant usage of AI-adjacent buzzwords in marketing materials and earnings calls.\n\nBut Palantir is one of the few companies with a clear, demonstrable, and viable AI platform that existed well before the current craze. Palantir\u2019s wide-ranging AI offerings help across unique use cases, including combat targeting, intelligence, corporate data insight, public health forecasting, and more. As investors lose enthusiasm for AI labeling stamped across every company\u2019s face, Palantir stands out as one of the few that will weather the imminent drawdown.\n\nSell before Earnings: Chipotle (CMG)\n\nEarnings Date: Tuesday, February 6th (After Hours) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) consumer sentiment is slowly turning against Chipotle, as a cursory social media search sees scores of dissatisfied customers complaining about slow and incorrect orders, poor ingredient quality, and a general feeling that the once-hot burrito company isn\u2019t what it used to be. This is likely due, in no small part, to increased emphasis on cost-cutting at the expense of what made Chipotle the hot stock it is today. Of course, quantifying social sentiment of this type is difficult, but a look at CMG\u2019s fundamentals reinforces a Sell rating.\n\nFrom the outset, CMG\u2019s basic ratios skew far too high for comfort, trading at 55x earnings and 22x book value. Likewise, it trades at 1.75x earnings growth \u2013 all of which indicates gross overvaluation in light of its relatively precarious position as a pricy fast food alternative, social sentiment aside. The company\u2019s YoY EPS growth is strong, to be sure \u2013 nearly 40% in last year\u2019s report, but the stat is trending downward to align itself more closely with CMG\u2019s 10-year growth average of just 13.86%.\n\nUltimately, Chipotle is a restaurant mainstay, and the stock isn\u2019t going anywhere soon. But its current per-share price is far too overblown to be worth investing in now, and if you\u2019re a shareholder, I\u2019d be concerned that just a hint of bad news could send shares tumbling faster than it takes to order a burrito bowl.\n\nBuy: McDonald\u2019s (MCD)\n\nEarnings Date: Monday, February 5th (Pre-Market) Man holds out a McDonald's bag with the golden arches logo on it at a drive-thru window.\n\nSource: Gargantiopa / Shutterstock\n\nOn the fast food flip side, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) remains a strong Buy as it prepares to be one of the first stocks reporting earnings in February. Across the board, top analysts are bullish on McDonald\u2019s. One Wedbush analyst said that it\u2019s \u201chard to see McDonald\u2019s not \u2018winning\u2019 in any consumer environment.\u201d At the same time, a Jefferies rating expert took to CNBC to call McDonald\u2019s a top pick in the restaurant industry as the \u201cbest defensive and offensive play in restaurants,\u201d with \u201cresiliency in an uncertain or weak macro [economic climate].\n\nBut the widely enthusiastic endorsement isn\u2019t backed up by MCD\u2019s per-share pricing; the stock climbed just under 8% over the preceding 12 months and lost about 2% since January 1st. A tough 2022 didn\u2019t help the cause, as McDonald\u2019s posted an annual revenue and income decrease alongside a slim margin improvement. But, on the heels of right-sizing operations and improved economic outlook, analysts expect the company to post a 7% EPS jump and 9% revenue growth in its upcoming earnings.\n\nSell before Earnings: PayPal (PYPL)\n\nEarnings Date: Wednesday, February 7th (After Hours) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite the CEO\u2019s plans to \u201cshock the world,\u201d PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) seems destined to disappoint this earnings season. In a bizarre attempt to ape Steve Jobs\u2019 vibe, the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in payment processing turned out to be new checkout procedures that \u201c[replace] cumbersome password inputs with biometric alternatives like face or fingerprint recognition.\u201d That\u2019s right \u2013 PayPal\u2019s revolutionary news is that it finally caught up to a range of existing applications that offer exactly that.\n\nUnsurprisingly, shares dipped slightly after the underwhelming Innovation Day proceedings, though the stock is up slightly since the month began. But it may not stay solid for long, as PayPal\u2019s house of cards could quickly crack on just a hint of poor outcomes. PayPal\u2019s market share domination sets it apart from the competition, to be fair. But competition is increasing, and though PayPal tends to be a top pick for computer-based payment processing, it lags significantly on mobile \u2013 where the bulk of tomorrow\u2019s digital shoppers buy things today (see the next paragraph for specifics!).\n\nBuy: Apple (AAPL)\n\nEarnings Date: Thursday, February 1st (After Hours) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough I alluded to the company in the previous paragraph, Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent pivots point to long-term strength that makes the stock a buy despite its fairly high per-share pricing. Specifically, Apple\u2019s emphasis on services \u2013 like Apple Pay and its podcasting platform \u2013 represents a cheap, high-margin flywheel that\u2019s already dominating some specific consumer sectors.\n\nThe top-line stats for Apple Pay alone are, frankly, astonishing. They reinforce the bull thesis for Apple while cementing PayPal\u2019s increasing irrelevance to tomorrow\u2019s shopping ecosystem. Apple Pay has already captured 92% of the digital wallet marketplace, processing 12.6% of all online consumer payments in 2023, with 48% of customers using the digital wallet for in-person transactions. Those stats mark a new age for Apple while signaling a death knell for PayPal\u2019s past dominance.\n\nFrom a hardware perspective, Apple is also focusing on creating greater verticals throughout its supply chain to protect against the kind of geopolitical shock we see with increased regularity. The company\u2019s renewed in-house component production efforts will help it cut costs while ensuring quality and, of course, protect against supply chain shocks moving forward.\n\nSell before Earnings: Alibaba Group (BABA)\n\nEarnings Date: Wednesday, February 7th (Pre-Market) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nSaying that Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is a Sell is a tough call. On one hand, the company\u2019s per-share pricing is closer than ever to its IPO debut cost and worth just a third of its 2020 high. And, unlike many other ZIRP-era high flyers, BABA isn\u2019t a flash in the pan.\n\nUnfortunately, pure economic risk in China puts too much pressure on this stock to make it worth buying before earnings. And, while that topic is a bit too complex to look at, other factors are pressuring BABA stock that make it worth selling before earnings.\n\nDespite its size, there\u2019s little real moat involved in BABA\u2019s operational model. That\u2019s clear as a primary competitor, Piunduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) beat BABA as the top eCommerce stock in China. Both companies\u2019 core value proposition is rock-bottom pricing. But, while BABA focused on overseas manufacturing, Piunduoduo\u2019s China-specific emphasis lets it snag market share away. At the same time, those supply chain shocks mentioned in the last paragraph pressure BABA\u2019s overseas shipments, and companies are increasingly looking elsewhere, like Latin America, for scaled production.\n\nSell: Affirm Holdings (AFRM)\n\nEarnings Date: Thursday, February 8th (After Hours) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nI covered the Sell thesis behind Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) last week, but it\u2019s worth revisiting before the company posts earnings. This is also a fairly contrarian position, as the stock surged more than 185% over the past year. But I think this bubble is about to burst soon, if not after this upcoming earnings report.\n\nYou probably recognize that Affirm\u2019s core business revolves around its buy now, pay later (BNPL) model. This model essentially provides consumers with short-term micro-loans at the point of sale. However, for better or worse, the BNPL solutions tend to attract consumers with less-than-stellar credit. With credit card delinquency rates on the rise, it seems inevitable that Affirm will face a surge in unpaid BNPL loans.\n\nAffirm\u2019s latest financial statements reveal a significant increase in its allowance for credit losses (expected delinquency write-offs), which surged by over 10% year-over-year. This uptick occurred even before the holiday sales season when tons of consumers undoubtedly maxed out their credit cards and relied heavily on Affirm\u2019s BNPL services. Given the current consumer and macroeconomic trends, the short-term outlook for Affirm appears bleak, positioning it as one of the top stocks to sell before earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis Mexican food chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $9.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +17.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $2.49 billion, up 14.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.27% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Chipotle?\n\nFor Chipotle, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.30%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Chipotle will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Chipotle would post earnings of $10.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $11.36, delivering a surprise of +8.60%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nChipotle appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, McDonald's (MCD) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +8.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.47 billion, up 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for McDonald's has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.16%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that McDonald's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill a Decade Ago",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CMG for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Chipotle Mexican Grill's main business drivers.\n\nA Delaware corporation, Chipotle Mexican Grill, together with its subsidiaries, operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains. The company was founded in 1993 by Steve Ells, who started with a single restaurant in Denver, CO. The company offers a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and salads. Chipotle restaurants feature free-range, hormone-free pork, natural chicken and other meat products cooked using traditional methods and served in a unique atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe company is committed to using high-quality real ingredients, classic cooking techniques and distinctive interior design to serve customers. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company owned and operated about 3,321 restaurants across the United States, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth is significantly driven by its digital platform. It has enhanced its capabilities by digitizing restaurant kitchens, expanding partnerships with third-party delivery services, and increasing the number of Chipotlanes (drive-through format for customer pick-up of digital orders). Digital sales, encompassing revenue generated through the Chipotle website, Chipotle app, or third-party delivery aggregators, which also includes revenue deferrals linked to Chipotle Rewards, constituted 39.4% of food and beverage revenue in 2022, compared to 45.0% in 2021. The company has facilitated convenient digital ordering through enhancements to the Chipotle app and website, including unlimited customization, contactless delivery, and group ordering.\r\n\r\nThe company utilizes multiple marketing channels, including national television, digital marketing, social media, fundraising, events and sponsorships to reach consumers. Third-party service providers mostly provide delivery services.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Chipotle launched a loyalty program called Chipotle Rewards, which provides customers with the opportunity to earn bonus points or free food. Earned rewards generally expire one to six months after they are issued and points typically expire if an account is inactive for six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Chipotle Mexican Grill ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in January 2014 would be worth $4,962.91, or a gain of 396.29%, as of January 30, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 177.76% and the price of gold increased 57.24% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for CMG too.\n\nShares of Chipotle have outperformed the industry in the past year. The company benefits from its digital efforts, Chipotlane add-ons and marketing initiatives. This and strength in digital sales, a rise in menu prices and new restaurant openings have been driving the company. Also, a strong comparable restaurant sales growth bodes well. Going forward, it continues to focus on the stage gate process and leveraging digital programs to expand access and convenience. Earnings estimates for 2024 have increased in the past 30 days, depicting analysts optimism regarding the stock growth potential. However, supply chain challenges, elevated wage inflation and expenses associated with new menus remain headwinds. For fourth-quarter 2023, the company anticipates the cost of sales to be around 30%.\n\nThe stock is up 5.14% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 6 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Investor\u2019s Business Daily regularly runs a feature called Top Funds\u2019 Latest Sells. Specifically, the newspaper publishes a list of equities in which many more of the best-performing stock funds are selling than buying. In general, stock funds tend to determine the direction of individual names. Moreover, top funds often have access to much more information and data than individual retail investors. Consequently, it\u2019s quite useful for long-term investors to know which stocks most major, top-performing funds are selling. I recommend that investors unload these stocks dropped by funds in the third quarter. I\u2019ve described powerful, negative catalysts for each stock as well.\n\nChubb (CB) Person holding cellphone with logo of Swiss insurance company Chubb Limited on screen in front of business webpage. CB stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nIn Q3, 45 funds sold property/casualty insurer Chubb (NYSE:CB), while only nine acquired CB stock.\n\nEarlier this month, Goldman Sachsdowngraded its rating on CB from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d citing its caution on \u201ccommercial line insurers.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChubb\u2019s \u201ccore operating income\u201d jumped to $4.95 in Q3, up from $3.13 during the same period a year earlier.\n\nHowever, perhaps boding poorly for its longer term outlook, the company\u2019s underwriting income dropped to $1.3 billion from $1.43 billion in the previous quarter. Also noteworthy is that insurers\u2019 catastrophe losses are expected to intensify over the long term due to climate change.\n\nThe stock\u2019s trailing price/earnings ratio of 14 is not especially cheap, while its dividend yield of 1.4% is nothing to write home about.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q3, 24 top-performing funds unloaded Chipotle\u2019s (NYSE:CMG) stock, while only 15 bought the name.\n\nValuation is likely a major concern for funds regarding Chipotle as its forward price-earnings ratio is 43. That\u2019s a very steep valuation for a restaurant stock.\n\nMeanwhile, Bank of Americarecently identified CMG as the \u201cmost crowded\u201d stock within the consumer discretionary sector. Specifically, the bank stated that 26% of all funds own the name.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe dichotomy between the Bank of America note and the Investor\u2019s Business Daily report could indicate that top funds are selling the name ahead of a significant decline by the overbought shares.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that CMG has steep competition, as Taco Bell, Qdoba, and Moe\u2019s Southwest Grill are just some of the many Mexican-inspired food chains with which CMG competes.\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q3, 64 top funds unloaded health insurer UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), while only 29 such funds bought the name.\n\nThe status of UNH as one of the stocks dropped by most funds turned out to be quite justified as UNH stock recently dropped to its lowest levels since September, driven by concerns about higher costs and lower margins for UNH and its peers.\n\nIndeed, the operating margin of the company\u2019s core UnitedHealthcare health insurer slipped to 4.4% last year from 7.7% in 2022. Moreover, its medical care ratio\u2014the revenue it spent on its clients\u2019 medical care\u2014increased to 83.2% last year versus 82% in 2022.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s top line jumped 14% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, and its earnings per share climbed about 16% year-over-year, the Street was not pleased about its margins issues.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire was the profit warning UNH\u2019s competitor, Humana (NYSE:HUM), issued on Jan. 18. Specifically, HUM cut its adjusted full-year earnings per share guidance to $26.09 from \u201cat least\u201d $28.25. The firm cited higher medical costs as the key reason for the revision.\n\nGiven rapidly rising drug costs, the quickly escalating costs of healthcare costs in general, and the fairly quick aging of the U.S. population, higher medical costs could indeed continue to plague UNH and its peers going forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We are in the first leg of the fourth-quarter 2023 earnings season. The results have so far shown stability, mostly in line with expectations. The earnings results and management guidance will be crucial for market participants to gauge the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nQ4 Earnings So Far\n\nAs of Jan 26, 124 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their financial numbers. Total earnings for these 52 index members are down 0.4% from the same period last year on 3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAt present, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index in fourth-quarter 2024 are expected to be up 1.1% on 2.4% higher revenues. This follows the 3.8% earnings growth on 2% higher revenues in the third quarter and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings before that.\n\nQ4 2023 At a Glance\n\nThe last quarter was an impressive one for Wall Street. The three major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 rallied 13.6%, 12.5% and 11.2%, respectively. Investors\u2019 confidence in risky assets like equities was boosted as the Fed indicated in its December FOMC meeting that the interest rate-hike regime might have come to an end, and rate cuts could be expected as early as in first-quarter 2024. U.S. stock markets, especially the growth sectors, regained pace after a brief halt from August to October.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five growth stocks that are poised to beat on earnings results next week.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has Just 7 Stocks in His Portfolio. Are Any of Them Right for You?",
        "content": "Bill Ackman is one of the best-known hedge fund managers around.\n\nThe billionaire manager of Pershing Square Capital Management is an active poster on X (formerly Twitter) and he makes media appearances more than most of his hedge fund manager peers. He's been in the news for his activism at Harvard, but he's best known for his investments. In fact, at one time in his career, he was even dubbed \"Baby Buffett.\"\n\nAckman has made a number of high-profile investment bets, including shorting Herbalife, which failed, but he also made billions betting that the S&P 500 would fall as the coronavirus pandemic hit.\n\nToday, Pershing Square has $10.5 billion invested in just seven stocks. Let's take a look at each of the stocks in the portfolio, what they say about Ackman's investing style, and whether they are worth buying today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is now Ackman's biggest holding, making up 16.7% of the Pershing Square portfolio, across both classes of the stock. It's the newest holding in Pershing Square's portfolio as it was added in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAckman has explained that he sees the data the company generates from search and related products as giving it a competitive advantage in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). So far, the bet has paid off as Alphabet has outperformed the S&P 500, and the company also brushed off concerns (so far) that search would be disrupted by chatbots like ChatGPT.\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG), the popular fast-casual Tex-Mex restaurant chain, is Ackman's second-biggest holding. Pershing Square has held the stock since the third quarter of 2016, making it its third-longest-held stock. Ackman currently owns $1.75 billion worth of Chipotle, and that investment has paid off handsomely as the stock is up 451% since Sept. 30, 2016.\n\nAt the time of the initial purchase, Chipotle was still struggling with the fallout from its E. coli outbreak in 2015, making the move something of a contrarian bet. Ackman said he believed Chipotle was fixable, and he helped install Brian Niccol as CEO of the chain, who is credited with driving the turnaround.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Howard Hughes\n\nAckman's third-biggest holding is Howard Hughes (NYSE: HHH), a diversified real estate holding company whose properties include multifamily residential, hospitality, and seaports. He's also chairman of the company.\n\nHoward Hughes is Ackman's longest-held stock; he owned it as early as the fourth quarter of 2010, as a result of its spinoff from General Growth Properties. He's hiked his stake in the company recently. Currently, Pershing Square owns $1.57 billion of Howard Hughes, and it makes up 14.5% of the fund's portfolio. Since the company was spun off from General Growth, it's up 114%, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\n4. Restaurant Brands International\n\nRestaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR) is another top holding of Ackman's, making up 14.4% of his portfolio. Between this investment and Chipotle, over 30% of Pershing Square's money is in restaurant stocks.\n\nRestaurant Brands International is the owner of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, and Ackman helped engineer the merger that combined Tim Hortons and Burger King. The company bought Popeyes later. Restaurant Brands International has underperformed the S&P 500 slightly since it started trading in 2014.\n\n5. Hilton Worldwide\n\nAnother consumer stock is No. 5 on Ackman's list. That's Hilton Worldwide (NYSE: HLT), one of the largest hotel operators in the world, which makes up 14.3% of the Pershing Square portfolio. Ackman started buying the stock in the fourth quarter of 2018 and bought nearly 1 million more shares in the third quarter. Like the other consumer stocks on this list, Ackman seems to like it because it's a simple, predictable business that generates cash and has pricing power.\n\nHilton has outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2018, gaining 161% versus the S&P's gain of 94%.\n\n6. Lowe's\n\nHome improvement retailer Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) also fits into Ackman's approach to consumer stocks as it operates in a duopoly with Home Depot. As of the end of the third quarter, Pershing Square owns $1.47 billion of Lowe's stock, making up 13.6% of the portfolio.\n\nPershing Square started buying Lowe's in the second quarter of 2018, and Lowe's stock has increased 120% since then compared to a 79% return for the S&P 500.\n\nPart of Ackman's thesis is that Lowe's should be able to narrow its gap with Home Depot, and Lowe's has outperformed Home Depot since his initial purchase as well.\n\n7. Canadian Pacific Kansas City\n\nCanadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE: CP), a railroad, is the last stock in Ackman's portfolio, and it's unique on the list as the only representative from the industrial sector. Pershing Square first bought CPKC in the fourth quarter of 2021, and it now makes up 10.4% of its portfolio. Canadian Pacific avoided the bear market and has narrowly beaten the S&P 500 since the end of 2021.\n\nAckman had owned CPKC shares back in the 2010s, and he said it was a mistake that Pershing Square sold the stock the first time around. Like other railroad stocks, Canadian Pacific enjoys wide operating margins.\n\nThree stocks for your buy list\n\nMost of these stocks have outperformed the market while Ackman has owned them, but three stocks in his portfolio stand out from the rest. Those are Alphabet, Chipotle, and Canadian Pacific, each of which has a strong competitive advantage.\n\nAlphabet's products like search and YouTube essentially have monopolies in their respective industries and generate bumper profits.\n\nChipotle has dominated fast-casual dining for nearly a generation, and it's learned to excel at the digital channel, giving it a superior profit margin and a brighter growth opportunity.\n\nCanadian Pacific generates operating margins in the 40% range and is the only transnational railroad linking Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, following its acquisition of Kansas City Southern.\n\nIf you're looking to follow Ackman's lead, starting with one of those three stocks makes the most sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Riding the Momentum: 3 Steady-Growth Stocks to Watch in 2024",
        "content": "Investors can look at many factors before buying or selling a stock. Valuations, financials, and industry news are some of the information we can consider before investing in corporations.\n\nSome investors prioritize momentum in their investing decisions. The logic is that if a stock has been going up for quite a while, the corporation is probably doing a few things right that can lead to future gains. While this logic has some weaknesses, investors can conduct deeper analyses to determine if momentum is justified.\n\nThese three growth stocks have been riding momentum for a while and have the fundamentals to suggest continued success.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) offers beauty and cosmetics products that use cruelty-free ingredients. The mid-cap stock has been a magnet for momentum investors. Shares have almost tripled over the past year and are up by 1,752% over the past five years.\n\nStocks with this type of momentum often attract exuberant excitement and intense fears that this time will be different. Despite the rally, Elf Beauty is still reasonably valued with a 53-forward P/E ratio.\n\nRevenue and earnings accelerations make the cosmetics company appealing. The firm reported 76% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth and 184% YOY net income growth in Q2 of fiscal 2024.\n\nRecently, Elf Beauty suffered a 4% pullback on January 18th. Those types of downward movements can cause investors to panic, but they actually present a good opportunity to accumulate shares.\n\nThese downtrends can happen even if there isn\u2019t any news. In Elf Beauty\u2019s case, the news was\u00a0moving out of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index\u00a0and going into the S&P MidCap 400 Index instead. More funds track the former than the latter which resulted in an ELF stock losing value. That small drop has nothing to do with the underlying business and presents a buying opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlthough\u00a0Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) stock has been flat since mid-August, the company has gained 83% over the past year. The sports beverage company\u2019s 4,784% gain over the past five years demonstrates how much investors have accumulated this stock.\n\nThe firm is barely a large-cap stock with a $14 billion market cap. However, shares can soar much higher. Growth has been a common theme for the corporation which more than doubled its revenue and net income in the\u00a0third quarter. International sales are a minuscule part of the company\u2019s total revenue and are poised to ramp up in the coming quarters.\n\nCelsius Holdings has a lot of room to run if it can tap into international markets. The company\u2019s product is flying off the shelves in North America. CELH has a 57 forward P/E ratio which can get easier to justify when international sales start to come in.\n\nAnalysts feel optimistic about the company\u2019s long-term path. The\u00a0average price target from 14 analysts is $72.25 per share, which implies an upside above 20%. The highest price target is $83.33 and even the lowest price target of $64 presents some upside.\n\nValuation concerns may have contributed to the stock trading sideways since mid-August. However, those concerns should fade in 2024 as the company reports strong earnings. That scenario would help the stock generate momentum and reward patient investors.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is another company in the food industry. The corporation offers healthier fast food options than most restaurants and has rapidly expanded. The company has\u00a0over 3,300 locations throughout the U.S.\n\nCMG stock has delivered compelling returns for long-term investors. Shares are up by 54% over the past year and have gained 327% over the past five years. That type of momentum would make many investors happy, but can the stock deliver for new investors?\n\nThat\u2019s the question every momentum investor has to ask themselves before accumulating shares. Chipotle has demonstrated many promising signs for potential investors who are on the fence. The firm achieved 11.3% YOY revenue growth and 21.8% YOY net income growth in the\u00a0third quarter.\n\nShares trade at a 43-forward P/E ratio. It\u2019s more expensive than other fast food restaurants, but Chipotle trades at a premium for a reason. The company is generating high growth rates and looks poised to expand its market share in the years ahead.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF and CELH.
